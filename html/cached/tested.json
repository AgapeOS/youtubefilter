      "description": "At the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Arms and Armor conservation lab, Adam Savage is blown away by an armorer's complete collection of tools, but that's not all! Associate conservator Sean Belair explains the ancient art of damascening -- producing a design or pattern by inlaying a softer metal into a harder one -- and shows Adam some mind-blowing examples of that intricate geometric work, which would have been completed with simple tools like these. It's an emotional moment for Adam as he contemplates the tools and the work of these extraordinary makers.

      "description": "Small objects such as jewelry can be challenging for museums to display. It's not compelling to lie them down in a case; curators want as close to a 360-degree view as possible, and the items might also need to shown open or as if they were being worn. But NO one wants the mount to distract from the craftsmanship of the artifact, or to interfere with its preservation. Here are three examples of historic pieces of jewelry -- a watch from 1670, a bracelet from the 18th or 19th century,  and a 17th century pocket watch -- and their very unique mounts, as presented to Adam Savage by @metmuseum conservation preparators Jacob Goble, Warren Bennett and Laila Lott. \n\nMore about the watch: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194113\nMore about the hathphul: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/450394\nMore about the pocket watch: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194007\nMet's Object Conservation Department: https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/conservation-and-scientific-research/objects-conservation\nArt Preservation Hidden in Plain Sight: https://youtu.be/yf48x0EN-ls\nThis Wood-Turned Cup Is Actually 74 Cups! https://youtu.be/xhzZkD6gytg\nWhat Museums Don\u2019t Want You to Notice: https://youtu.be/u_-oUvv28dE\nAdam Savage Tours the  @metmuseum 's Workshop: https://youtu.be/GTZXkdlDpyo\nWhat's Special About This \u202a@metmuseum\u202c Mount? https://youtu.be/e-hqTkOHdNg\nThis Ancient Mace Hides a Big Surprise: https://youtu.be/mrMdYFJ0fqA\nAdam Savage Meets Real Armored Gauntlets: https://youtu.be/59-9PlB-F1Y\nAdam Savage Meets Real Ancient Swords: https://youtu.be/wJypHnsEn8o\nMore Met videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtitKU0CAeiUv8endzt93QO2_T96n_xe\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in Person: https://www.tested.com/events\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@testedcom\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/testedcom/\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/testedcom\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/testedcom\nDiscord: https://www.discord.gg/tested\nAmazon Storefront: http://www.amazon.com/shop/adamsavagestested\nAudio Described and Accessible Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtitKU0CAeiQLgj4PZ9onSW6YXIz5ADR\n\nIntro bumper by Abe Dieckman\n\nThanks for watching!",
