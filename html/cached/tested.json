It\u2019s taken years and countless millions spent to get to this point: a 98 gram pair of glasses with an optical display system that can put holograms almost everywhere your eyes can look and an input system that seemingly reads your mind. The catch: each pair costs almost $10,000 to make--the kind of moonshot device they internally call a Time Machine. Let's dive deep into how Orion\u2019s technology works, what it\u2019s like to use them, and what this Time Machine reveals about the future of augmented reality.\n\nShot by Joey Fameli and edited by Norman Chan\nMusic by Jinglepunks\nAdditional media courtesy of Meta\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in Person: https://www.tested.com/events\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@testedcom\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/testedcom/\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/testedcom\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/testedcom\nDiscord: https://www.discord.gg/tested\nAmazon Storefront: http://www.amazon.com/shop/adamsavagestested\n\nIntro bumper by Abe Dieckman\n\nThanks for watching!\n\n#augmentedreality #orion #handson",

      "description": "Small objects such as jewelry can be challenging for museums to display. It's not compelling to lie them down in a case; curators want as close to a 360-degree view as possible, and the items might also need to shown open or as if they were being worn. But NO one wants the mount to distract from the craftsmanship of the artifact, or to interfere with its preservation. Here are three examples of historic pieces of jewelry -- a watch from 1670, a bracelet from the 18th or 19th century,  and a 17th century pocket watch -- and their very unique mounts, as presented to Adam Savage by @metmuseum conservation preparators Jacob Goble, Warren Bennett and Laila Lott. \n\nMore about the watch: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194113\nMore about the hathphul: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/450394\nMore about the pocket watch: https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/194007\nMet's Object Conservation Department: https://www.metmuseum.org/about-the-met/conservation-and-scientific-research/objects-conservation\nArt Preservation Hidden in Plain Sight: https://youtu.be/yf48x0EN-ls\nThis Wood-Turned Cup Is Actually 74 Cups! https://youtu.be/xhzZkD6gytg\nWhat Museums Don\u2019t Want You to Notice: https://youtu.be/u_-oUvv28dE\nAdam Savage Tours the  @metmuseum 's Workshop: https://youtu.be/GTZXkdlDpyo\nWhat's Special About This \u202a@metmuseum\u202c Mount? https://youtu.be/e-hqTkOHdNg\nThis Ancient Mace Hides a Big Surprise: https://youtu.be/mrMdYFJ0fqA\nAdam Savage Meets Real Armored Gauntlets: https://youtu.be/59-9PlB-F1Y\nAdam Savage Meets Real Ancient Swords: https://youtu.be/wJypHnsEn8o\nMore Met videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtitKU0CAeiUv8endzt93QO2_T96n_xe\n\nSubscribe for more videos (and click the bell for notifications):  http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=testedcom\n\nJoin this channel to support Tested and get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiDJtJKMICpb9B1qf7qjEOA/join\nTested and Adam Savage Ts, stickers, (de) merit badges and more: https://tested-store.com\nAbout Tested: https://www.tested.com/about\nMeet Adam in Person: https://www.tested.com/events\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@testedcom\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/testedcom/\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/testedcom\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/testedcom\nDiscord: https://www.discord.gg/tested\nAmazon Storefront: http://www.amazon.com/shop/adamsavagestested\nAudio Described and Accessible Videos: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJtitKU0CAeiQLgj4PZ9onSW6YXIz5ADR\n\nIntro bumper by Abe Dieckman\n\nThanks for watching!",
