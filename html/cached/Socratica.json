      "description": "Both adjectives and adverbs can take on comparative and superlative forms.  Have trouble telling them apart?  Comparative adjectives compare two nouns, while comparative adverbs compare actions.  Superlatives tell you which is the most extreme - a superlative adjective describes the most extreme noun, while the superlative adverb is for extreme actions.  \n\nBefore watching this video, you might want to watch our videos on adjectives: http://bit.ly/1SUnH9G\nand adverbs: http://bit.ly/1LrHY4W\n\nYou have great ideas. But no one will know about them if you can't communicate effectively! Our series of Basic English Grammar Rules will help you brush up your language skills. People will pay attention to you ideas - not your grammar mistakes. Feel more confident about the SAT and the ACT.

The first was awarded in 1958, for finding the amino acid sequence of insulin (the first protein to be sequenced). Sanger won his second Nobel Prize in 1980, for his efficient method of sequencing DNA (his group had sequenced the genome of bacteriophage phiX174, as well as being the first to sequence human genes from mitochondria).  Sanger's research group is also remembered for sequencing rRNA from bacterial ribosomes. \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nLove Socratica?\nNever Miss an Upload!\nSubscribe here:  http://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nBiologist Biographies:\nLouis Pasteur  http://bit.ly/PasteurSocratica\nEdward Jenner     http://bit.ly/JennerSocratica\nFrederick Sanger   http://bit.ly/SangerSocratica\nRamon y Cajal   http://bit.ly/RamonyCajalSocratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nWant to Learn More? \nWe recommend the following books:\n\nFrederick Sanger, Double Laureate\nhttps://amzn.to/2raZG65\n\nAsimov\u2019s Chronology of Science & Discovery\nhttps://amzn.to/2jireBX\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nTo support more videos from Socratica, visit\n\nSocratica Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nSocratica Paypal\nhttps://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\nWe also accept Bitcoin!  :)\nOur address is:  1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nHost: Liliana de Castro\nArtwork:  Kim Parkhurst\nDirected by Michael Harrison \nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

When we say \"molar mass,\" we mean the mass of 1 mole of that compound. Sometimes it's called the Gram molecular mass . We'll also explain what is meant by gram formula mass.  That's a lot of terms that all sort of mean the same thing - so it's no wonder people get confused.  We'll work through 5 examples. \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 What is Molar Mass\n0:42 Example 1 - molar mass of water\n2:34 Example 2 - molar mass of glucose\n4:12 Example 3 - molar mass of table salt (NaCl)\n4:55 Example 4 - application: how many moles of water in 50 g\n6:47 Example 5 - application: how many grams are in 12.6 moles of glucose\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

So how come it doesn't say exactly 12 on the periodic table? Because there's more than one kind of carbon.  In this video, we work through two examples of determining the average atomic mass for an element - which is a weighted average of all the different isotopes of that element. \n\nYou can click on the links below to jump to sections in the lesson:\n0:00 What is Average Atomic Mass\n2:27 Example 1:  average atomic mass of carbon\n5:34 Example 2: average atomic mass of oxygen\n\nIn this video, we refer to the definition of an isotope.

      "description": "Matrices are a great example of infinite, nonabelian groups.  Here we introduce matrix groups with an emphasis on the general linear group and special linear group.  The general linear group is written as GLn(F), where F is the field used for the matrix elements.  The most common examples are GLn(R) and GLn(C).  Similarly, the special linear group is written as SLn.\n\nBe sure to subscribe so you don't miss new lessons from Socratica:  \nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend the following textbooks:\nDummit & Foote, Abstract Algebra 3rd Edition\nhttp://amzn.to/2oOBd5S\n\nMilne, Algebra Course Notes (available free online)\nhttp://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/index.html \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n \n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nTeaching\u200b \u200bAssistant:\u200b \u200b\u200b \u200bLiliana\u200b \u200bde\u200b \u200bCastro \nWritten\u200b \u200b&\u200b \u200bDirected\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bMichael\u200b \u200bHarrison \nProduced\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bKimberly\u200b \u200bHatch\u200b \u200bHarrison\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

      "description": "Lots of people mix up \"affect\" and \"effect.\"  But you won't after you watch this video!  Just think:  affect is usually a verb, meaning to act on; and effect is usually a noun, meaning a result.\nExceptions: when affect is a noun (hardly ever) and when effect is a verb (hardly ever).  We'll see lots of examples and even see a special effect (with an e). \n\nYou may also enjoy our video on That vs Which:\nhttp://bit.ly/2nilvgK\n\nHave you tried grammarly?

      "description": "Prepositions show relationships. They help you place nouns in context.  For instance, prepositions are used to make clear where a noun is:  \"The dog is ON my bed.\" \"The milk is IN the refrigerator.\" Prepositions can be used to show time: \"The meeting is AT four-o'clock.\"  \"I drink coffee BEFORE brushing my teeth.\" They can give you a sense of direction: \"She is walking TOWARDS her friends.\" \"The monster ran AWAY from Victor Frankenstein.\" Prepositions can tell you where a noun came from: \"The tea came FROM South Africa.\"  \"He took the sweater OUT OF the closet.\"\n\nThis video helps you understand the proper usage of prepositions, and about how prepositional phrases can act as adjectives or adverbs.  It also addresses that funny superstition in English grammar - ending a sentence with a preposition is perfectly fine! \n\nYou have great ideas. But no one will know about them if you can't communicate effectively! Our series of Basic English Grammar Rules will help you brush up your language skills.

And division has changed from version 2.  Now, division always returns the correct math value as a float.  It no longer returns the quotient when you divide two whole numbers.\n\nAnd beware of division by 0!\n\nTo learn Python, start our Python Playlist HERE:\nhttp://bit.ly/PythonHelloWorld\n\nSubscribe to Socratica: http://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend:\nPython Cookbook, Third edition from O\u2019Reilly\nhttp://amzn.to/2sCNYlZ\n\nThe Mythical Man Month - Essays on Software Engineering & Project Management\nhttp://amzn.to/2tYdNeP\n\nShop Amazon Used Textbooks - Save up to 90%\nhttp://amzn.to/2pllk4B\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nPython instructor: Ulka Simone Mohanty\nWritten & Produced by Michael Harrison\nFX by Andriy Kostyuk\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

The group of permutations on a set of n-elements is denoted S_n.\n\nSymmetric groups capture the history of abstract algebra, provide a wide range of examples in group theory, are useful when writing software to study abstract algebra, and every finite group can be represented as a subgroup of a symmetric group.

This means if you know two of the sides, you can solve a basic equation to find the length of the third side.\n\nWhen studying the Pythagorean Theorem, it is common to see examples where all 3 sides are integers.  These are called \"Pythagorean Triples\", and there are an infinite number of these triangles.\n\nThe Pythagorean Theorem only works for right triangles.  For acute or obtuse triangles, you need to use a more general formula: the law of cosines.\n\nTo learn more Geometry, you can watch our playlist from the beginning: \nhttps://bit.ly/GeometrySocratica\n\nYou might also like our videos about How to Be a Great Student!\nhttp://bit.ly/StudyTipsPlaylist\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nGeometer: Louise McCartney\nArtwork: Kelly Vivanco\nWritten by Michael Harrison\nDirected & Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison & Michael Harrison\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

(Astronomy)\nStars are not eternal and unchanging - they are born, live their lives, and then die.  The way a star dies depends on its mass.  A low mass star ends as a white dwarf.  A high mass star becomes a black hole.  But in between, a star becomes a neutron star.\n\nIn this video we talk about which stars become neutron stars, and the physics behind their formation.\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction \n0:38 Hydrogen fusion to form Helium, etc.\n1:15 The fates of stars (stellar evolution)\n3:12  Quantifying in terms of stellar masses\n4:21  What's in a neutron star\n\nWe'd love it if you'd share our video on Socials. \nBe sure to tag Socratica so we can come say hi! \n  \u2737 Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\n  \u2737 Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\n  \u2737 Twitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 SUPPORT SOCRATICA\nYou can support our channel by making purchases using our affiliate links.

It wasn't until 1781, during the Age of Enlightenment, that Uranus was discovered.\n\nThis remarkable discovery was made by the German-English astronomer William Herschel, who worked with his sister Caroline. By grinding and polishing their own lenses and mirrors, they were able to construct their own telescopes to make their discoveries. Uranus had been previously catalogued as a faint star. With their superior instrument, however, the Herschels could see this fuzzy heavenly body more clearly. They initially thought Uranus was a comet, because it was changing position. \n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction - 6 planets known until 1781\n0:33 Personal history of Herschel\n1:26 The discovery\n2:20 Naming the new planet\n2:50 Later life and work\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CONNECT WITH US\nWe hope you will share our videos on social media\u2014that really helps us grow.

Covalent Bonds involve the sharing of valence electrons. Ionic Bonds and Covalent bonds are both considered STRONG intramolecular forces. But do you know which is stronger?  You'd think this was a straightforward question. But there's more to it! \nEach of these bonds has a range of strengths.  In this video, we'll discuss how the strength of Ionic Bonds and Covalent bonds are measured so you can compare two chemical bonds. \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS\n0:00  Intramolecular Forces\n0:25  Definitions of ionic and covalent bonds\n1:45  Measuring the strength of ionic bonds (lattice energy)\n3:08  Some typical lattice energies of ionic bonds\n3:50  Measuring the strength of covalent bonds (bond enthalpy)\n4:19  Some typical bond enthalpies of covalent bonds\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

In sum, Aristotle\u2019s work comprised the first systematic form of Western Philosophy. Aristotle is also considered the first genuine scientist in history. \n\nAs Isaac Newton said, \"If I have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.\" Our Great Thinkers playlist celebrates influential thinkers who have changed the world for the better.\n\nBe sure to subscribe so you don't miss videos from Socratica!\nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nHost: Liliana de Castro\nArtwork:  Kim Parkhurst\nDirected by Michael Harrison \nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nCreative Commons Picture Credits:\nTheophrastus\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Teofrasto_Orto_botanico_detail.jpg\nAuthor: Teofrasto_Orto_botanico_PA.jpg: tato grasso\n\nGreek Map \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Greece_location_map.svg\nAuthor: Lencer\n\nBeginning of book 7 of Aristotle's Metaphysics, translated into latin by William of Moerbeke. 14th century manuscript.\nhttp://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ficheiro:Meta-moerbeke_jpeg031-part.jpg\nAuthor: Peter Damian\n\nRain\nhttp://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%95%E3%82%A1%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB:22_Regen_ubt.jpeg\nAuthor: Tomasz Sienicki\n\nAtlantic Ocean\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Clouds_over_the_Atlantic_Ocean.jpg\nAuthor: Tiago Fioreze",

Without it, chemistry would be a chaotic, confusing jumble of seemingly random observations.  What makes the periodic table really invaluable is its use as a predictive tool. You can predict a lot about the chemical behavior of an element if you know where it is on the periodic table. \n\nWe give credit to Dmitri Mendeleev for the first Periodic Table. He organized the elements in his table in order of atomic mass. Henry Moseley modified the table, ordering the elements in terms of atomic number. This is the periodic table we use today. \n\nBREAKING NEWS: The Periodic Table now has a FULL SEVENTH ROW!

It\u2019s sort of like bookkeeping. Stoichiometry lets you figure out how much of a substance is used up or produced in a chemical reaction. It\u2019s really common to measure the amount of one reactant, in order to figure out how much product you expect to get. Or, given how much of one reactant you have, you might want to figure out how much of a second reactant to add so you don\u2019t have any left over.  \n\nThis video introduces the concept of stoichiometry, and how balanced chemical equations can be used like recipes (for instance, the recipe for grilled cheese sandwiches). We give an example of how to solve mole-to-mole problems.  Part II will cover mass-to-mass problems. \n\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00  What is Stoichiometry\n1:39  You use stoichiometry when you make grilled cheese sandwiches\n5:18  Example 1: a problem involving MOLES\n\nWatch Stoichiometry Part 2 for conversions with MOLES and GRAMS: \nhttps://www.socratica.com/lesson/stoichiometry-mass-to-mass-conversions\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

We will cover those problems in another video! \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00  What is Stoichiometry (review)\n0:37  Intro to working stoichiometry problems with MASS\n0:53  Example 2:  A problem involving MOLES and GRAMS\n\nWhat to Watch Next:\nDid you see Stoichiometry part 1? http://bit.ly/1NSCApt\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders. She continued her studies in Molecular Biology (focusing on Immunology and Neurobiology) at Princeton University, where she began teaching as a graduate student. Her success in teaching convinced her to leave the glamorous world of biology research and turn to teaching full-time, accepting a position at an exclusive prep school, where she taught biology and chemistry for eight years. Kimberly co-founded Socratica Studios.\n\n\u2b22\u2b22\u2b22\nCreative Commons Picture Credits:\nChemical reaction (combustion of methane)\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Combustion_reaction_of_methane.jpg\nAuthor: Jynto\n\n#Chemistry #Stoichiometry #educationalvideo",

Although he chose to list it first, Kepler only came to this conclusion after figuring out his \"second\" law, which says that if you draw a line from the Sun to Mars, and wait a fixed amount of time, that line will sweep out a certain area as Mars moves along its orbit.  This finding was generalized to include all planets in 1621.\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction - Kepler and Tycho Brahe\n0:50 The first law came after the second!\n1:02 Visualizing the Second Law\n2:40 Connection with Conservation of Angular Momentum\n\nWe have videos for all 3 laws! \nKepler's 1st Law: http://bit.ly/1XCVRSQ\nKepler's 2nd Law:http://bit.ly/1lzhLVQ\nKepler's 3rd Law: http://bit.ly/1MZ35bR\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CONNECT WITH US\nWe hope you will share our videos on social media\u2014that really helps us grow.

What do we use this for?  \n\npH is a way to measure the relative strengths of acids and bases. We start this video with a quick review of the definition of acid and base, consider whether water is an acid or a base, and then work 3 examples of using the equation for pH.  It's a base 10 logarithmic scale, where something with pH 5 is 10 times more acidic than something with pH 6. pH7 is neutral, and anything with a pH greater than 7 is considered basic (or alkaline), and anything with a pH less than 7 is considered acidic. Make sure to watch to the end so you can see the surprising pH of some of our everyday liquids! \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00  What is pH?\n0:12  Arrhenius definition of an acid - aqueous solutions\n1:19  The pH scale\n0:42  Bronsted-Lowry definition - doesn't have to be aqueous\n1:45  The equation to calculate pH\n2:11  Is water an acid or a base?\n3:43  The pH scale (0-14)\n4:47  pH is a negative logarithmic scale\n5:29 Example 1 - lemon juice\n6:37 Example 2 - laundry detergent\n7:34 Example 3 - soda\n8:04  The pH of common liquids\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\nProducts in this video:\nLitmus pH Test Strips, Universal Application (pH 1-14), 2 Packs of 100 Strips - http://amzn.to/2fM8rLo\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

      "description": "Massachusetts, nicknamed \"The Bay State,\" became the 6th state on February 6th, 1788. It is a state rich in history - the site of many key events in the Revolutionary War. Massachusetts is home to more than 180 colleges and institutions of higher learning (including Harvard, oldest in the nation). Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Island are also popular tourist destinations for the scenic shoreline and delicious seafood. \n\nOur series of US geography videos \"Visit the 50 States,\" gives you a little history and interesting facts about each state.  For every state, you'll learn when it entered the Union, what's its motto, how did it get its nickname, and see what the flag, seal, and state capitol building all look like. We'll find the state capital on the map!  There's also fun trivia - do you know the state tree, flower, and bird?

They have such immense gravity that anything close by is sucked in, never to escape. Even LIGHT!  That's why we call them BLACK HOLES. \n\nSome black holes are small. Some are HUGE! There are stellar black holes, about the size of a dozen of our suns. Then there are SUPERMASSIVE black holes, that are the size of MILLIONS and MILLIONS of our suns! Scientists think there are supermassive black holes in the center of each galaxy. The supermassive black hole in the center of our Milky Way galaxy is called Sagittarius A. Recently, the Event Horizon Telescope was able to image the supermassive black hole in the center of the distant galaxy Messier 87. This black hole is known as M87, and was the first black hole ever to be imaged using the giant radio telescope EHT.\n\nIn this video, we talk about how Black Holes are formed and how we can detect them using various methods. \n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:03  History of Black Holes\n1:49  Theory of Relativity by Einstein - Spacetime\n3:12  Are black holes real?\n3:48  Finding black holes\n4:13  Binary Stars\n4:54  Schwarzschild Radius and the Event Horizon\n5:24  Finding the mass of a black hole\n5:56  Stellar and supermassive black holes\n6:44  Angular momentum\n7:37  The Ergosphere\n8:09  Electric Charge of a black hole\n8:42  No Hair Theorem\n9:04  Inside a black hole\n10:09  Current research topics\n\nIf you're looking for a video to explain Black Holes to kids, we recommend this excellent video from Socratica Kids: http://bit.ly/BlackHoles4Kids\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CONNECT WITH US\nWe hope you will share our videos on social media\u2014that really helps us grow.

      "description": "Michigan became the 26th US State on January 26, 1837.  This state is known for its extensive nature preserves, including the largest dedicated state forest system in the nation. Michigan is  also a great place for water sports - it borders 4 of the 5 Great Lakes, and has more than 11,000 inland lakes and more than 36,000 miles of streams. Only Alaska has more shoreline. \n\nOur series of US geography videos \"Visit the 50 States,\" gives you a little history and interesting facts about each state.  For every state, you'll learn when it entered the Union, what's its motto, how did it get its nickname, and see what the flag, seal, and state capitol building all look like. We'll find the state capital on the map!  There's also fun trivia - do you know the state tree, flower, and bird?

For instance, just because water is made up of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms, that doesn't mean you can say water is 33% oxygen and 67% hydrogen. To determine percent composition by mass, you need to refer to a Periodic Table so you can see what each kind of atom weighs.  With a little math, you'll be able to see that water is 88.81% oxygen by mass, and 11.19% hydrogen by mass.   In this video, we work through two examples in full.  \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:40 Definition of percent composition\n1:11 Example 1: What is the percent composition of water - H2O\n3:25 Example 2: What is the percent composition of glucose - C6H12O6\n\nDo you need to understand Empirical Formulas?\n  https://www.socratica.com/lesson/empirical-formula\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

The kernel is the set of all elements in G which map to the identity element in H.  It is a subgroup in G and it depends on f.  Different homomorphisms between G and H can give different kernels.\n\nIf f is an isomorphism, then the kernel will simply be the identity element.\n\nYou can also define a kernel for a homomorphism between other objects in abstract algebra: rings, fields, vector spaces, modules.

      "description": "2008 Chemistry AP Released Exam\nMultiple Choice Questions 1-3 Answers and Explanations\n\nThis is a review of multiple choice questions 1-3 from the Chemistry AP Exam most recently released to the public.  We interpret each question, explain the correct answer, and discuss why you might be tempted by some of the other answer options. Note that this is not the entire test but a small sample. This is a transformative use of this material and is considered Fair Use. \n\nQuestions 1-3 deal with elements in the periodic table that are the following groups:  Noble gases, Alkali metals, Halogens, Transition elements, and Actinides. You will need to be able to recognize where these reside in the periodic table and what their characteristics are in order to answer these questions. \n\nYou can jump to each question here:\n0:11  Question 1\n1:06  Question 2\n1:37  Question 3\n\nReady for the next video?

      "description": "Do you take notes in class? Are they actually helpful for you? Let's learn about the CORNELL METHOD of note-taking.  This is a great method for taking notes in class (or from your textbook, or watching a video).  There's no way to remember every word of a lecture. But taking great lecture notes is the first step to getting good grades and being a great student. \n\nThe most important rule is don't write down every word.  Listen carefully, then write simplified and abbreviated phrases that capture the main ideas. \n\nWhen you get home, RE-READ your notes!  Proofread them, making corrections as needed before you forget.  Check your notes with a friend! In the margin, write brief headers that will cue your memory of each section of your notes. \n\nFinally, write a summary at the bottom of the page so you can quickly tell what this page of notes is all about. \n\nDo you have a different method of taking notes?

(Astronomy)\nWhite dwarfs are dead stars that continue to glow because of heat, not nuclear fusion.  Most stars in our universe will end up as a white dwarf star.  Join us to learn how white dwarfs are made, what they\u2019re like, how long they\u2019ll shine, and how astronomers detect them.\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction - Life cycle of stars\n0:50 Fusion in stars and Stellar Evolution\n1:40 Creation of a White Dwarf\n2:20 Black Dwarf\n2:40 Chandrasekhar Limit\n3:00 Pauli Exclusion Principle and Degenerate Electron Pressure\n3:30 Looking for White Dwarfs\n3:55 Helium shell flash, Thermal pulse\n4:30 Planetary Nebula (Herschel)\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CONNECT WITH US\nWe hope you will share our videos on social media\u2014that really helps us grow.

When you collect data, whether you\u2019re doing Chemistry, Biology, Physics, or Engineering, you need to notice how precise your tools allow you to be.  There should be one estimated digit in your data. \n\nThis is where the idea of significant figures comes from - from measurement!  Make a note of how precise your data is before you start calculating.  Then you round off to the correct number of significant digits at the end of your calculations.  Otherwise, you give people the wrong idea of how precise your initial measurements were. \n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll go over all the rules for determining significant figures.  We also do examples of sig figs in calculations! We show you the rules for adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing.  We even cover the advanced topics of significant figures in logarithms and when you raise 10 to a power. \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro\n0:29  Quick examples of significant figures\n1:19  Where does the idea of sig figs come from?\n2:30  RULE 1\n2:54  RULE 2\n4:22  RULE 3\n4:58  RULE 4\n6:40  Adding and Subtracting Significant Figures\n7:30  Multiplying and Dividing Significant Figures\n8:14  Logarithms and 10^x with Significant Figures\n9:31  Super Useful TIP! \n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders. She continued her studies in Molecular Biology (focusing on Immunology and Neurobiology) at Princeton University, where she began teaching as a graduate student. Her success in teaching convinced her to leave the glamorous world of biology research and turn to teaching full-time, accepting a position at an exclusive prep school, where she taught biology and chemistry for eight years.

We discuss the 3 types of Conjunctions:\nCoordinating (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so)\nSubordinating (because, before, after, although, since, unless, until\u2026)\nCorrelative (either/or; neither/nor; both/and\u2026)\n\nYou have great ideas. But no one will know about them if you can't communicate effectively! Our series of Basic English Grammar Rules will help you brush up your language skills.

We interpret each question, explain the correct answer, and discuss why you might be tempted by some of the other answer options. Note that this is not the entire test but a small sample. This is a transformative use of this material and is considered Fair Use. \n\nQuestions 7-9 involve understanding the differences between 5 gases.  They differ in their molecular weights, their geometries, and in their electrolytic behavior.  In this video, you will use a periodic table to calculate molecular weights. Special vocabulary used includes \"effuse\" (effusion) and VSEPR theory.  \n\nYou can jump to each question here:\n0:10  Question 7\n1:08  Question 8\n1:31  Question 9\n\nClick here to start the practice multiple choice playlist: \nhttp://bit.ly/2cGbm7r\n\nWhen it comes time to prepare for an AP exam, the SAT, or for any big final, it's a good idea to practice with multiple choice questions.  Make sure you follow up on the questions you miss!  Look up any words you don't recognize, and make flash cards to make sure you know all the vocabulary. \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nOur Periodic Table app is FREE in the Google Play store! \nhttp://goo.gl/yg9mAF\n\nDon't miss our other chemistry videos:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQw9G...\n\nPlease Subscribe so you'll hear about our newest videos!\nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend the following books:\n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n13th edition: http://amzn.to/2n5SXtB\n14th edition: http://amzn.to/2mHk79f\n\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  http://amzn.to/2mO2khf\n\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  http://amzn.to/2nlaJp0\n\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  http://amzn.to/2lJZzO3\n\nProducts in this video:\nCracking the AP Chemistry Exam, 2017 Edition: Proven Techniques to Help You Score a 5 (College Test Preparation) - http://amzn.to/2dybh7u\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

      "description": "When should we use Me, Myself, and I?  Don\u2019t they all mean the same thing?  NO!  \nYou don\u2019t have to be confused anymore.  This video makes the difference between these three words perfectly clear! \n\nI is a subject pronoun.  You use it when you are doing an action.\nMe is an object pronoun.  You use it when an action is being done to you. \nMyself is a very special kind of word - a reflexive pronoun.  ONLY use this word when you are doing an action to yourself.  Okay, there\u2019s one other way you can use it - as an intensifying pronoun. Example:  \u201cI did it all myself.\u201d  But otherwise, don\u2019t use this word instead of me or I! \n\nDo you know when to use me, myself & I?  You will after watching this video! \n\nYou may also enjoy Who vs Whom: http://bit.ly/2mCpkAi\nYou have great ideas. But no one will know about them if you can't communicate effectively! Our series of Basic English Grammar Rules will help you brush up your language skills. People will pay attention to you ideas - not your grammar mistakes.

In this video, we give you a quick overview of calculus and introduce the limit, derivative and integral.\n\nWe begin with the question \u201cWho invented Calculus?\u201d  Next, we talk about the two main tools you\u2019ll study: derivatives and integrals.  To understand both of these you\u2019ll first learn about limits.  After you learn how to compute the derivative and integral for basic functions and apply them to real-world problems, you\u2019ll move up to higher dimensions and study things like \u201cpartial derivatives\u201d and \u201cmultiple integrals.\u201d\n\nWhat to watch next:\nThe Tangent Line & the Derivative\nhttp://bit.ly/TangentDerivative\n\nProduct Rule for Derivatives\nhttp://bit.ly/ProductRule\n\nQuotient Rule\nhttp://bit.ly/QuotientRuleDer\n\nHow to Study For a Test\nhttp://bit.ly/Study4Test\n\nHow to Study Physics\nhttp://bit.ly/StudyTipsPhysics\n\nHow to Study Programming\nhttp://bit.ly/Learn_Programming\n\nBe sure to subscribe so you don't miss videos from Socratica!\nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nWe recommend the following books:\nHow to Be a Great Student\nebook: https://amzn.to/2Lh3XSP\nPaperback: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\nKindle Unlimited: https://amzn.to/3atr8TJ\n\nInnumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences\nhttp://amzn.to/2ri1nf7\n\nThe Art of Learning by Josh Waitzkin (Chess Prodigy)\nhttp://amzn.to/2r952QB\n\nShop Amazon Used Textbooks - Save up to 90%\nhttp://amzn.to/2pllk4B\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWritten and Produced by Michael Harrison\n\nMichael Harrison received his BS in math from Caltech, and his MS from the University of Washington where he studied algebraic number theory.

      "description": "How do we get our work done? We use the POMODORO TECHNIQUE.  This is a great method for managing your time. It involves breaking your tasks into 25 minute chunks, then taking a 5 minute break, and then doing another cycle.  Repeat until you're done!  \n\nIt's amazing how much more efficient you will be when using this time management technique. This is the right way to do multitasking - staying VERY focused on one task at a time.  \n\nThe Pomodoro Technique was invented by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.  He used a little Tomato-shaped timer, and that's where the name came from! You can get one here:\nhttp://amzn.to/2pMQhyA\n\nThis technique is especially powerful when combined with using a PLANNER. \nHow to Use a Planner for Time Management: http://bit.ly/Planner_Tips\n\nDo you have a different method of managing all your study tasks?

When you see a chemical equation in a textbook, it looks like the reactants are completely used up and all made into product.  \n\nBut in the real world, you usually have some of one or more reactants left over.  The reagent that is used up first is known as the \u201cLimiting Reagent\u201d (also known as the \u201cLimiting Reactant.\u201d)\nThis is especially important if you are working with a very expensive chemical that you can't afford to waste. \n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll work through several examples in full.

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends!  We're here to help you be a Great Student. \nIn this episode, we learn about the best way to use FLASH CARDS.  \n\nFlash cards are a great tool to use anytime you need to memorize facts, fast.  They're great for drilling vocabulary terms, learning dates in history...so many uses. The best thing about flash cards is that they help you figure out what you know, and what you don\u2019t know.  And although this may be uncomfortable, the best way to master a subject is to focus on what you DON\u2019T know! \n\nIn this video, we'll show you how we use flash cards, using an important technique known as \"spaced repetition.\"  Basically, don't try to cram in all your studying in one go!  Make sure you break it up over a couple of days at least, with breaks in between. Try using flashcards following the Pomodoro method! Two fantastic techniques working together to help you be a Great Student. \n\nWe recommend making flashcards the old fashioned way - with pen and paper, but if you'd like to use an app on your phone, we like Anki. Do you have a different method of studying with flash cards?

      "description": "In calculus, you\u2019ll often hear \u201cThe derivative is the slope of the tangent line.\u201d  But what is a tangent line?  The definition is trickier than you might think.\n\nTangent lines are important because they are the best way to approximate a curve using a line.  We can then use the slope of the line as a way to measure the \u201cslope\u201d of the curve.\n\nBe sure to subscribe so you don't miss videos from Socratica!\nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWritten and Produced by Michael Harrison\n\nMichael Harrison received his BS in math from Caltech, and his MS from the University of Washington where he studied algebraic number theory.

      "description": "DNA is a double-helix - it looks like a twisted ladder.  Its backbone is made of sugars (deoxyribose) and phosphate groups, and the rungs of the ladder are made from 4 nitrogenous bases: Guanine, Adenine, Thymine, and Cytosine.  The order of the \u201crungs,\u201d or bases, is what determines what the DNA is coding for.  Think of it like the order of letters in a word, and the order of words in a sentence.  Except in the language of DNA, there are only 4 letters. \n\nIn this video, we discuss the structure of DNA - how big is it, how are the components attached to each other, and what is the spacing between the rungs.  We\u2019ll also learn about the major groove and minor groove, and other important details about DNA structure. \n\nOur series on Biology is aimed at the first-year college level, including pre-med students. These videos should also be helpful for students in challenging high school biology courses.  Perfect for preparing for the AP Biology exam or the Biology SAT. Also appropriate for advanced homeschoolers.

      "description": "Join the club: https://snu.socratica.com/join for updates & monthly newsletter\nWhat is Biochemistry, and what do biochemists study? What is covered in this field, as opposed to Molecular Biology or Cell Biology? The truth is, there\u2019s a lot of overlap in these disciplines.  But in general, biochemistry is the study of the chemistry of life.  \n\nWhat\u2019s so special about the molecules of life? It\u2019s a case of emergent properties. When biochemical molecules interact, unexpected complexities arise! Phospholipids form the bilayers found in cells. These compartments allow for high concentrations of chemical reactions to take place, leading to...life. \n\nThe four main types of biological molecules studied by biochemists are proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. This video briefly introduces these topics, and each one will be covered in more depth in their own videos. \n\nOur series on Biology is aimed at the first-year college level, including pre-med students.

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends!  We're here to help you be a Great Student. \nIn this episode, we learn about MNEMONICS.  This is another word for memory aids - tools you can use to improve your memory and recall.  This is one of the most important aspects of being a great student - remembering what you are trying to learn! \n\nOne of the first mnemonics was the \u201cmethod of loci,\u201d also known as the \u201cMind Palace.\u201d This involves associating what you want to remember with a particular place (or a pathway). \n\nOther mnemonic devices include making acronyms, or making sentences out of the first letters of the words you need to memorize. \n\nDo you have a favourite mnemonic device you\u2019ve found especially helpful?

How about your tap water? We\u2019re testing the pH of 10 Common Household Liquids using a digital pH meter. \n\nPure water is neutral, with a pH of 7, but most other water-based solutions are either acidic or basic. Some people are afraid of the word \u201cacid,\u201d thinking it means they are going to get burned. But the words \u201cacid\u201d and \u201cbase\u201d merely tell you the direction a solution is moving away from neutral.  \n\nAcids increase the concentration of H+ ions in a solution. \nBases decrease the concentration of H+ ions in a solution. \nIf you\u2019re concerned about safety, what you really want to know is the pH.  \nThe pH scale runs from 0 to 14.  \nAcids have a pH less than 7. \nBases have a pH greater than 7. \nThe farther you are from 7, the stronger the acid or base is.\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 Introduction about acids and bases\n1:46  pH equation\n2:52  Tap Water\n3:25  Coffee\n4:00  Glass Cleaner\n4:44  Soda Pop\n5:14  Moisturizer\n5:47  Vinegar\n6:16  Sriracha (hot sauce)\n6:49  Shampoo\n7:50  Milk\n8:36  Lemon Juice\n9:25  Challenge\n\nSocratica sends a big thank you to Rozway for sending us their digital pH meter to use in this video!

      "description": "CHNOPS stands for Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur. These six elements make up 98% of living matter on Earth! How does that help you? If you understand the chemical behavior of CHNOPS, you can understand almost all of biochemistry.  \n\nAP Hint! Every year, CHNOPS is the answer to a question on the Biology AP. :)\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll take a closer look at these key elements and discuss where you will see them in living things. \n\nJump to:\n\n0:46  Carbon\n1:51  Hydrogen\n2:34  Nitrogen\n3:04  Oxygen\n3:36  Phosphorus\n4:15  Sulfur\n4:43  Calcium \n5:16  Trace Elements\n\nWe challenge you to name a biological molecule made only of CHNOPS or a subset of these elements. Write your answer in the comments! \n\nOur series on Biology is aimed at the first-year college level, including pre-med students. These videos should also be helpful for students in challenging high school biology courses.  Perfect for preparing for the AP Biology exam or the Biology SAT. Also appropriate for advanced homeschoolers.

Our host Liliana speaks English, Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian - and she\u2019s agreed to share some of her top tips for learning a second language. We discuss the importance of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary, and include tips for conquering each of these important areas. \nWe also try out an online language learning site, Lingoda. This is a great way to be able to learn using immersion without having to travel to another country! Immersion is when you ONLY speak your new language, without any English interruptions.   \n\nDon't forget - these tips and tricks also work if you are learning English as a Second Language!

      "description": "Do you know the difference between clauses and phrases?  They are commonly confused parts of speech! Independent Clauses, Dependent Clauses, and Phrases are all groups of words. But only one of these can stand on its own as a sentence! Let\u2019s talk about the different types of clauses and phrases and tease out the difference. \n\nYou can use these links to jump to the different kinds of clauses and phrases:\n\n0:03  Independent Clauses - stand on their own as sentences\n0:33  Dependent Clauses - can\u2019t stand on their own\n1:15  Adjective Clause - acts like an adjective\n1:44  Adverb Clause - acts like an adverb\n2:04  Noun Clause - acts like a noun\n2:38  Phrases - also can\u2019t stand on their own\n3:26  Quiz + Challenge for comments\n\nYou have great ideas. But no one will know about them if you can't communicate effectively! Our series of Basic English Grammar Rules will help you brush up your language skills. People will pay attention to you ideas - not your grammar mistakes. Feel more confident about the SAT and the ACT.

      "description": "In biological molecules, the carbon skeleton determines their general 3D shape. But what\u2019s on the surface of the molecules determines their chemical behavior. Small chemical species, hanging off the exterior of these molecules, bump into each other and react. These are known as FUNCTIONAL GROUPS.\n\nTo understand what kinds of chemical reactions biological molecules can do, you have to understand the chemical behavior of the functional groups on the surface of the molecule. \n\nIn this video we\u2019ll look at the following functional groups (click on the time stamp to jump to that part of the video):\n1:29  Hydroxyl Group  -OH\n2:02  Carbonyl Group =CO (aldehydes and ketones)\n2:37  Carboxyl Group -COOH\n3:00  Amine Group -NH2\n3:18  Phosphate Group PO4 3-\n4:08  Sulfhydryl Group -SH\n4:31  Methyl Group -CH3\n\nSUBSCRIBE if you want to be notified of our next video!\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nOur series on Biology is aimed at the first-year college level, including pre-med students. These videos should also be helpful for students in challenging high school biology courses.    Perfect for preparing for the AP Biology exam or the Biology SAT.

We're here to help you be a Great Student. One of the greatest students of all time was also one of the greatest teachers of all time - Richard Feynman.  He was a Nobel-winning physicist, who was legendary for being able to reach even complete novices with his clear, jargon-free explanations. Feynman knew a lot about how to help students learn, because he himself was insatiably curious, and never stopped learning. \n\nThe Feynman Technique is named after this extraordinary thinker.  It\u2019s a way to test yourself as you study - do you REALLY understand something?  Or are you just repeating what you read in a textbook or heard in class? This is one of the most important study tips to learn about being a great student, whether you are in high school, college, grad school, or you are learning on your own.  \n\nAfter you watch the video, try our Feynman Technique Challenge - pick something complicated you are studying, and try to explain it to us in the comments.  USE THE FEYNMAN TECHNIQUE!

      "description": "All gerunds end in -ING, but not all words that end in -ING are gerunds!  A gerund is a noun you make from a verb by adding -ING. But how do you tell a gerund from a Present Participle?  You form a present participle from a verb by adding the ending -ING, just like how you make a gerund. But rather than acting as a noun, a present participle usually acts like a verb tense.  \n\nWatch for lots of examples to make these parts of speech clear and understandable! You\u2019ll be able to say what is a gerund, what is a present participle, and create your own with ease. \n\nYou have great ideas. But no one will know about them if you can't communicate effectively! Our series of Basic English Grammar Rules will help you brush up your language skills. People will pay attention to you ideas - not your grammar mistakes. Feel more confident about the SAT and the ACT. Great for homeschooling, English as a Second Language (ESL) and studying for the TOEFL, too!\n\nClick to watch more grammar lessons:\nhttp://bit.ly/1LnJ1CN\n\nDon't forget to Subscribe so you'll hear about our newest videos!\nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe Recommend:\nStrunk and White (short and a classic)\nhttp://amzn.to/2nR1UqC\n\nEats, Shoots & Leaves (funny!

      "description": "There are four types of chemical bonds essential for life to exist:  Ionic Bonds, Covalent Bonds, Hydrogen Bonds, and van der Waals interactions.  We need all of these different kinds of bonds to play various roles in biochemical interactions.\n\nThese bonds vary in their strengths. In Chemistry, we think of Ionic Bonds and Covalent bonds as having an overlapping range of strengths. But remember, in biochemistry, everything is happening in the context of water. This means Ionic bonds tend to dissociate in water.  Thus, we will think of these bonds in the following order (strongest to weakest): Covalent, Ionic, Hydrogen, and van der Waals.  Also note that in Chemistry, the weakest bonds are more commonly referred to as \u201cdispersion forces.\u201d \n\nRelated Chemistry video:\nIonic Bonds vs Covalent Bonds\nhttp://bit.ly/2cUG6C8\n\nSUBSCRIBE if you want to be notified of our next video!\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nOur series on Biology is aimed at the first-year college level, including pre-med students.

In a previous video, we found the Empirical Formula, and this is a related idea, but not the same thing. The Empirical Formula gives the lowest whole number ratio of the atoms of the elements in a compound. In this video, we show you how to calculate the molecular formula given the Empirical Formula and the Molar Mass.

      "description": "Why is water essential for Life to exist on Earth? We are about 60% water - and there are some organisms that are as much as 90% water!  What is so important about water? How does it support life?  \n\nIn this video, we discuss the special properties of water that make it the \u201cSolvent of Life.\u201d  Chief among these properties is the extensive Hydrogen Bonding between water molecules that make water an extremely cohesive liquid (the molecules stick together).  Due to the extensive hydrogen bonding, water has some emergent properties that impact life on Earth in many ways.  These include:\nCohesion\nAdhesion\nHigh surface tension\nHigh specific heat\nHigh heat of vaporization\nIce Floats (Ice is less dense as a solid than liquid water)\n\nFor each of these properties, we discuss how they impact living creatures on Earth. \n\nSUBSCRIBE if you want to be notified of our next video!\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nOur series on Biology is aimed at the first-year college level, including pre-med students. These videos should also be helpful for students in challenging high school biology courses.  Perfect for preparing for the AP Biology exam or the Biology SAT.

She then continued her studies in Molecular Biology (focusing on Immunology and Neurobiology) at Princeton University, where she began teaching as a graduate student. Her success in teaching convinced her to leave the glamorous world of biology research and turn to teaching full-time, accepting a position at an exclusive prep school, where she taught biology and chemistry for eight years. She is now the head writer and producer of Socratica Studios.\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nCreative Commons Picture Credits\n\nBasilisk running on water\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Basiliscus_basiliscus_running_on_water_-_pone.0037300.s001.ogv\nAuthor: Minetti et al.\n\nxylem\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0089934\nAuthor: Boutilier et al 2014 PLOS\n\nMeniscus\nhttp://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050320\nAuthor: Jingmin et al 2012 PLOS\n\nLittle girl drinking\nhttps://pixabay.com/en/girl-thirsty-drink-fountain-water-2241750/\nAuthor: brisch27\n\nArmy scout drinking\nhttps://pixabay.com/en/girl-scout-army-thirsty-sensuality-932421/\nAuthor: AdinaVoicu\n \n\nWater drop Macro View\nhttp://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=173836&picture=water-drop-macro-view\nAuthor: JeanBeauford\n\nWoman in the Ocean\nhttp://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=172525&picture=woman-in-the-ocean\nAuthor: JeanBeauford\n\nWater on fabric\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Water_droplet_lying_on_a_damask.jpg\nAuthor: Petar Milosevic\nWater strider \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WaterstriderEnWiki.jpg\nAuthor: PD\n\nPolar bear on ice\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Polar_Bear_AdF.jpg\nAuthor: Arturo de Frias Marques\n\nPenguins on ice\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pygoscelis_antarctica_trying_to_get_to_iceberg.wmv.ogv\nAuthor: Brocken Inaglory\n\nCells (colourized) \nhttps://pixabay.com/en/white-blood-cell-cell-blood-cell-543471\nAuthor: skeeze\n\nHydrogen bonds in water\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3D_model_hydrogen_bonds_in_water.svg\nAuthor: Qwerter\n\nWater strider footage\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Vesimittareita.ogv\nAuthor: Uusijani\n\nroadrunner\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Greater_Roadrunner_Walking.jpg\nAuthor: Jessie Eastland\n\nPartially frozen pond\nhttp://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=15079&picture=partially-frozen-pond\nAuthor: David Wagner",

How to Be a Great Student\nebook: https://amzn.to/2Lh3XSP    Paperback: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\nor read for free when you sign up for Kindle Unlimited: https://amzn.to/3atr8TJ\nHello Socratica Friends! We\u2019re here to help you be a Great Student!  Wouldn\u2019t you like to be able to read faster, and understand everything you read? Doesn\u2019t SPEED READING sound like a great idea? It is possible to read faster, but you shouldn\u2019t expect miracles.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll talk about what it would take to actually read faster. Reading is more than just flashing words in front of your eyes. There are several steps involved, and some of them may be easier to speed up than others. We'll investigate some of the more popular speed reading techniques.\n\nFor example, we discuss how you get better with practice at training your eyes to follow a line of text. Your eyes don\u2019t follow each word smoothly, but rather jump across the page (these jumps are called eye saccades). Some methods of speed reading focus on shortening the time spent on each saccade. \n\nOther techniques tell you to minimize the amount of \u201creading to yourself,\u201d or \u201csubvocalization\u201d that you do, because it takes longer to speak a word than to read it. Is it possible to stop subvocalization? We discuss this idea. \n\nThen  there is also the time spent recognizing each word. The better your working vocabulary is, the faster you will be at understanding what each word represents in the context of what you are reading. \n\nHere's a quick speed reading test you can try. How did you do? Let us know in the comments!\nhttp://www.freereadingtest.com/\n\nWe are so thankful for the support of our generous patrons.  We are very happy to dedicate this video to them!

      "description": "Our Socratica Astronomy series is back!  Bookmark the playlist here:\n  \u2737 https://socratica.link/Astro_Playlist\nWe also ask you join our STELLAR email list so we can notify you when new videos go live: \n  \u2737 https://snu.socratica.com/astronomy\n(Don\u2019t rely on the YT algorithm to show you what you\u2019re really interested in!)\n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE\u2605\u2605\u2605\nYou cannot watch a Solar Eclipse without protective ECLIPSE GLASSES. \nMany fake eclipse glasses have been sold on Amazon.com\nPlease read these articles and be safe!  \nhttps://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/iso-certification\nHere is an approved list of vendors:\nhttps://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters\nThe key is to make sure they are ISO and CE certified. You should not be able to see ANYTHING other than the Sun. \nhttps://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/iso-certification\nWe thank our friends at solareclipseshield.com for sponsoring this video! \n\nWe dedicate this video to our wonderful friend and VIP Patron, Tracy Karin Prell. Tracy works tirelessly to promote astronomy awareness. We\u2019ll be thinking of you, Tracy, when totality arrives on August 21, 2017 for the Total Solar Eclipse in the United States! \n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735What is an Eclipse?\nSolar Eclipse vs Lunar Eclipse (Astronomy)\n\nWhat is an Eclipse? You may be a little confused about the difference between a Solar Eclipse and a Lunar Eclipse. You know an Eclipse has something to do with the Earth getting in the way of the Moon -- or, is it the Moon getting in the way of the Sun? Which is for a Solar Eclipse, and which is for a Lunar Eclipse? In this video, we\u2019ll take a closer look.\n\nSometimes, the Sun, the Earth, and the Moon all line up along a straight line. When the Earth is in the middle, the shadow of the Earth can fall on the Moon, which is a Lunar Eclipse. OR, in the other arrangement, with the Moon in the middle, the shadow of the Moon can fall on the Earth, which is a Solar Eclipse. Notice that these Eclipses only happen during a New Moon (in the case of a Solar Eclipse) or a Full Moon (in the case of a Lunar Eclipse). But why don\u2019t these happen every single month? \n\nYou know that the Moon orbits the Earth, and the Earth orbits the Sun. But these orbits don\u2019t take place in the same PLANE.  There\u2019s a difference of about 5 degrees between the plane of the Earth\u2019s orbit and the plane of the Moon\u2019s orbit. The two orbital planes intersect along what we call the \u201cLine of Nodes.\u201d This line passes through the Earth. It\u2019s only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon all line up juuust right along the line of nodes, that you get an eclipse. Learn to distinguish the phases of the Total Solar Eclipse, including Baily's Beads, The Diamond Ring phase, and Totality when you can see the Sun's Corona. \n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction to Eclipses\n1:00 Solar vs Lunar Eclipse\n1:58 Line of Nodes\n2:10 Ecliptic Plane\n2:30 Celestial Sphere idea\n3:00 Lunar Eclipse details\n3:30 Solar Eclipse details\n4:50 Annular Eclipse\n5:15 Eclipse Glasses\n5:45 Phases of the Solar Eclipse\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CONNECT WITH US\nWe hope you will share our videos on social media\u2014that really helps us grow.

What are Intermolecular Forces? These are the electrostatic attractions that draw different chemical species together. There are two main kinds of intermolecular forces: dipole interactions and dispersion forces. In this video, we'll do a survey of the various kinds of intermolecular bonds, collectively known as \"van der Waals Interactions.\" \n\n\"INTER-\" refers to the forces between two different chemical species. \"INTRA-\" refers to the forces within a SINGLE chemical molecule or compound that holds it together.

In this video, we\u2019ll help you level up your searching techniques and make you a Google Pro. \n\nAre you making the most of GOOGLE - the world\u2019s largest search engine? Part of being a great student is knowing how to make the best use of all the educational resources you have at your disposal.  It\u2019s the biggest repository of knowledge ever in the history of mankind - but it\u2019s not going to do you much good unless you know how to use it.  \n\nIf you\u2019d like to get faster and better at Google, try these tips and tricks!\n\nYou can jump to each Google Tip here:\n0:55  Use Multiple Keywords\n1:29  Use Quotation Marks\n3:05  Use the Minus Operator to Exclude\n3:27  Use the OR Operator\n3:48  Use the Number Range Operator\n4:12  Use the Site Operator\n4:30  Use Define\n4:48  Use the Around Operator\n5:26  Use the Wildcard Operator\n5:49  Use the Filetype Operator\n\nNOTE: Because Google is always changing and improving, there is a chance that these tricks and shortcuts may not always be supported in the future. At the time we made this video, we tested them all and they were all working for us here at Socratica Studios. Hope they help your searching!\n\nWe were able to make this video thanks to the support of our Patrons on Patreon.  We are so thankful for their continued interest and support.

In Python, there are a variety of ways to sort lists, tuples, and other objects.  Today we talk about the sort() method which is an in-place algorithm for sorting lists.  We also cover the sorted() function which can be used on more objects, and creates a sorted copy, leaving the original object unchanged.\n\nWe were able to make this Python video with the help of our Patrons on Patreon!

Groups generalize a wide variety of mathematical sets: the integers, symmetries of shapes, modular arithmetic, NxM matrices, and much more.  After learning about groups in detail, you will then be ready to continue your study of abstract algebra be learning about rings, fields, modules and vector spaces.\n\nOur sincere thanks go out to our VIP Patron, Matt Peters.

      "description": "Do you have a big test coming up?  We can help you get a great grade with our Test-taking tips. Lots of people struggle with tests because of test anxiety or they just don\u2019t know how to make the best use of their time when they are taking a test. Make sure you can show how much you know when you take a test by using these techniques. \n\nFirst, you may want to watch our video on How to Study for a Test here: http://bit.ly/2qjQFI1  Then watch this video, which is all about what to do when you actually take the test.  \n\nOne of the techniques we discuss in this video is recognizing special keywords that change the meaning of a question - words like ALWAYS, NEVER, SOMETIMES, EVERY, NOT, etc. We suggest you circle or underline those words when you read a question, so you don\u2019t accidentally answer incorrectly.  Let\u2019s collect those words in the comment section below. \n\nAnd if you have another test-taking tip, please share it in the comment section so we can all be great students! \n\nThis video was made possible by the generous donations from our VIP Patrons on Patreon!

      "description": "Simple groups are the building blocks of finite groups.  After decades of hard work, mathematicians have finally classified all finite simple groups.  Today we talk about why simple groups are so important, and then cover the four main classes of simple groups: cyclic groups of prime order, alternating groups An (n bigger than 4), groups of Lie type, and the 26 sporadic groups, including the Monster Group.\n\nBe sure to subscribe so you don't miss new lessons from Socratica:  \nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend the following textbooks:\nDummit & Foote, Abstract Algebra 3rd Edition\nhttp://amzn.to/2oOBd5S\n\nMilne, Algebra Course Notes (available free online)\nhttp://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/index.html \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n \n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nTeaching\u200b \u200bAssistant:\u200b \u200b\u200b \u200bLiliana\u200b \u200bde\u200b \u200bCastro \nWritten\u200b \u200b&\u200b \u200bDirected\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bMichael\u200b \u200bHarrison \nProduced\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bKimberly\u200b \u200bHatch\u200b \u200bHarrison\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

      "description": "Are you always searching for the right word? Today, we offer our best tips on how to improve your vocabulary. When you grow your vocabulary, it has a positive effect on ALL areas of communication - whether you are speaking or writing formally or informally.  Being able to accurately describe your thoughts is an essential component of exchanging ideas with anyone. \n\nIf you need to build vocab in a hurry (for the SAT or GRE, for example), try our hints to increase your vocabulary in a directed way. Start by reading - both your current textbooks, as well as other books and articles that interest you. Pay special attention to words you don't recognize. Seize those words and make them yours! Underline them, look them up in a dictionary and thesaurus, and if you still have trouble remembering them, make flashcards.  We have another video with advice on how to best use flashcards here:\nhttp://bit.ly/2p0ifrg\n\nDon\u2019t forget to check out our FREE educational apps on the Google Play Store.  We have two word games featured in this video: \nWords Words Words, and Words of Distinction. \nhttp://bit.ly/1MqSHsM\n\nThis video was made possible by the generous donations from our VIP Patrons on Patreon!

These included the electric lightbulb, the phonograph, and a large number of improvements to the telegraph. \n\nIn this video, we trace the story of Edison's life, from his humble beginnings as a poor home-schooled child with hearing loss, to his entrepreneurial adolescence, to his almost unbelievable success as an researcher, engineer, innovator, and inventor. \n\nWe would like to thank our Patrons on Patreon for their generous support of Socratica.

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends! We\u2019re here to help you be a great student! Are you interested in studying Physics, but you don\u2019t know where to start? Today we have a special guest, Simon Clark, PhD, who will give us some great advice about how to study Physics. We\u2019ll talk about how Simon got inspired by Physics demonstrations and activities as a kid, and how his studies progressed at Oxford and the University of Exeter. You may be surprised to hear how much math is involved when you study Physics! Simon gives some great practical advice about how to learn this most fundamental of the sciences. \n\nSimon made a video that ties in with this one, all about the Physics books he would recommend for you.

The four clauses in Python Exception handling are try, except, else, and finally.  These give you the ability to handle an error (except), a success (else), or either (finally).  Today we introduce the most common types of exceptions in Python, and then show you how to use all 4 exception clauses.\nTo learn Python, start our Python Playlist HERE:\nhttp://bit.ly/PythonHelloWorld\n\nSubscribe to Socratica: http://bit.ly/1ixuu9W\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend:\nPython Cookbook, Third edition from O\u2019Reilly\nhttp://amzn.to/2sCNYlZ\n\nThe Mythical Man Month - Essays on Software Engineering & Project Management\nhttp://amzn.to/2tYdNeP\n\nShop Amazon Used Textbooks - Save up to 90%\nhttp://amzn.to/2pllk4B\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nPython instructor: Ulka Simone Mohanty  (@ulkam on Twitter)\nWritten & Produced by Michael Harrison  (@mlh496 on Twitter)\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nYoda, Star Wars The Exhibition, Madrid\nhttps://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:YODA_(3343464749).jpg\nAuthor: Daniel Huntley\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

SPF means \"Sun Protection Factor\" and in this video we'll explain what the numbers really mean.\n\nIt's Summer and the SUN is out to get you! Not really. But it is up to you to protect your skin from harmful UV rays. Time to put on extra sunscreen! Do you know how sunscreen works? \n\nOur special summer video explains the Science of Sunscreen. We break down what kinds of radiation are coming from the Sun (Visible light, Infrared, and Ultraviolet rays), and which of these cause burning, wrinkles, and skin cancer. We describe the difference between Physical Sunscreen and Chemical sunscreens, and discuss what is meant by \u201cBroad Spectrum\u201d protection. We also explain which sunscreens are considered \u201cReef Safe!\u201d\n\nIf you'd like to see more great STEM videos from Socratica, please subscribe! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\u2600\ufe0f\n\nWe would like to thank our VIP Patrons on Patreon for making this video possible!

      "description": "The field is one of the key objects you will learn about in abstract algebra.  Fields generalize the real numbers and complex numbers.  They are sets with two operations that come with all the features you could wish for: commutativity, inverses, identities, associativity, and more.  They give you a lot of freedom to do mathematics similar to regular algebra.  Today we motivate the definition of a field by looking at 6 different groups, give the formal definition, and talk about the characteristic of the field and the starting point for all fields - prime fields.\n\nBe sure to subscribe so you don't miss new lessons from Socratica:  \nhttp://bit.ly/1ixuu9W \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n \n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend the following textbooks:\nDummit & Foote, Abstract Algebra 3rd Edition\nhttp://amzn.to/2oOBd5S\n\nMilne, Algebra Course Notes (available free online)\nhttp://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/index.html \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nTeaching\u200b \u200bAssistant:\u200b \u200b\u200b \u200bLiliana\u200b \u200bde\u200b \u200bCastro \nWritten\u200b \u200b&\u200b \u200bDirected\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bMichael\u200b \u200bHarrison \nProduced\u200b \u200bby\u200b \u200bKimberly\u200b \u200bHatch\u200b \u200bHarrison\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends! We\u2019re here to help you be a great student! Did you know that reading a textbook is different from reading for pleasure? Hopefully you *will* have fun reading your textbook, but what we mean is that you don\u2019t read your textbook straight through, cover to cover. Instead, we have a much more efficient technique to tell you about!\n\nThe steps for How To Read a Textbook  include:\n\u2666  Pre-reading (read the title, headings, and examine the illustrations)\n\u2666  Read the summaries (the condensed info at the beginning and the end of the chapter)\n\u2666  Read while taking notes\n\u2666  Review your notes (and quiz yourself).\n\nDon\u2019t forget how useful the Table of Contents and the Glossary can be! Many people forget to use these important parts of their textbooks. \n\nHow many of these steps do you do?  Do you want to improve your Reading Skills? We challenge you to change the way you read your textbook. It will make your studying much more efficient! Never feel overwhelmed by your homework reading assignment again!\n\nLet us know about your favourite study tips in the comments. \nWe want to know what you think!  \n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nWe would like to thank our Patrons who made this video possible!  \nBecause of them, our videos are free for everyone on YouTube.

Are you worried about Standardized Tests? Do you have to prepare to take the SAT? ACT? GRE? TOEFL, LSAT, MCAT?  The Socratica Team has taken SO many of these tests (and we've done pretty well, not gonna lie). We can help. \n\nThere's a lot of mystery surrounding standardized testing. This video will help you understand the ACT & SAT. When you understand what they're looking for, your worries will disappear. Then it all comes down to practice! \n\nWe partnered with Magoosh Online Test Prep for this video. They have a special offer for our Socratica Friends! They made a special page just for us: \nhttps://magoosh.com/socratica\nVisit and take advantage of discounts and also some free goodies on this page!\n\nOur most important piece of advice: NO CRAMMING!\nOur general rule of thumb: Only study what you DON'T know. \nPractice is key. Give yourself tons of time to practice. Not all at once! Break it into chunks, a little every day. \n\nThis video covers our advice for taking standardized tests in general.

But Pi just kept coming up over and over in math and physics. We used it so much, we almost accidentally learned about 6 digits by heart. But you can learn more - a LOT more! \n\nIn this video, we share 3 of our favourite techniques for memorizing digits of Pi. We\u2019ve even found a method for quickly memorizing 100 digits of Pi! \n\nImpress your friends on Pi Day (March 14th)  3-14 is Pi Day, which people celebrate by walking in circles, eating Pie, and reciting digits of Pi. \nThere's also Pi Approximation Day (22/7 or July 22nd) - a second chance to celebrate!\n\nDo you have another method for learning the digits of Pi? Tell us about it in the comments!\n\nWe have a FREE App to Learn Digits of Pi:\nhttp://bit.ly/Pi_App\n\nIn this video, we mentioned this book as a source:\nSecrets of Mental Math by Arthur Benjamin & Michael Shermer\nhttps://amzn.to/2ENOMZS\n\nIf you\u2019d like to get your kids interested in Pi, we have a video over on our Kids\u2019 channel especially for them! \nhttp://bit.ly/Pi4Kids\n\nThe 626 Music video from the Fung Brothers \nhttp://bit.ly/626_Song\n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe would like to recognize our VIP Patrons who made this video possible!

In our examples we will introduce CROSS JOINs, Unions, the CONCAT() function, and the COALESCE() function.\n\nOur SQL playlist starts here: \n\u21aahttp://bit.ly/Socratica_SQL\n\nBe sure to SUBSCRIBE for more SQL!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nYou may also enjoy our Python playlist:\n\u21aahttp://bit.ly/PythonSocratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nSQL instructor: Ulka Simone Mohanty  (@ulkam on Twitter)\nWritten & Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison (@khhsocratica) & Michael Harrison (@mlh496)\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

      "description": "Indexes in SQL are used to speed up SQL queries.  A database index works much like an index in a book.  For example, if you have a database table with a list of people, a common query would be to lookup someone by name.  Creating an index means the database will not have to scan the entire table looking for matches.  Instead, it will restrict its search to a small portion of the rows.\n\nIn this video we use a table with 100 million rows to illustrate how much an index can change the speed of a query.\n\nOur SQL playlist starts here: \n\u21aahttp://bit.ly/Socratica_SQL\n\nBe sure to SUBSCRIBE for more SQL!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nYou may also enjoy our Python playlist:\n\u21aahttp://bit.ly/PythonSocratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nSQL instructor: Ulka Simone Mohanty  (@ulkam on Twitter)\nWritten & Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison (@khhsocratica) & Michael Harrison (@mlh496)\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

If you want to create your own website, go to: https://www.wix.com/go/socratica\n\nDo you need to learn how to make a professional website from scratch? This video is a step by step guide. Follow along as we make the Socratica Study Tips Website.  Our friends at Wix sponsored this video. We used one of their FREE templates to build our new Study Tips site!  Check it out at \nhttps://socratica.wixsite.com/studytips\n\nThis video shares our tips on making a website. Notice that it's a very short website tutorial! That's because a lot of the work was already done for us. We were able to build our website in a single afternoon.\n\nYou may be wondering why we didn't build our own site from scratch. Well, back in the day when we first started Socratica, we did! We designed, coded, debugged, the whole shebang. And it took us MONTHS. We just don't have the time to make a site from scratch and keep up with our other work at Socratica. We'd rather spend the time making more videos for you!\n\nHave a look at our new site and tell us what you think! The nice thing about working from a template and WYSIWYG editor is it's really easy to change it up. \n\nDo you need a website? This is one easy and inexpensive way to do it. Visit https://www.wix.com/go/socratica and try it out. \n\nFeatures on our new Study Tips website:\n\u25cf  Catalog of all of our Study Tip videos\n\u25cf  Coming Soon \n\u25cf  Reading List (a short list of books we recommend)\n\nLet us know what you think of our website tutorial in the comments.

What are you going to MAJOR in?  What, you don't know what you're doing for the rest of your life yet?\n\nDon't worry, Socratica Friends. Let's talk about how to figure out what college major is right for you. For instance, we recommend you start paying closer attention to what GRABS your attention!  What headlines do you pay attention to in the news? Are you interested in medical discoveries? Or are you more interested in what's happening in politics? Little clues like this will help you become more aware of what might be your true calling in life. \n\nYou may also be interested in taking an \"Interests Assessment\" test. Your school may offer one of these for free, so be sure to check with your campus career development office. But if not, there are companies that will give you one of these tests (like the Strong Inventory Assessment) and explain what your scores mean. \n\nYou can also, of course, ask your friends and family for advice. But remember, ultimately, this is YOUR decision. So listen to your heart! And your gut. And your brain. \n\nYou can jump to each section in the video:\n0:00 Introduction - Look at College Catalogs\n1:15 What grabs your attention?\n1:30 Talk to current students & instructors\n2:05 Shadow a professional\n2:25 Examine your interests\n3:20 Examine your strengths\n4:30 Ask your friends & family\n5:05 Try on a decision for a while\n5:40 Take a formal assessment\n6:15 Remember you can change your mind!\n\n\n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nDo you want to be a GREAT STUDENT? \nWe\u2019ve collected all our best Study Tips into a playlist for you:\nhttp://bit.ly/StudyTipsPlaylist\n\nOur most popular videos are:\nHow to Use the Feynman Technique  http://bit.ly/TheFeynmanTechnique\nHow to Use Flash Cards  http://bit.ly/Flashcards_Studytips\nHow to Study Physics  http://bit.ly/StudyTipsPhysics\nHow to Take Great Notes (Cornell Technique)  http://bit.ly/Cornell_Notes\nHow to Study Programming  http://bit.ly/Learn_Programming\nHow to Learn a Foreign Language  http://bit.ly/Learn_Lang\nHow to Use the Pomodoro Technique  http://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nOne easy way to support Socratica is to shop using our affiliate links.

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends! We've built you a Study Tips Website! If you want to create your own website, go to: https://www.wix.com/go/socratica\nWe often suggest you go to your instructor\u2019s Office Hours. It\u2019s like free, expert tutoring. But do you know how to actually use this valuable resource? There\u2019s more to it than just showing up. \nFirst, you need to do some preparation. Don\u2019t go in to office hours empty handed. You should bring in very specific questions that your professor or TA can help you with. \nWe recommend you use the CORSON technique. This is a simple but very effective study method, introduced by Physics professor and Cornell president Dale Corson. \nThe key to the Corson Technique is to carefully identify where your understanding breaks down. This usually means going very SLOWLY through the reading or equations, step by step, until you find where you really get stuck. Document this! Make a note of everything you\u2019ve tried, and bring these notes with you to office hours. This will help your instructor help you.  Effective learning is a team effort.

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends! We\u2019re here to help you be a Great Student. Do you think Multiple Choice tests are unfair? Is this because you don\u2019t do very well on them? Be honest, now. Wouldn\u2019t you like to know how to do better on these tests? We can help.  \nThe truth is, that while multiple choice tests can seem tricky, they really can be the best way to test for CERTAIN kinds of knowledge. Namely - can you draw distinctions between closely related ideas? \n\nTo do well on Multiple choice tests, you have to stay calm and proceed through the test without getting too hung up on any one question. In this video, we share some of our best strategies for doing well on multiple choice tests.  Our number one tip is to take a practice test, and then use it to figure out what you DON\u2019T know.  Then, study only the material you don\u2019t know! This can feel uncomfortable, but it really is the most efficient use of your time. After studying, then re-test yourself, only on those topics you previously missed. Now, you have a much better chance of success on the real test, and you haven\u2019t wasted precious study time on material you were already going to get right on the test. \n\nWatch for more of our best techniques for doing well on Multiple Choice Tests!\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe would like to recognize our VIP Patrons who made this video possible!

      "description": "Does VR fool your brain into thinking it\u2019s really there? When done well, Virtual Reality makes you actually FEEL like you\u2019re in a different place. We call this VR experience PRESENCE. How does this happen?\nIn this video, we\u2019ll explain how VR tricks your brain into feeling like you\u2019re IN a 3D world, and not just watching a 2D video. It does this by showing a slightly different picture to each eye. \n\nTo understand the science of VR, you\u2019ll need to understand the science of vision. We\u2019ll discuss how our vision works normally, and how VR video exploits the natural process of vision to fool you! \n\nThis is a VR180 video, which means we\u2019ve captured an entire hemisphere for you.  To experience this fully for yourself, you should watch this video using a VR headset.  This can be as simple as Google Cardboard, or you can use one of the fancier headsets like the Oculus Quest or Lenovo Daydream. If you don\u2019t have a headset, you can still experience the 180 nature of the video by scrolling the screen around with your finger. Don\u2019t miss our special guest who has monocular vision\u2026\n\nWe\u2019d like to thank the YouTube Creator Lab and VR Scout for giving Socratica the opportunity to learn how to make VR videos for you!

You\u2019ll see our video is 3 dimensions, just like in real life! We recommend you wear a VR headset for the full effect. If you don\u2019t have VR goggles, that\u2019s ok!  Just swipe around on your phone and you\u2019ll still get to see the hemisphere. \n\nDid you know that it takes a lot of math to make VR videos work? In this video, we\u2019ll explain the role of math in virtual reality - from Snell\u2019s Law and the optics of VR cameras, which is needed to understand how light is bent by the fisheye lenses in the camera and captured onto the camera\u2019s sensor; to projection mapping - how a curved image is drawn onto a flat surface.  \n\nWe experience depth in real life thanks to a phenomenon called \u201cparallax\u201d - and we\u2019ll talk about how this effect is replicated in VR videos.  \n\nWe\u2019d like to thank the YouTube Creator Lab and VR Scout for giving Socratica the opportunity to learn how to make VR videos for you!  Stay tuned as we continue to explore this new technology in several future videos.\n\nHere's our video explaining the SCIENCE of VR: \nhttp://bit.ly/VR_Science\n\nAnd the TECH of VR:\nhttp://bit.ly/VR_Tech_\n\nSubscribe here (and ring the bell) to be notified of our next videos:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend the following texts and devices to help you enjoy VR:\n\nNeuromancer by William Gibson\n(Science Fiction predicting Virtual Reality)\nhttps://amzn.to/2N7G14f\n\nSnow Crash by Neal Stephenson\n(Science Fiction exploring Virtual Reality)\nhttps://amzn.to/2X0D3TQ\n\nOculus Quest VR Headset\nhttps://amzn.to/2Rv9XWL\n\nOculus Rift S VR Headset\nhttps://amzn.to/2IAH3l3\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nHost: Liliana De Castro\nWritten & Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison and Michael Harrison\n#VR180  #VR #VirtualReality\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

      "description": "This video is best enjoyed in a VR headset, such as Google Cardboard or Oculus Rift. \nAre you curious about how VR works?  We made a 3-part series about the STEM of VR, explaining the Science of VR, the Math of VR, and now the Technology of VR.  By Technology, we mean - how do gadgets like VR Headsets work to create Virtual Reality?  \n\nIn this video, we explain the history of this technology - the story starts earlier than you might think. Have you ever seen a stereoscope, which allows you to view 3D images? They date back to the 1800s!  You may have played with a Viewmaster, which is a more recent version of the stereoscope. Then we discuss modern-day efforts to make Virtual Reality part of your world, including the Oculus Rift. There are technical issues to address in VR, including camera design, computers to manipulate the footage, transmission of the video so it\u2019s smooth (not choppy or disorienting), and then finally, watching the video in a special headset. \n\nThis is a VR180 video, which means you can look all around a hemisphere, and it is in 3D! \nWe recommend watching this video while wearing a VR headset for the full 3D immersive experience.  But if you don\u2019t have a VR headset like Oculus or Google Cardboard, that\u2019s okay. You can still swipe your finger around on your phone to explore the hemispherical 180 degree view.  \n\nHere are our other STEM of VR videos for you to explore:\nThe Science of VR  http://bit.ly/VR_Science\nThe Math of VR  http://bit.ly/VR_Math\n\nWe\u2019d like to thank the YouTube Creator Lab and VR Scout for giving Socratica the opportunity to learn how to make VR videos for you!\n\nSubscribe here (and ring the bell) to be notified of our next videos:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe recommend the following texts and devices to help you enjoy VR:\n\nNeuromancer by William Gibson\n(Science Fiction predicting Virtual Reality)\nhttps://amzn.to/2N7G14f\n\nSnow Crash by Neal Stephenson\n(Science Fiction exploring Virtual Reality)\nhttps://amzn.to/2X0D3TQ\n\nOculus Quest VR Headset\nhttps://amzn.to/2Rv9XWL\n\nOculus Rift S VR Headset\nhttps://amzn.to/2IAH3l3\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba  Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba  Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba  We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nConnect with us!\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/SocraticaStudios/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/SocraticaStudios/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Socratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nHost: Liliana De Castro\nWritten & Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison and Michael Harrison\n#VR180  #VR #VirtualReality\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666",

We have a very personal question to ask you:  Do you love to read?  Reading has made such a huge difference in our lives - it really has changed our lives many times, and always for the better. But sadly, many people fall out of the habit of reading when they leave school - that is, if they ever had the habit in the first place.  Let\u2019s talk about how to build this very healthy habit!\n\nFirst, don\u2019t force yourself to read something you think you really SHOULD read. Think about what you LIKE to read. Pick a genre that excites you - mystery, sci-fi, whatever you like - and start there! \n\nPick a book, and take it with you wherever you go. That way you can sneak in a few pages here and there, when you\u2019re waiting in line, when you\u2019re having a coffee break. You\u2019ll be surprised how much reading you can do when you give yourself the opportunity. \n\nIf you find you\u2019re not crazy about that first book, that\u2019s ok!  Don\u2019t force yourself to finish a book you don\u2019t like. There are SO many books out there, and you\u2019ll never read them all. Put down that book and pick up another one. Keep trying!\n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nShare your reading quest with a friend who knows you well.

Chronic stress is bad for your health!\n\nToday we\u2019re going to talk about some common sources of stress for students, and see if there are some ways you can eliminate -  or at least minimize - their impact on your life. \n\nSome of these common sources of stress include: procrastination (and bad time management in general), lack of focus (and the concepts of mindfulness/meditation to improve your mental focus), and neglecting your social relationships. There\u2019s also the physical side. Self care sends a beneficial message to your body that you are taking care of yourself! It\u2019s important to eat right, get a little exercise, and lots of sleep. When in doubt, spend some time outside, and watch your caffeine intake. Everything in moderation! \n\nRemember that there are professional counselors available, especially if you are at a school. There are also \u201csliding scale\u201d professionals that will work with your budget. Everyone can benefit from talking through their life challenges with a counselor. \n\nYou can find other videos about this important topic by searching for #MentalHealthAwareness\n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nYou can jump to chapters in this video by clicking on the timestamps:\n0:00 Is all stress bad?\n1:05 How Procrastination causes stress\n2:33 How Forgetfulness causes stress\n3:03 How Lack of Focus causes stress\n3:54 How Being Late causes stress\n4:14 Strategy for Being on Time\n5:50 Make the Most of Small Chunks of Time\n6:20 How to beat Classroom Stress\n6:53 How Friends help you beat stress\n7:15 How Counseling can help stress\n7:47 The Physical side is important, too\n7:58 Eating Right can help stress\n8:30 How Nature can help stress\n8:43 Be Careful with Caffeine Intake\n9:00 Prioritize Your Sleep to reduce stress\n9:48 Exercise to reduce stress\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe would like to recognize our VIP Patrons who made this video possible!

      "description": "Hello Socratica Friends! We\u2019re here to help you be a great student. And being a great student doesn\u2019t stop when the school day ends. There are some important steps to take to make sure you keep on being a great student when you get home. So ask yourself - do you have a great place to study at home, that keeps you focused?\n\nToday we talk about how to pick an ideal spot to study, and what you need to do your work there. Does it have to be huge? No. Does it have to be fancy? No! All you need is a simple, sturdy table and chair. We\u2019ll discuss what you need to have with you when you study, and what amounts to unnecessary clutter. We\u2019ll take some cues from our hero of organization, Marie Kondo, as well as incorporate design principles and elements to enhance well-being, including Feng Shui. We also remind you of the importance of ergonomics. Are you slumped over in your chair? With a few adjustments, you can be a lot more comfortable and a lot more productive. \n\nWe referred to The Pomodoro Technique in this video. Here\u2019s our video about it - it\u2019s really one of our very favourite techniques, and we use it every day, even just in real life. TRY IT. \nhttp://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\n\nIf you liked this video, try our Study Tips playlist!

Today we learn about The SCIENCE of Chocolate. \r\n\nOur investigation takes us to Idyllwild, California and the \"Bean to Bar\" chocolatiers at El Buen Cacao. \r\n\nWe'll meet the expert chocolatiers, and learn about every step of the chocolate making process - harvesting the cacao, fermenting, drying, and roasting the beans, removing the shell to extract the cacao nibs, grinding the nibs to make cocoa liquor, tempering the chocolate, and finally pouring it into a bar. \r\n\nWe'll also discuss the remarkable chemical properties of cocoa butter. Did you know it has SIX solid forms? How do you know if your chocolate is good chocolate? What is that white bloom you sometimes see on chocolate?

      "description": "Free Resume Template: http://bit.ly/GetResumeTemplate\n\nHello my Socratica Friends! We\u2019re here to help you be a GREAT student.  I know we mostly talk about STUDYING in this series, but today we\u2019re going to discuss what happens at the end of all that studying. You\u2019re going to have to get a JOB. And to do that, you have to APPLY for a job. And to do THAT, you\u2019re going to need a RESUME. \n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe created a FREE TEMPLATE for a targeted #resume. It\u2019s one page (fill in with your information) - and it also has a page of simple instructions. Follow along with this video for more detailed instructions and advice. \nLink to free resume template here: http://bit.ly/GetResumeTemplate\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nThis video is very practical. We take you through the whole process of creating a TARGETED RESUME.  This is a special kind of simple, one-page resume that is specific for one job. That means you\u2019ll tailor each targeted resume to each specific job application. \n\nWe know that sounds like a lot of work - and it is! But we\u2019re not suggesting you do this for every possible job. Read the job description carefully, and only create a targeted resume if you believe you are well-qualified to do this job. Also, consider whether you really WANT to do this job! Remember, you are choosing to apply for jobs, just as much as the hiring managers are choosing whether or not to hire you. \n\nIf this is the first time you\u2019re writing a resume, it can seem like a daunting task. But we break it down for you! How do you know what to put in the Qualifications section? (It\u2019s in the Job Description). What kind of experience should you list? (Not your entire work history). Even if you\u2019ve written your resume before, we encourage you to try our tips & tricks for creating a simplified, TARGETED resume. We think you\u2019ll find it\u2019s the best way to showcase who you are for this job application. \n\nWe referred to getting good search results (Google Tips) in this video. Here\u2019s our video about it:\nhttp://bit.ly/Google_Tips\n\nHere's the useful website we found that listed Employment Skills for various jobs. Note that this list will change with time. http://bit.ly/EmploymentSkillsList\n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nThis video was made possible by our VIP Patrons on Patreon! \nWe are so grateful for their support.

      "description": "Are you taking classes online? Do you need help figuring out Distance Learning? Socratica Friends, we\u2019re here to help.  You don\u2019t have to be in a classroom to be a Great Student. But there are some important differences about the best ways to study for Online Courses. \n\nOne big difference is that you are on your own to manage your time. Don\u2019t try to cram all your online courses in one day! We\u2019ll give you some practical advice about how to break up your study time. The best method we know for this is the Pomodoro Technique. We made a video all about it. Try it!! http://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\n\nAnother difference in online learning is how you will be participating. Discussion forums are the most common way you will be required to participate for your online classes, but some instructors arrange for meetings with Google Hangouts, Skype, or Zoom. Be prepared if this is the case with a webcam. You can use your phone camera in a pinch. \n\nFind a quiet place in your house to claim as your special study spot. This will help you take your online classes seriously. Every time you sit down in your study spot, you\u2019ll be ready to work. We have a video to help you get your desk organized: http://bit.ly/Organize_Desk  \n\nWe\u2019d like to thank our VIP Patrons for their generous support. Thanks to their kind gifts, we\u2019re able to make our educational videos FREE for the world.

      "description": "Did you know that Public Speaking is the NUMBER ONE PHOBIA? That means, if you hate giving presentations, you\u2019re NOT alone. But sharing the knowledge you\u2019ve learned is an important part of being a great student. What\u2019s more, when you enter the workforce, you\u2019ll find it\u2019s almost certainly going to be a part of your job.\n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll share some great tips about giving great presentations. \nFirst, consider what kind of presentation you\u2019ll be giving, because the preparation will be different. The three main kinds of presentations are: 1) Roundtable discussions 2) Panel presentations 3) Solo talk (usually a powerpoint presentation). \n\nIf you\u2019re in a big hurry, you can jump to different parts of the video for these three different types of presentations, but we do suggest you watch the whole thing because there\u2019s a lot of good general advice in here!\n 1:29   Roundtable Discussion\n 2:54   Panel Presentation\n 4:49   Solo Talk (Powerpoint presentation)\n\nPowerpoint (or Google Slides) is a great tool, but is often misused. We\u2019ll spend some time talking about the common pitfalls, and give you tips for using this tool well, including how to simplify your slides down to the essential information.  \n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666  to Socratica to get our newest videos! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nThis video was made possible by our VIP Patrons on Patreon! \n\nOur amazingly generous Patrons include Tracy Karin Prell, Carlos Araujo, Markie Waid, Martin Stephens, David Borger, Burhan Saifaddin, MdeG, Michael, Umar Khan, John Krawiec, Patrick Cool, Tim Tapio, Deeptanshu Malik, Kevin B, Terrill Frantz, Charles Southerland, Andre Gibbs, and Ahmed Sakr. \n\nWays to support our channel:\n\n\u25ba\u00a0 Join our Patreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 Make a one-time PayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\u25ba\u00a0 We also accept Bitcoin @ 1EttYyGwJmpy9bLY2UcmEqMJuBfaZ1HdG9\n\nThank you!\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nDo you want to be a GREAT STUDENT? \nWe\u2019ve collected all our best Study Tips into a playlist for you:\nhttp://bit.ly/StudyTipsPlaylist\n\nOur most popular videos are:\nHow to Use the Feynman Technique  http://bit.ly/TheFeynmanTechnique\nHow to Use Flash Cards  http://bit.ly/Flashcards_Studytips\nHow to Study Physics  http://bit.ly/StudyTipsPhysics\nHow to Take Great Notes (Cornell Technique)  http://bit.ly/Cornell_Notes\nHow to Study Programming  http://bit.ly/Learn_Programming\nHow to Learn a Foreign Language  http://bit.ly/Learn_Lang\nHow to Use the Pomodoro Technique  http://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nOne easy way to support Socratica is to shop using our affiliate links.

      "description": "Are you Working from Home? WFH is very challenging. We\u2019ve been working remotely for several months now, and it\u2019s not easy!  We share what we\u2019ve learned so far about how to work from home effectively, and how to avoid some common pitfalls including: loneliness, problems staying focused, and getting sore from sitting so much! \n\nYou may be beating yourself up about not being very productive. Our first piece of advice is to BE KIND to yourself! This is a very strange situation we all find ourselves in, and it\u2019s going to take some time to adjust. Hopefully we will learn some important lessons about how to better balance our work and home life that will make all of our lives better, even after we go back to the office and school. \n\nDo you find yourself getting distracted?  We\u2019ll give you some practical advice about how to stay focused. The best method we know for this is the Pomodoro Technique. We made a video all about it. Try it!! http://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\n\nIt can be very challenging to keep your work life and home life separate when you\u2019re working from home.  Find a quiet place in your house to claim as your work spot. Every time you sit down in your special spot, you\u2019ll be ready to work. We have a video to help you get your desk organized: http://bit.ly/Organize_Desk  \n\nIf you have to suddenly take classes online, you might find our video about distance learning helpful:\nhttps://bit.ly/Classes_Online\n\nWe dedicate this video to our Patrons on Patreon!

      "description": "Have you been afraid to try meditation? This calm, peaceful introduction to the subject will help dispel myths and misunderstandings about meditation. Come Meditate With Me! \n\nSocratica Friends, we\u2019ve been pretty stressed during the Pandemic Time. But one thing that has really helped has been practicing meditation. Did you know that there are lots of different kinds of meditation? There\u2019s Zazen Meditation (where you sit in the lotus position and pay close attention to your breath). There\u2019s Transcendental Meditation (where you repeat a special mantra to yourself). There\u2019s Guided Meditation, where a teacher takes you on a mental journey, and you practice visualization. There\u2019s no one perfect way to meditate. There are many ways to explore mindfulness.\n\nIf you\u2019ve been afraid of failing at meditation, please let that fear go. As long as you are trying to meditate, you ARE meditating! It\u2019s all in the trying. It\u2019s very natural to sit down to meditate and get distracted. That\u2019s kind of the whole point of meditating, actually - to get distracted, acknowledge it, and refocus back on your meditation. \n\nIn this video, Socratica co-founder Kimberly Hatch Harrison will explain some of the basics of meditation, and then lead you in a soothing Yoga Nidra practice. Don\u2019t let the name fool you - yoga nidra does not involve yoga poses on a mat. Rather, it\u2019s a quiet, simple mental exercise that involves scanning your body and becoming more aware and more present. This is a method to integrate your mind and your body (sometimes called mind-body integration). \n\nYou can jump to sections in the video here:\n0:00 Hello from Socratica - what we've been doing during the Pandemic\n0:58 Introduction to Meditation and Common Misconceptions\n6:04 Yoga Nidra Practice - a Guided Meditation with Body Scan\n\nOur study tips playlist is here: http://bit.ly/StudyTipsPlaylist\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\n\nWe send a special thanks to our Patrons on Patreon, who have kept us going during this hard time while we haven\u2019t been able to film with our hosts.

      "description": "Buy the book! How to Be a Great Student\nebook: https://amzn.to/2Lh3XSP\nPaperback: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\nKindle Unlimited: https://amzn.to/3atr8TJ\n\nAre you always running late? Doing things at the last minute? We can help, Socratica Friends! The tool you need is a PLANNER. But just owning a planner isn\u2019t enough. Let\u2019s talk about how to actually USE this magic little book to make your life so much easier. \n\n\u2666SIGN UP for Socratica Study Tips email list here:\nhttps://www.socratica.com/email-groups/study-tips\n\nWe do use Google calendar for communicating deadlines & meetings here at Socratica. But when it comes time to actually PLAN, we use a good old-fashioned paper planner. There\u2019s something about writing in a physical planner that helps us make sense of how to manage our time. Every year we buy an Academic Year planner from Moleskine: https://amzn.to/3qqHORI\n\nThe design of this planner works for us - on the left side is one week, with lots of room to write in each day. On the opposite side is a blank page, which is perfect for to-do lists. \n\nYou may actually find it more helpful for time management to see a whole month at a time. In that case, one of these giant desk blotter calendars might work for you: https://amzn.to/3ocwbvy\n\nYou start by writing all the important due dates in your planner. But that\u2019s not enough! To make your planner really work for you, you need to...COUNT BACKWARDS. \n\nCount back the number of days you will need to do your work, & then write in milestones you need to hit. For instance, if you\u2019re writing a paper, you write when it\u2019s due, & then when you\u2019ll finish your final draft, when you\u2019ll finish your rough draft, when you\u2019ll finish your research\u2026\n\nSame for preparing for a test. Write the date of the test, & then count back how many days you\u2019ll need to study for the test. Include times to take practice tests. This way you\u2019ll never have to cram for a test again! \n\nFor this technique to work, you\u2019ll need to have a good idea about how long each task takes. The POMODORO TECHNIQUE is perfect for this. You break your work into 20-25 minute chunks, & then you keep track of how many pomodoros it takes for you to do a typical task. We have a video all about this excellent study/ time management technique: \nhttp://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\n\nWe start this video with the basics, but you can also jump ahead to the section with Advanced Techniques for when you have a REALLY crammed schedule (like you are a full-time student & you have a job as well). Here are the important timestamps in the video:\n\n0:00  Introduction & Start of Basic Techniques\n1:14  Picking a planner\n2:25  Putting in the essentials\n2:53  Biggest tip (not rocket science)\n6:10  Start of Advanced Techniques\n\n\u2666 SUBSCRIBE \u2666 \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nDo you want to be a GREAT STUDENT? \nWe\u2019ve collected all our best Study Tips into a playlist for you:\nhttp://bit.ly/StudyTipsPlaylist\n\nOur most popular videos are:\nHow to Use the Feynman Technique  http://bit.ly/TheFeynmanTechnique\nHow to Use Flash Cards  http://bit.ly/Flashcards_Studytips\nHow to Use the Pomodoro Technique  http://bit.ly/PomodoroSocratica\nHow to Take Great Notes (Cornell Technique)  http://bit.ly/Cornell_Notes\nHow to Study Programming  http://bit.ly/Learn_Programming\nHow to Study Physics  http://bit.ly/StudyTipsPhysics\nHow to Learn a Foreign Language  http://bit.ly/Learn_Lang\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nThis video was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

What changes let you know a Chemical Reaction has happened, vs just a Physical change? For instance, you can probably tell ice melting is a physical change - especially because you can reverse it by sticking the water into a freezer and making ice cubes. Water is still H2O, whether it\u2019s frozen, or liquid, or even gas. But what about something more complicated, like butter? When you melt butter on the stove, at first you just get melted butter. But what about when it browns?\nDo you know that browning is a special kind of chemical reaction - the MAILLARD reaction? \nThere are other kinds of browning, too, like the DECOMPOSITON reaction that takes place when you melt sugar to make caramel. In this video, we\u2019ll talk about what distinguishes a chemical change from a physical change, & what are some signs to look for so you can tell the difference. To do this, first you\u2019ll need to be able to recognize what is a physical property, vs what is a chemical property of matter. Can you name some physical properties of matter? What about some chemical properties? Here\u2019s a hint - you won\u2019t really observe a chemical property of matter until it is actually taking part in a reaction!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 Intro - How do you know if a Chemical Reaction is Happening?\n1:22 Recognizing Physical Properties of Matter\n4:15 When a Chemical Reaction HASN'T happened\n5:12  What is \"browning?\" Maillard reaction and decomposition\n6:44  Physical Property vs Chemical Property\n7:35 List of some chemical properties\n8:00 Signs of a chemical reaction\n8:50 POP QUIZ - CHEMICAL or PHYSICAL change?\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

We\u2019re all about learning and growing here at Socratica, but this idea that you have to be PERFECT can really get in the way of enjoying the journey. Today, let\u2019s talk about recognizing the signs of perfectionism, and some healthy alternatives. \n\nIt may surprise you that avoiding work is a common sign of perfectionism. You might be so (subconsciously) afraid of harsh judgment - even just from yourself - that you put off work until the last minute. Then you\u2019re able to say, well, of course I didn\u2019t do my best, I only did it at the last second and in a couple hours. We\u2019ll talk about this and other less obvious signs that perfectionism is getting in your way. \n\nYou can jump to sections of the video here:\n0:00 Introduction\n1:18 Unreasonable Expectations\n2:30 What Perfectionism Costs You\n3:26 Perfectionism in Disguise\n4:32 Afraid of Judgment\n5:49 The Emotional Reasons: SHAME and FEAR\n7:01 Strategies for Fighting Perfectionism\n\n\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\u2666\nWe dedicate this video to our VIP Patrons on Patreon!

This leads to 3 categories of whole numbers: abundant, deficient, and perfect numbers.  We show there are an infinite number of abundant and deficient numbers, and then talk about what is known about perfect numbers.

Could it be that fear of failure is keeping you from stretching and growing? Socratica Friends, today we\u2019re talking about the Growth Mindset and how it can set you free - free to fail, and free to learn from failure. \n\nThe term  \u201cGrowth Mindset\u201d was coined by Stanford researcher Carol Dweck and her colleagues. The parallel idea is the \u201cFixed Mindset.\u201d  People with a Fixed Mindset are reluctant to take chances and risk failure, because they believe that everyone has a fixed potential, and that once you reach your ceiling, it\u2019s a waste of time to keep trying. \n\nPeople with a Growth Mindset, on the other hand, are willing to sometimes look foolish and fail publicly. It\u2019s worth it, you see, if you believe that people are capable of learning and growing through effort. \n\nThe research from Dweck and colleagues showed that the Fixed Mindset was less effective for learners. Not surprisingly, if you don\u2019t believe you are capable of growing and learning, you are less likely to keep trying after a single failure. The Growth Mindset, on the other hand, sets you up for success. \n\nIt\u2019s closely related to concepts of grit and perseverance - if you are willing to put up with some temporary discomfort caused by uncertainty and failure, the door remains open for you to move forward and continue to grow. \n\nIt\u2019s important for educators to keep this in mind, as well - the best learning environments support the growth mindset in their students. Teachers should maintain high standards, and let their students know that they believe they are capable of continued growth and advancement. It also turns out to be better to praise effort and a strong work ethic, rather than telling students they are especially smart or intelligent. If you are praised for your hard work, you are more likely to keep working hard to improve! \n\nIf you wish to develop your own growth mindset, we have some practical advice in this video.

The Ideal Gas Law works in most situations to predict the behavior of gases - as long as the temperature isn\u2019t too low, or the pressure too high, you can use the ideal gas law. It does involve some assumptions to make the math work - including assuming that collisions are perfectly elastic, and that the particles of gas are not attracted to each other. \n\nIn this video, we talk about the circumstances where you can use the Ideal Gas Law, how it\u2019s related to other gas laws (Boyle\u2019s Law, Charles\u2019s Law, and Avogadro\u2019s Law) and then we work through 5 example problems in full.

But do you know what KIND of chemical reaction? Chemists typically divide chemical reactions into 5 types:\n1) Synthesis (aka Combination)\n2) Decomposition (aka Analysis)\n3) Single Displacement (aka Single Replacement)\n4) Double Displacement (aka Double Replacement)\n5) Combustion\n\nBut there are other names you may have heard. Where do they fit in? \nFor instance, Precipitation reactions are a specific kind of double-displacement reaction. Same with neutralization reactions (when an acid + base react with each other and \"cancel each other out\"). \n\nIn this video, we'll learn to recognize these different kinds of chemical reactions. We'll do this by learning the GENERAL FORMS of each kind of reaction. For example, the general form of a synthesis reaction is A+B yields AB. \n\nWe'll also learn example reactions. These two techniques together are very powerful - because when you come across a new kind of reaction, you'll be able to recognize the similarities to a chemical reaction you already know, and to recognize the general form. \n\nCHAPTERS:\n0:00 Introduction to Types of Chemical Reactions\n0:45  5 Types of Chemical Reactions\n1:50  Synthesis \n3:24  Decomposition \n5:13  Single-Displacement\n7:47  Double-Displacement\n8:14  Precipitation example\n10:31  Gas Released  example\n11:30  Acid Base Neutralization example\n12:47  Combustion\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

But in the real world, we rarely stumble upon pure samples of anything! Almost everything we come in contact with is a mixture, rather than a pure element or compound. \nChemists classify matter according to how pure the sample is. This means you need to learn to distinguish between the following: pure substances (elements or compounds) and mixtures (homogeneous or heterogeneous). We\u2019ve created a flowchart to make this kind of classification easier. \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 What is Matter?\n0:39 What are Pure Substances?\n1:25  Flowchart to Classify Matter\n2:11  What\u2019s the difference between Elements and Compounds?\n3:08  The Law of Constant Composition aka the Law of Definite Proportions\n4:58  What are Mixtures?\n7:03  Homogeneous Mixtures vs Heterogeneous Mixtures\n9:25  Pop Quiz - classify these materials!\n11:37  Challenge Exercise - separate sea salt out of beach sand\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

Sign up here: https://snu.socratica.com/python\n\nIn Python, special methods are those \"odd looking\" methods that start and end with underscores.  They let you override operators, intercept the setting and getting of attributes, customize object serialization, and much more.  In this lesson we talk about the idea behind special methods and attributes, how to implement them, and give many examples along the way!\n\nSome of the special methods & attributes we will cover include:\n  __init__\n  __doc__\n  __setattr__\n  __str__\n  __getattr__\n  __getattribute__\n\nWe were able to bring you this video thanks to our generous Kickstarter backers!

You tell yourself you\u2019re going to study hard and get good grades, and within a couple weeks you\u2019ve slid back into all your old bad habits. We\u2019ve all been there. Socratica Friends, it\u2019s time to adopt some good study habits FOR REAL this time.\n\nWe think part of the problem is - you expect yourself to be PERFECT! Instead, let\u2019s focus on what is reasonable for all good students. In this video, we\u2019ll talk about what are the 12 (ish) BEST study habits to adopt - always with an eye on what is actually do-able. We say \u201c12-ish\u201d because there are a few extra tips thrown in here and there. You\u2019ll see! \n\nIf you have other tips you\u2019d like to share about how to get good grades in high school, college, or grad school, PLEASE add them in the comments!

Mathematica can be used in ANY computational field, including math, science, finance, data visualization, bioinformatics, speech recognition, machine learning...you name it! Mathematica started as a system for doing mathematics by computer, but it evolved into the WOLFRAM LANGUAGE, which can be used for all kinds of computation. \n\nThis is the FIRST episode of our new course on Mathematica.\nBe sure to sign up for our course email group (infrequent but excellent updates and messages):\n     https://snu.socratica.com/mathematica\n\nIn future lessons, we will explore many of the applications to scientific fields. We will also cover the essential mathematical applications: solving equations, numerical methods, calculus, differential equations, linear algebra, modular arithmetic, and much more. While doing so, we will cover the essential features of the Wolfram Language, the language that lies at the heart of Mathematica, Wolfram | One, and other products from Wolfram.\n\nThis video is an overview - a tour of some of its capabilities, to give you a feel for the incredible power of this tool. You may be surprised by Mathematica\u2019s flexibility and precision. \n\nNo prior programming experience is needed!

Our co-founder, Kimberly Hatch Harrison, is the creator behind our \"meta\" series of Study Tips, intended for students of all subjects. She writes this series, sharing her best advice for how to fix all your study woes. It doesn't matter if you study math, science, programming, or any subject, really\u2014our Study Tips series is for everyone.\n\nKimberly was something of a prodigy, teaching herself how to read somewhere around the age of 2 1/2, getting good grades all through grammar school. But when she started at an exclusive Prep school in the 9th grade, like a lot of gifted students, she suddenly had to learn HOW to learn. These methods brought her success through high school, through college at Caltech, and grad school at Princeton. Kim further developed her understanding of the best ways to learn as an instructor of biology and chemistry, both at the high school and college level. \n\nIn this book, Kimberly lets you in on all her secrets. Where did these tips come from? How did she figure it all out? Generally, the hard way, by making all kinds of mistakes. The important thing is, she LEARNED from those mistakes, and is here to share her hard-earned wisdom. \nJoin us for a reading from the beginning of the book! \nYou'll soon see why you probably need your own copy. \n\nHow to Be a Great Student\n  ebook: https://amzn.to/2Lh3XSP\n  Paperback: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n  Kindle Unlimited: https://amzn.to/3atr8TJ\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're in high school, college, or grad school.

What IS a Supermoon, and is it really all that big? How do astronomers describe the visual size, or APPARENT SIZE, of objects in the night sky?\n\nOne of the essential tools astronomers use is the SMALL ANGLE FORMULA. This is a way to quantify this relationship: for a given diameter, the ANGULAR SIZE of an object  decreases the farther away it is. \n\nToday we\u2019ll explain this formula, and work an example problem using the phenomena of SUPERMOONS and MICROMOONS. A Supermoon is a full moon at the closest point in the moon\u2019s orbit (PERIGEE) whereas a Micromoon is a full moon at the point in its orbit farthest from Earth (APOGEE). \n\nSupermoons aren't actually any bigger. The moon's diameter, or linear size, does not change. But its apparent size, or ANGULAR SIZE, does change! And that\u2019s what we are quantifying when we use the SMALL ANGLE FORMULA. It involves a little Trigonometry. \n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:43 Angular Size\n1:19 Setting up the Trigonometry problem\n2:03 Small Angle Formula\n2:39 Explaining units, arc-seconds\n3:42 Calculation: Supermoon vs Micromoon\n5:24 Challenge Problem: The Sun at Perihelion vs Aphelion\n\nWe hope you will post your answers to the Challenge problem on social media.

But when it comes time to measure distances of heavenly objects, it makes more sense to use the units AU, LY, and PC. That is, Astronomical Units, Light Years, and Parsecs. That\u2019s because space is REALLY big! \n\nToday we\u2019ll examine these units that are most commonly used to measure distances in space, and when it makes more sense to use one rather than another. For instance, did you know that astronomical units (AU) are typically used for within our Solar System? But the distance to our nearest star, Proxima Centauri, is so huge that we really do need to jump up to using either Light Years or Parsecs.

Although Kimberly went to a number of extremely elite schools (including Caltech and Princeton), she doesn't pretend to be perfect\u2014far from it! Rather, she'll explain all the ways she did everything wrong until she eventually figured out what actually works. \n \nThis book will especially resonate with you if school came easy to you early on, so you coasted by until SUDDENLY school got really hard. Now what? \nSmarter Studying Techniques to the rescue! \n\nOur study tips playlist is here: http://bit.ly/StudyTipsPlaylist\n\n#StudyTips #Book #Shorts",

But how do you know if a star is actually brighter, or just closer to you? Astronomers use a wide variety of terms to distinguish between how bright a star LOOKS to us, and how much light it is actually producing. These terms can be very confusing! But we'll help you figure it all out.\n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 CHAPTERS\nYou can jump to chapters in the video here:\n0:00 How bright are stars?\n0:22 Apparent Magnitude (Hipparchus & Ptolemy)\n3:00 Luminous Flux\n4:00 Inverse Square Law\n4:35 Intrinsic Brightness vs Apparent Brightness\n5:35 Solar Luminosities\n6:34 Absolute Magnitude\n8:07 Distance Modulus\n9:06 Standard Candles\n9:48 Cepheid Variable Stars \n\n\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735\u2735 THANKS TO OUR SOCRATICA FRIENDS\nMeet our VIP Patrons!

This video answers an important question\u2014WHY should you study Chemistry, especially if you\u2019re not planning on majoring in Chem. The truth is, Chemistry is a prerequisite for almost every STEM subject. Many fields of science, engineering, and medicine require a solid grounding in chemistry concepts. That\u2019s why Chemistry is often referred to as \u201cThe Central Science.\u201d\n\nIn this video we\u2019ll talk briefly about the history of the subject\u2014when did Chemistry actually start? And then we\u2019ll dive into the various ways learning Chemistry will help you in Astronomy, Biology, Geology, Physics, Engineering and Material Science, and more. Finally, we\u2019ll look at the ways the study of Chemistry can be organized into 5 major branches: organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry, physical chemistry, analytical chemistry, and biochemistry. Keep in mind, that isn\u2019t the one and only way to organize the subject, just one of the common ways you\u2019ll see the field subdivided. \n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nLESSON CHAPTERS:\n0:00 Introduction\u2014Chemistry seems random\n2:03 Alchemy\n4:56 Natural Philosophers (early chemists)\n6:05 Chemistry is the Central Science\n7:14 Chemistry in Biology\n10:09 Chemistry in Astronomy\n10:56 Chemistry in Geology\n11:31 Chemistry in Engineering\n12:40 Chemistry in Physics\n14:13 Branches of Chemistry\n15:03 Organic Chemistry\n15:31 Inorganic Chemistry\n15:53 Physical Chemistry\n16:28 Analytical Chemistry\n16:53 Biochemistry\n\nSUBSCRIBE so you never miss a video! \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nMORE Chemistry content on our website\nhttps://www.socratica.com/subject/chemistry\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nSUPPORT our channel:\nPatreon : https://www.patreon.com/socratica \nPayPal donation: https://www.paypal.me/socratica\nBitcoin : bc1qda47tgfyk67lxa7yqn8y5m02hjcglghsd5c58n\nThank you!\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nRECOMMENDED Books & Resources:\n\nSocratica Practice Tests: https://shop.socratica.com/collections/digital-content\nHow to Be a Great Student: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n239 pc Chemistry Molecules Model Kit: https://amzn.to/3DhlG3n\nBrown and LeMay Chemistry: The Central Science\n  14th edition: https://amzn.to/3fiLR1G\nMcGraw/Hill Chemistry by Chang & Goldsby  https://amzn.to/3UclbP3\nUncle Tungsten: Memories of a Chemical Boyhood by Oliver Sacks  https://amzn.to/3ffeRau\nNapoleon's Buttons: How 17 Molecules Changed History  https://amzn.to/3sIXuBW\n\n\u2b23\u2b23\u2b23\nWritten and Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nAbout our instructor:\nKimberly Hatch Harrison received degrees in Biology and English Literature from Caltech before working in pharmaceuticals research, developing drugs for autoimmune disorders.

Python provides the re module to assist you in your efforts to search through strings. Maybe you want to find names in a database that satisfy certain conditions. But before you charge right in and start throwing regular expressions around, you need to learn the correct syntax. \n\nIn this video, you\u2019ll learn how to compose regular expressions using such cryptic symbols as the caret (^), dollar sign ($), various backslashes (\\d, \\s, \\w), and more. And just wait \u2018til you see what happens when you start combining them into a powerful combo search expression. \n\nWe also introduce such concepts as quantifiers so you can see how many times you get a match. Match, that\u2019s another handy function, along with fullmatch. You\u2019ll learn how useful it can be to create groups to name certain parts of a regex. We could go on, but it makes more sense for you to watch the video and take notes. Then share it with a friend and have them take notes. Then you can compare your notes and see if you are in agreement. \nWe were able to bring you this video thanks to our generous Kickstarter backers!

Not just your bank, but EVERY app you use to buy your groceries, gas up your car, listen to music... Some of these seem more important\u2014more private\u2014than others. But the truth is, once you start getting careless with some of your passwords, you\u2019ve opened yourself up to cyber attacks. Be vigilant. Here are 5 simple ways to strengthen all your passwords\u2014from the mundane to the deeply important. \nLENGTH The longer the password, the harder it is to crack. \nCOMPLEXITY Don\u2019t use a simple word or phrase\nUNIQUENESS Every account deserves its own password. \nIT\u2019S NOT PERSONAL, IT\u2019S BUSINESS Avoid personal information. \nGET HELP a Password Manager will do a better job than you \nBONUS ADVICE - change all your passwords regularly\n\nThis is just the START of protecting your digital information.

Scholars pulled apart numbers - slicing and dicing them - looking for interesting properties which might explain things like why a month is ~28 days long. One approach involved looking at the divisors of an integer. Integers with a LOT of divisors were called \"abundant\". Those were very few were called \"deficient\".

We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: 2-factor authentication\nAs you might expect, there are TWO parts to 2-factor authentication. \n1) Something you know (like a password)\n2) Something you have (like a phone) to verify your identity.\nYou type in your password like normal, then you confirm that it\u2019s really you trying to sign in, usually through a text message or authenticator app. This one-two punch of cybersecurity makes it much harder for bad guys to steal access to your accounts. \nPassword theft is one of the most common forms of cyberattack, but with 2-factor authentication, even IF a hacker gets ahold of your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor. This increased peace of mind makes it well worth the extra time it takes to sign in. Many online services offer 2FA as an option, including Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, probably your bank\u2026\nAre there drawbacks? Well, it does usually mean that you\u2019re more dependent on your mobile device. If you lose your phone, that could mean\u2014at least temporarily\u2014 losing access to your accounts. You\u2019ll need to make sure there\u2019s a way to recover access, either through backup codes or some other account recovery process. \nAnd we don\u2019t want to lull you into a false sense of security. 2-factor authentication ISN\u2019T a 100% guarantee of safety. Attackers may still be able to bypass this kind of security by stealing your phone number through SIM swapping or other nefarious means. The bad guys are always out there, working overtime. But 2-factor authentication is one of the simplest and most effective ways to add an extra layer of protection to your online identity and personal data. \nSubscribing to Socratica means you\u2019ll Learn More about being CyberSecure.\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: Cover your Cam\nPeople around the world are catching on to this idea: you should put a cover on your webcam when you\u2019re not using it.\n\nWe\u2019ve all gotten pretty comfortable using our webcams to have virtual meetings with our friends, family, & coworkers. But when we hang up, could someone uninvited take a peek? \nHackers can gain access to your computer\u2019s camera in a variety of sneaky ways. They can exploit vulnerabilities in operating systems, applications, or firmware. These kinds of security flaws can allow bad guys to take control of your webcam remotely. \nYou might have even GIVEN them access to your webcam, because you granted permissions to an application you installed. \nOr maybe you clicked on a link in a phishing email, and you wound up downloading malware like Remote Access Trojans that lets them activate your webcam without your knowledge. RATS!\nAnd it\u2019s not just cybercriminals who want to spy on you. Governments, corporations, and even schools have been found to secretly access the camera on people's devices.\nNo matter what kind of spyware they\u2019re using, or who THEY are\u2014there\u2019s an easy fix. Unplug your external camera when you\u2019re not using it, or if it\u2019s built in, stick a piece of tape over it. You can even buy a cute little slider. Just close the door in their faces.

      "description": "If you've heard cybersecurity terms but you've been avoiding the topic, this microlearning course will help you get started. We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: Browser Fingerprinting \nOn the internet, nobody knows you\u2019re a dog. Or so the saying went until the cyber-spying-industrial-complex invented browser fingerprinting. You may think you\u2019re all incognito, flying under the radar. But the truth is, you\u2019re broadcasting your identity every time you use your computer. \nHere are a few things that can be tracked and used to identify you. Yes you, personally:\nYour IP address. Your computer has a unique ID that identifies it every time you connect to the web. It\u2019s just like back when you called an operator and said \u201cGive me Pennsylvania 6-5000.\u201d It\u2019s just a lot faster, and it\u2019s more like 128.242.245.116 \nYour computer setup. You always log in from that same laptop, with that same screen resolution and other hardware details\u2014CPU, GPU, touchscreen, etc.\u2014your language preferences, those specific plugins you installed. \nYour geolocation\u2014latitude and longitude\nThe font you\u2019re using, and how it renders on your machine\nThe way audio is processed\nYour battery status, including the level of charge and estimated time remaining\nEven slight variations in all these details add up to a unique identity. You. \nWhat simple steps can you take to safeguard your privacy?\nChoose a browser like Brave or Tor that has some built-in features to limit fingerprinting. \nUse a VPN. Virtual Private Networks can help mask your IP address and geolocation. \nToss those cookies. Regularly clearing your browser\u2019s history, cached data, and cookies reduces the amount of data that can be tracked. \nUse a protective plugin like uBlock Origin that blocks trackers.\nThere are even privacy-focused operating systems like Tails and Qubes OS that are designed to enhance privacy and security. \nNow most businesses WANT to track you, badly. So a lot of sites will just break if you use a VPN or a blocker to make it harder for websites to gather data. And we have to be honest with you here\u2014these basic anti fingerprinting measures can HELP keep your identity private. But it\u2019s like an arms race, and if someone REALLY wants to identify you, they can and will. But what do we know. We\u2019re just three owls in a trench coat. \nFollow Socratica for more cybersecurity knowledge. \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

      "description": "If you've heard cybersecurity terms but you've been avoiding the topic, this microlearning course will help you get started. We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: Toss your Cookies\nWhenever you visit a website, you\u2019ll be served up a fresh-from-the-oven plate of MAGIC COOKIES. These are small text files stored on your device, containing data such as your login info and user preferences. That\u2019s generally a GOOD thing. Imagine if you had to re-login to a website every time you went to a different page on the site. Or maybe you enjoy using dark mode on Friendface. What if that reset every time you clicked on a new profile? That would be pretty frustrating. So cookies do make using the web more pleasant.\nCookies are sooo sweet. They ask for your permission to be installed. By Law. These alerts are supposed to help us preserve our privacy. But do you really have a choice, if you need to install a cookie in order for a website to work properly? Be honest, you just click OK, right? Same here.\nMost of the time, first-party cookies are no big deal. They make the website work well, behaving as you wish, keeping you logged in, and keeping track of some useful analytics for the website owner. \nPrivacy concerns are usually more about THIRD-PARTY cookies. These come from other companies you didn\u2019t actually visit on purpose. Usually this is from an ad running on the page. This means advertisers can keep an eye on you, without your express permission. Depending on how many times your data is shared or sold, cookies can be used to build a comprehensive profile of your online activities.\nStill, nothing very sinister here, depending on your personal tolerance for user privacy and the ethics of data collection. Being served up personalized ads is a defining characteristic of the modern advertising landscape. \n\nBut even if we accept the tracking aspect, cookies do open the door for some more serious security breaches. These can include:\nCOOKIE THEFT. Hackers can use malware to steal cookies from your device. Then they can use them to gain unauthorized access to the websites you\u2019ve visited. \nSESSION HIJACKING.  If a cookie contains authentication tokens, and an attacker intercepts the cookie, they could impersonate you and, again, gain u nauthorized access to your account. \nCROSS-SITE SCRIPTING ATTACKS. In an XSS attack, malicious code is inserted into a vulnerable website, including its cookies. If you visit a compromised site, the malicious code could execute on your device, potentially leading to data theft or\u2014here it comes again\u2014unauthorized access.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution here? You can manage your browser preferences and limit the data you share when you accept cookies. There are also browser extensions that help you block cookies. But what\u2019s the easiest thing you can do? Clear your cookies\u2014regularly. It\u2019s just that simple.\n\nFor more servings of delicious cybersecurity knowledge, subscribe to Socratica.\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

They're related, but distinct ideas. \nIt helps to visualize a dart board.\n\ud83c\udfaf ACCURACY = how close your darts are to the target.\n\ud83d\udcca PRECISION = how close your darts are to each other. \n\nAnother way to think about PRECISION is when you use a tool to make measurements. The finer the markings, the more PRECISE it is. So a ruler marked in centimeters is less precise than a ruler marked in tenths of centimeters. The more precise the measurement, the more certain you can be that measurements will be close to each other. \n\n\ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udd89 RECOMMENDED BOOK\n\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6c \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude42\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69\n ebook: https://amzn.to/2Lh3XSP\n Paperback: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3 \n\n\u25b6\ufe0f WATCH NEXT\n\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude6e\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude69\n   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLi01XoE8jYoi-BCj5m0rRW03vqxaQrH7u\n\n\ud83c\udd7f\ufe0f SUPPORT OUR WORK\n\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\n https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nOur wonderful Patrons on Patreon make this work possible.

We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: More Secure Browsers\n\nWhen you go online, can spying eyes see what you\u2019re doing? Most standard browsers make it easy to track your every move. \n\u201cI don\u2019t have anything to hide\u201d is not really the answer here. You deserve to live your life without feeling like you\u2019re in a fishbowl. \nMaking the right choice of internet browser can help. Two popular options are Brave and Tor\u2014but there are many to choose from. You should look for one that has features you will benefit from. Here are some considerations to start with:\nSecurity Features, such as malware protection and strong encryption protocols.\nPrivacy Settings, that will allow you to control which information is collected, stored, and shared. \nOpen Source browsers are transparent and their code can be examined by security experts to identify and resolve any vulnerabilities.\nRegular Updates will ensure that security issues are promptly dealt with. This means you may be looking for a reputable vendor with a sizable developer team. But sometimes a strong user base can provide community support to deal with security-related concerns.\n\nAd Blockers\nA side benefit to using a more secure browser is that you won\u2019t be chased around the internet by ads. You looked at a lawnmower last month! Here are 30 to choose from! Really, how many lawnmowers does one person need? The answer is: zero. Plant a native wildflower garden instead! But buy your seeds using a secure internet browser, unless you want to hear about making tea from camomile and nettles for the rest of the year.\n\nTo get more help Leveling Up your cybersecurity, subscribe to Socratica\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: Making the Case for a Faraday Phone Case\nA Faraday Phone Case is the perfect accessory for the Cybersecurity Aware.  As you go out and about town, you can be confident no one is scanning your phone. \nBut how does it work?\nJust like the Faraday Cage it\u2019s named after, the Faraday Phone Case is made out of materials that have strong electromagnetic shielding. The primary material is often a woven metal fabric, such as copper or nickel-coated polyester. These metals have high conductivity and can effectively block electromagnetic signals.\n\nWhen you slip your phone into a Faraday case, it essentially becomes isolated from the outside world. \nThis translates to a number of benefits that will enhance your cybersecurity, including:\nSignal Blocking. The case prevents both incoming AND outgoing signals, including cellular, WiFi, Bluetooth, and NFC.\nSilent and Dark. You can maintain your privacy by preventing remote access to your phone\u2019s sensors including the microphone and camera. In other words, your device can\u2019t be used to spy on you. \nCyber Attacks. Faraday cases can help safeguard your phone against certain remote hacking techniques, such as mobile signal interception and relay attacks. \nRFID Skimming If you slip your credit cards and passport into the case, you also don\u2019t have to worry about someone skimming that personal information stored on the RFID chips, stealing your identity and your money.\nYou may have your security locked down at home, but it\u2019s another kind of challenge to be secure in public places. Especially when you\u2019re traveling, using a Faraday case adds an extra layer of security. GPS signals are blocked, which means your location is hidden. The case prevents your phone from connecting to unsecured networks, or being vulnerable to various cyber attacks. But remember, it\u2019s important to practice other safe digital habits as well, like using strong passwords and being cautious of suspicious links or downloads. \nLearn more about mitigating your cyber security risks by subscribing to Socratica: \nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

This is a useful technique from Natural Language Processing, a growing subfield of AI & Machine Learning. In this lesson, we review how to use the bag of words technique to turn a piece of text into a vector, then show how the 'cosine similarity' measure is a useful way to compare two docs. As a concrete application, we compare 10 different classic novels from different authors and time periods to see how well the cosine similarity measure performs.\n\n\ud835\ude54\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude5f\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5b \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:48 Prerequisites\n1:43 The Big Idea\n3:39 Cosine Similarity\n4:42 Example setup\n5:47 The Books\n6:51 Building a Feature Vector\n8:56 Writing the Functions\n10:08 Computing Cosine similarities\n11:30 No Stop Words\n12:50 Analysis\n14:00 No Nouns\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\nBag of Words\nhttps://youtu.be/kLMhePA3BiY\n\nUse Mathematica for Free\nhttps://youtu.be/rGzmG1uXklM\n\nBTW\u2014Socratica offers a pro course, 'Mathematica Essentials,' providing key concepts for mastering Wolfram products: \n   https://www.socratica.com/courses/mathematica-essentials\n\nThank you to our VIP Patreon Members who helped make this video possible! \nJos\u00e9 Juan Francisco Castillo Rivera\nKW\nM Andrews\nJim Woodworth\nMarcos Silveira\nChristopher Kemsley\nEric Eccleston\nJeremy Shimanek\nMichael Shebanow\nAlvin Khaled\nKevin B\nJohn Krawiec\nUmar Khan\nTracy Karin Prell\n \u2014 Thank you kind friends! \ud83d\udc9c\ud83e\udd89\n\n\u2737\u2737\u2737\nWe recommend the following (affiliate links):\nThe Wolfram Language\nhttps://amzn.to/3D4jqvz\n\nThe Mythical Man Month - Essays on Software Engineering & Project Management\n     http://amzn.to/2tYdNeP\n\nInnumeracy: Mathematical Illiteracy and Its Consequences\n     http://amzn.to/2ri1nf7\n\nMindset by Carol Dweck\n     https://amzn.to/2q9y8Nj\n\nHow to Be a Great Student (our first book!)\n   ebook: https://amzn.to/2Lh3XSP\n   Paperback: https://amzn.to/3t5jeH3\n   Kindle Unlimited: https://amzn.to/3atr8TJ\n\n\u2737\u2737\u2737\nIf you find our work at Socratica valuable, please consider becoming our Patron on Patreon!\n     https://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nIf you would prefer to make a one-time donation, you can also use\nSocratica Paypal\n      https://www.paypal.me/socratica\n\n\u2737\u2737\u2737\nWritten & Produced by Michael Harrison & Kimberly Hatch Harrison\nEdited by Megi Shuke\n\nAbout our Instructors:\n\nMichael earned his BS in Math from Caltech, and did his graduate work in Math at UC Berkeley and University of Washington, specializing in Number Theory.

We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: Privacy vs Cybersecurity\nYou don\u2019t have to be doing anything naughty to want PRIVACY. If you know, you know. If your parents ever read your diary when you were a kid, you know. If you feel uncomfortable when someone reads your phone over your shoulder\u2014you know. Privacy allows us to have our own thoughts without having to explain ourselves. It\u2019s a human right. \n\nIn modern terms, technological privacy is focused on DATA. It\u2019s less about hiding personal information, and more about how that data is collected, or shared. Can we control what happens to our data. Privacy doesn\u2019t mean simply locking up your data and throwing away the key. It\u2019s more about consent, and trust. Do you trust a company to respect your wishes with regards to your data, to maintain confidentiality, and prevent unauthorized surveillance? \n\nPrivacy measures include informed consent for data collection, implementing data protection policies, and complying with privacy regulations.\n\nCybersecurity is a related but distinct concept. It\u2019s HOW you go about protecting your data. It involves such measures as controlling who has access to your data. Then, encrypting your data, so it may be safely stored or transferred. Furthermore, cybersecurity includes efforts to protect not just your personal data assets, but also various operations, networks, and organizations that would be disrupted by cybercrime. \n\nOther cybersecurity measures include VPNs, firewalls, strong passwords and other authentication methods, detection of security breaches, regular security updates, and more.\n\nSo you see, privacy and cybersecurity are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. We need cybersecurity to maintain data privacy, by preventing unauthorized access to personal data. And by protecting sensitive information, privacy measures contribute to cybersecurity\u2019s ability to fend off a wide variety of cyber-crimes.\n\nSubscribe to Socratica for more microlessons about our digital landscape:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We're adding fast lessons, quizzes, and more to this course here: https://www.socratica.com/courses/cybersecurity\n\nToday\u2019s Cybersecurity Lesson: Using a VPN\nA Virtual Private Network is a secure and private connection that encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a remote server. It\u2019s a pretty powerful tool that addresses the two biggest cyber-issues: VPNs allow you to be more private AND more secure. \nPRIVACY:  A VPN enhances your online privacy through a variety of mechanisms, including masking your IP address, which makes it difficult for anyone to identify you or track your online activities. A VPN allows you to use public WiFi anonymously, and to keep your browsing habits private, no matter where you actually are in the world. As a bonus, by changing your apparent location, a VPN may allow you access to geo-restricted content that might be otherwise unavailable. \nSECURITY: Using a VPN also provides an additional layer of security by encrypting your data. This helps prevent hackers from intercepting and accessing your sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data. \n\nKeep in mind there can be some downsides to using a VPN. \nSPEED:  VPN use often comes with reduced internet speed, since it involves encrypting and routing your internet traffic through remote servers. \nCOST:  While there are free VPN services available, Premium VPNs generally offer better performance and enhanced features\u2026for a fee. \nCOMPATIBILITY: Some applications and services may not work properly when you\u2019re connected to a VPN. In fact, some websites actively block VPN connections. \nLEGAL ISSUES: Depending on your jurisdiction, there may be legal restrictions and regulations governing the use of VPNs. \n \nIf you choose to use a VPN, consider these factors, as well as how trustworthy is the VPN itself. Choose a reputable VPN provider, since you\u2019re using them to handle your internet traffic and your private information.\n\nTo continue receiving good advice about cybersecurity, subscribe to Socratica:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series was made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We believe it's never to late to learn! We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nIn this video, we discuss setting FINANCIAL GOALS. You may be surprised that the most important thing is to make your goals YOUR goals, not the goals other people think you should have. By making your financial goals personal, you give them  much greater power. \nWe discuss ways to break down your financial goals to make them more achievable, starting with picking reasonable goals, right from the start. It's also important to be aware of the different timeframes for different financial goals. Some may be short term, within the year. Or you may be focusing on something much farther off, like retirement. This will influence how you approach this challenge. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Your Financial Goals should be PERSONAL\n1:01 Choose a SPECIFIC goal\n1:25 Choose a MEASURABLE goal\n1:52 AUTOMATE your savings\n2:27 Make BUDGET cuts\n3:06 Set a DEADLINE\n3:50 Celebrate MILESTONES\n4:15 Why not use a CREDIT CARD?\n5:01 Types of financial goals\n5:45 Homework assignment\n7:52 Creating a budget\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\nWealth Made Easy (advice from Millionaires & Billionaires)\nhttps://amzn.to/3yczvSb\n\nBudget Planner & Monthly Bill Organizer\nhttps://amzn.to/3WOXoZr\n\nTo continue receiving good advice about personal finance, subscribe to Socratica:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series is made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We believe it's never to late to learn! We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nIn this video, we discuss setting BANKING basics. It's one of those things we're all familiar with. Seems like there's a bank on every corner! But what really happens there? What role do banks play in Personal Finance? \nDo you get paid at your job? Then you'll need a checking account so you can cash those checks (or deposit them).When you get a checking account, they'll give you a debit card (or ATM card) that will let you pay for things electronically.  For larger purchases, you may need to write checks. So you can see that a checking account covers most of your day-to-day money needs. \nFor longer term, you may want to open a savings account. We'll talk about the differences between these two kinds of bank accounts. And here's a big thing to keep in mind: why do banks offer all these services? What's in it for them? Well, they make money by using your money to invest, to loan to other people (and make interest), and also if you make mistakes, they'll charge you fees and penalties. We have a special mini-lesson at Socratica.com so you see the different ways Banks make money. \nhttps://www.socratica.com/products/digital_downloads/how-banks-make-money\n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00  Intro - like a digital wallet\n1:06 What is a Savings Account?\n2:25 What is a Checking Account\n3:30 Account number & routing number\n4:08 Using Checks/ Cheques\n5:30 Balance your checkbook\n6:18 Overdraft fees\n7:07 Making deposits & withdrawals\n8:14 How do Banks Make Money?\n9:25 What if the bank fails?\n9:57 Banks are insured FDIC, FSCS\n11:04 Recap - the role of banks in Personal finance\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\nSetting Financial Goals https://youtu.be/iqQlrF5-IJg\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\nWealth Made Easy (advice from Millionaires & Billionaires)\nhttps://amzn.to/3yczvSb\n\nBudget Planner & Monthly Bill Organizer\nhttps://amzn.to/3WOXoZr\n \nTo continue receiving good advice about personal finance, subscribe to Socratica:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series is made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We believe it's never to late to learn! We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nIn this video, we discuss your two big options for making purchases other than using cash: Debit or Credit. What's the smart choice, here? \nFirst, we'll make clear what each of these options are. A debit card offers you access to your own money. It's in an electronic form, so you can buy things online, unlike with cash. Meanwhile, a credit card is essentially a loan\u2014with very bad terms if you don't pay your bill in full at the end of the month. \nThere are advantages and disadvantages to both. There's far less risk of going into debt when you use your debit card. But using a credit card is a convenient way to make those big purchases you need (like computers, appliances for your home, plane tickets) without having to have that much cash money on hand immediately. You can also build your credit when you use your credit card. \nBut there's a big downside to credit cards. If you can't pay off your credit card in full, you'll be charged interest based on the balance due. And that's a fast way to get into debt. \nTo avoid any issues with either, we end the video with some tips on how to use these tools responsibly. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Buying concert tickets online\n0:36 What is a Debit Card?\n1:25 What is a Credit Card?\n2:29 Key Differences\n3:21 Spending Limits\n4:21 Credit Score Impacts\n5:16 Debit Card Advantages\n5:42 Debit Card Disadvantages\n6:19 Credt Card Advantages\n6:51 Credit Card Disadvantages\n7:34 How do you pick which to use?\n8:33 Tips for Smart Use of debit & credit\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\nSetting Financial Goals https://youtu.be/iqQlrF5-IJg\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\nWealth Made Easy (advice from Millionaires & Billionaires)\nhttps://amzn.to/3yczvSb\n\nBudget Planner & Monthly Bill Organizer\nhttps://amzn.to/3WOXoZr\n \nTo continue receiving good advice about personal finance, subscribe to Socratica:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series is made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nIt's easy to overspend when you have a credit card, or even go into debt. In this video, we discuss how you can be smart about using credit cards as a financial tool to manage your money.\nIt starts with understanding the pros and cons. Some of the CONS include having to pay interest, fees and penalties, and the increased risk of going into debt.\nBut there are some reas PROS to using credit cards as well! These include great convenience and safety. You don't have to carry around huge wads of cash, and even if someone uses your card fraudulently, you are protected by credit card insurance so you don't have to pay the false charges. It's also a way to build your credit history. \nIf, after weighing the pros and cons, you decide to apply for a card, we'll talk about what that process involves. And then once you have a credit card, what you can expect every month from your statement and the billing cycle. \n\nOne important piece of advice we hope you will take is that it really helps your financial health if you don't make just the minimum payment on your credit card balance.

We believe it's never to late to learn! We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nGoing to college used to be much less common than it is now. Used to be, you went to college if you were very well off already. But nowadays, we're strongly encouraged to go to college if we can, to improve our future job prospects. And if we can't afford it, no big deal, just take out a GIANT LOAN even though you don't have any credit history or work history or meaningful income because you are, after all, a student fresh out of high school. \nDoes this sound like a good idea? \nIt really doesn't, but what's the alternative? \nHaving a college degree, while not a guarantee of future financial success, does increase your odds of doing well. So with that in mind, in this video we discuss ways you can minimize the impact of this major, major investment.  \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:31 True Cost of Education\n1:28 Save $ with Community College\n3:08 Save $ with AP Classes\n4:46 Countries with Student Loans\n6:04 Understanding Interest Payments\n7:11 Tax Deductions\n8:11 Loan Term\n8:26 Benefits of Faster Payment\n9:47 What if you Can't Pay\n11:05 How do Colleges & Universities offer loans\n12:15 What's the real cost of a $200K loan?\n\n\nQuick Exercise: What's the Cost of Interest? \nLINK COMING SOON\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\nSetting Financial Goals https://youtu.be/iqQlrF5-IJg\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\nWealth Made Easy (advice from Millionaires & Billionaires)\nhttps://amzn.to/3yczvSb\n\nBudget Planner & Monthly Bill Organizer\nhttps://amzn.to/3WOXoZr\n \nTo continue receiving good advice about personal finance, subscribe to Socratica:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series is made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.

There are also a variety of tools out there to help, including apps you can try. We're not endorsing any particular app, because what works well for us might not be as good a fit for you.

We believe it's never to late to learn! We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nYou've learned how to make a budget and stick to it. Now what do you do with the surplus you have left over each month? The two big options are saving it in a savings account, or investing in it. What's the SMART MONEY move here? \nSavings accounts are great for when you want access to that money in a short period of time. They're even insured by FDIC! But the trade-off here is that you won't make very much money. In fact, that means it's very likely you're losing money in the long run, because there's always inflation. \nSo what about investing? If you invest in the stock market, especially the average stock market through using index funds, you can expect something around a 10% return. The trade-off is risk. Your investment in the stock market is NOT insured. This is less of a problem for long-term investing. We also discuss other ways to lower the risk of investing in the stock market, including diversification (don't invest all of your money in just a few stocks, or even just one sector or one country). Another way to spread your risk is to buy a little bit of stock regularly, using a technique called \"dollar cost averaging.\" \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro savings vs investing apple farm metaphor\n0:57 How safe are savings accounts?

We believe it's never to late to learn! We're all about Lifelong Learning here at Socratica, and we are here to help you increase your Financial Literacy. \nThe theme of SMART MONEY is making informed choices.\n\nUh oh. Did it happen again?\nDid you wait until the last minute to buy holiday gifts?\nWe know you're interested in getting a handle on your personal finance. And while you may have diligently set your financial goals, and created a budget, you're getting derailed several times a year because a surprise sneaks up on you like birthdays, anniversaries, and the Holiday season. \nExcept those aren't really surprises, are they? \nLet's take a look at why this keep happening, and why you feel compelled to overcompensate by spending too much money doing last-minute shopping. By understanding the psychology of gifting, and with a little more planning and thinking ahead, you can avoid unnecessary financial shocks. We also suggest ways to make some creative and thoughtful choices for gifts that don't have to be very expensive.  \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro - Anthropology of Gifts\n1:04 Psychology of Gifting\n2:43 Financial Planning for Gifts\n4:02 Strategic Gift Buying\n5:18 Collaborative Gifting\n6:11 Thoughtful Alternatives\n7:28 Give the Gift of Patreon\n7:47 Practical Advice\n8:58 Minimalism\n9:32 Courses\n9:56 Special Occasions & Traditions\n11:05 Balance great gifts and financial responsibility\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\nIntro to Budgeting\n https://youtu.be/8nZNwOd0Stc\n\nSetting Financial Goals \n  https://youtu.be/iqQlrF5-IJg\n\nQuick Exercise: What's the Cost of Interest? \nLINK COMING SOON\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\nWealth Made Easy (advice from Millionaires & Billionaires)\nhttps://amzn.to/3yczvSb\n\nBudget Planner & Monthly Bill Organizer\nhttps://amzn.to/3WOXoZr\n \nTo continue receiving good advice about personal finance, subscribe to Socratica:\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaSubscribe\n\nSupport Socratica on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/socratica\n\nThis video series is made possible by the generous support of our Patrons on Patreon.
