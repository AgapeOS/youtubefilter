      "description": "Is it always wrong for Christians (or anybody, for that matter) to make moral judgments? Christians typically face pushback when speaking on issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, and & \"trans\" rights from a biblical worldview.

This week he'll be going through Session #2: '3 Reasons You Shouldn\u2019t (& Can\u2019t) \"Follow Your Heart\"'.\n\nFrank will reveal the three reasons why you shouldn\u2019t follow your heart, and why it\u2019s actually impossible to do so consistently even if you wanted to. According to Frank, this is the second most important message for people today to hear (especially young people). You\u2019ll see that this message can save you from a lot of pain and suffering, and it\u2019s based on good reason, experience, and the second most important verse in the Bible. \n\n00:00 - Intro \n3:42 - Presentation \n1:00:20 - Did Frank catch Billy Graham on Woody Allen's TV show? \n1:01:35 - Do trans people ever rapidly revert back to their original gender? \n1:03:25 - How can you tell if you're listening to the Spirit or listening to your own heart? \n1:09:15 - How should pastors hypothetically approach gay couples in church? \n1:19:00 - Why do so many Christians refuse to vote? \n1:22:15 - How do you engage Christians who refuse to vote for Trump because of his personality? \n1:25:16 - How do you talk to liberal Christians who don't believe in Bible inerrancy?\n1:29:59 - Is it possible for Christians to never sin?\n1:31:01 - Which books would Frank recommend for discipleship?\n1:32:20 - If God exists and there's so much evidence for Him, why am I struggling to believe in Him?",

There\u2019s no need to speculate--history provides several shocking examples. Join Frank and Historian Bill Federer on THURS. 10/3 at 9:00 PM ET as they expose those examples and show how the United States and Western Europe are heading for a cultural, civic, and religious catastrophe unless they change course NOW!\n\nAlong the way they will address these questions (and take your questions):\n\n-- What has mass immigration done for the Roman Empire, Beirut, Minneapolis, London, Paris, California, and other places?\n-- Are borders biblical, and if so, what is their purpose?\n-- Shouldn\u2019t Christians be for immigration? Aren\u2019t open borders compassionate?\n-- Doesn\u2019t mass immigration provide an opportunity for evangelism?\n-- Why are there no migrant caravans going TO Venezuela?\n-- How many people can the U.S. reasonably take in, and what difference will it make to alleviate world poverty?\n-- Why has the U.S. been paying people to come here and then giving them benefits citizens don\u2019t get?\n-- Why has the U.S. southern border been open during the Harris-Biden administration?\n-- Is it racist to want the border secure?\n-- Do we need new legislation to fix the problem?\n-- What would Bill Federer do if he were President and why?\n\nWe will also take your questions from the chat. Don\u2019t miss this extremely important reveal and discussion!\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Intro  \n7:40 - What is the purpose of government and borders?\n12:12 - How have societies historically transitioned from socialism to communism?\n15:12 - Whose responsibility is it to take care of the poor? \n16:50 - Are borders biblical? \n20:54 - Is it compassionate to have open borders?\n28:33 - What happens when immigration is uncontrolled? \n47:46 - What is the political agenda behind mass immigration? \n1:02:16 - What was Jimmy Carter\u2019s contribution to world politics?\n1:10:28 - Does America have the capacity to solve world poverty through immigration? [Roy Beck Gumballs Illustration]\n1:20:33 - What about immigrants who fill jobs that locals are unwilling to fulfill? Won't that promote prosperity?\n1:27:10 - Will my vote count? \n1:30:45 - How has Christianity historically impacted the prosperity of different countries?",

      "description": "Is the American Church still shining as the light of Christ, or have we made too many compromises in the name of \"tolerance\" and \"inclusion\"? As darkness in our nation grows, it\u2019s becoming clear that the faith of many has become cloudy and confused, leading to the rise of secularism and threats to the freedoms once rooted in the Christian worldview. Where are we headed, and what lessons from the past should serve as warnings for our future?\n\nThis week, Frank sits down with the one and only Dr. Erwin Lutzer about his brand new book, 'The Eclipse of God', which explores how America is attempting to redefine God, replacing Him with one made in our image.

      "description": "If politics isn't your thing or you've lost your enthusiasm to vote this year, you REALLY need to tune in! Frank dedicates this podcast episode to focusing on the top three questions that Christians need to consider when it comes to \"religion and politics\" and what history has taught us when Christians disengage from the world of politics and choose not to vote. He also summarizes some of the helpful information you'll find available at VoteYourFaith.net by addressing questions and issues like:\n\n-- What are the consequences when Christians don't vote?\n-- How was Jesus involved in politics, and how does that help us vote?\n-- If a politician can\u2019t save you, why vote at all? (Sorry, but you\u2019ll see why this is a really stupid objection!)\n-- Does abortion trump everything else?\n-- Where do both parties stand on \"the more important matters of the law\"?\n-- Should Christians vote for the most good or the least evil?\n-- What is the Equality Act and how could it hurt our children, our jobs, and our religious freedoms?\n-- Why you\u2019re actually not voting for one person!\n\nGod has used both righteous and unrighteous leaders all through the Bible to accomplish His good purposes, so get informed, go vote, and leave the results to God!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nHelpful Resources and Local Voting Guide: http://VoteYourFaith.net\nGeorge Barna on The Charlie Kirk Show: https://apple.co/4eQeAEk\nDavid Daleiden & Planned Parenthood video: https://bit.ly/3BFt6jQ\nNew York Post article on Kamala Harris & Planned Parenthood: https://bit.ly/483XgcC\nNew York Post article on FEMA \"Disaster Equity\": https://bit.ly/3zT22Nr\nThe Heritage Foundation Explains The Equality Act: https://herit.ag/3Y07Z31\nThe Washington Stand: For the 41 Million Christians 'Unlikely' to Vote: https://bit.ly/3BItiPh\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "Why do so many Christians find it acceptable to stay silent in the face of evil? Historian Bill Federer joins Frank to discuss his latest book, 'Silence Equals Consent: The Sin of Omission' to discuss the Church's history of political indifference and explore why now, more than ever, Christians must engage with the world to preserve (religious) freedom.\n\nTogether, they tackle key questions, including:\n-- How did God address globalism in the Bible?\n-- What subtle tactics has Satan used to keep Christians silent?\n-- How did America\u2019s founders draw inspiration from ancient Israel's covenant government?\n-- What happens when Christians stop speaking up and lose their influence in society?\n-- How should Romans 13 be interpreted in a self-governing republic versus a monarchy?\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nResources mentioned during the episode:\nBilli's book: https://www.amazon.com/dp/1736959077\nBill's website: https://americanminute.com/\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

Conservative commentator and Christian author, Allie Beth Stuckey, joins Frank to talk about the inspiration behind her brand new book, 'Toxic Empathy', which explores real life examples of how compassion has been weaponized against Christians, ultimately shaming evangelicals into supporting and celebrating policies that violate the Christian worldview.\nDuring their conversation, Frank and Allie will answer questions like:\n\n-- What are the 5 main issues that Allie tackles in the book?\n-- How is toxic empathy causing Christians to become blind to the false narratives that are being promoted through secular media?\n-- What events awakened Allie to the reality of toxic empathy invading evangelicalism?\n-- How has God's view of justice been distorted by the social justice movement?\n-- What unique approach did Allie take in introducing each chapter that will help readers to show compassion towards the stories mentioned in the book?\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nAllie's Book: https://ToxicEmpathy.com\nAllie's Website: https://AllieBethStuckey.com\nHelpful Resources and Local Voting Guide: https://VoteYourFaith.net\nDoes Jesus Trump Your Politics? https://bit.ly/48eRJzP\nIs It Wrong for Christians to Call Out Shepherds? https://bit.ly/3zTC7W3\nShepherds for Sale with Megan Basham: https://bit.ly/4hdo5Py\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "Can you believe in biblical inerrancy AND hold to the old earth creation model? There's been an intramural debate brewing between old earth and young creationists, and some evangelical scholars say it's time to rethink the bedrock doctrine of biblical inerrancy in order for Christianity to remain viable in the intellectual sphere. But what do the Scriptures, along with what we can observe scientifically, reveal about creation and the age of the earth?\n\nAstrophysicist and Christian apologist, Dr. Hugh Ross, joins Frank from the SES 2024 Steadfast conference to discuss questions like:\n\n-- How does science demonstrate that there was a creation event?\n-- Is Genesis 1 a polemic against the Egyptian creation story?\n-- Does the Bible leave the age of the earth as indeterminate?\n-- When was Adam created and what does Dr. Ross think of William Lane Craig's view of the historical Adam?\n-- Does a person's belief about the age of the earth affect their salvation?\n-- How do young earth creations address the scientific evidence for an old earth?\n-- Did God artificially age the universe?\n-- What about neanderthals?\n-- Should Genesis 1-11 be interpreted differently than the rest of the book?\n\nWhether you're a young or old earth creationist, this podcast episode will be packed with plenty of information that could challenge or bring clarity to your perspective on when and how God created the universe.\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\nRESCUING INERRANCY (BOOK): https://a.co/d/7p9qKeX\nHUGH ROSS' MINISTRY: https://reasons.org/\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#podcast",

      "description": "Why are some prominent biologists and macro-evolutionists admitting that Darwinian evolution is in trouble and what\u2019s fueling this newfound skepticism? Dr. Casey Luskin, co-author of 'The Comprehensive Guide to Science and Faith', joins Frank to examine the flaws in macroevolutionary theory that even staunch materialists are finding hard to overlook. Together, they address the following questions:\n\n-- What are some key differences between micro and macroevolution?\n-- What did later research reveal about the Gal\u00e1pagos Island finches and how does it compare to Darwin's findings?\n-- What is epigenetics and how does it relate to the case for Intelligent Design?\n-- Why are some biologists hesitant to openly share their doubts about Neo-Darwinism, while others are increasingly vocal?\n-- What's the difference between Darwinism and Neo-Darwinism?\n-- What are the strongest arguments for a common ancestor?\n-- Are non-coding regions of the human genome really \"junk DNA\"?\n-- What about the God of the Gaps argument?\n-- Are proponents of Intelligent Design religiously motivated?\n-- What are the 4 basic L.I.F.E. problems found within macroevolutionary theory?\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nLearn more from Dr. Casey Luskin: https://caseyluskin.com/\nThe Comprehensive Guide to Science and Faith: https://a.co/d/fku8uAc\nWhy the Royal Society Meeting Mattered, in a Nutshell: https://bit.ly/3YjWBiK\nDigital Voting Guide and Excellent Presentations on Why Christians Should Vote: https://voteyourfaith.net/\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "Don\u2019t think the government will ever take your child? Think again. Laura Bryant Hanford, contributing writer to The Federalist, returns to the podcast to expose how the government is overriding your parental rights and harming children both mentally and physically in the name of \"trans-rights\". Once you hear some of these heartbreaking horror stories happening in America (like Abigail Maritinez from California), you\u2019ll be reminded of the importance of policy, and how Christians and all people should love their neighbors enough to prevent future generations from experiencing this madness!\nDuring their discussion, Frank and Laura will address questions like:\n\n-- How often and in what states are children being taken away from their parents?\n-- What are some specific examples of this happening in the U.S.?\n-- Why are some doctors hiding the most recent research data on the effects of \u201cgender-affirming care\u201d on children?\n-- Where do the candidates stand on this issue?\n-- Why is the Biden-Harris administration suing the state of Tennessee?\n-- Who is advocating to lower the age of consent, and how would that change what's taught in public schools?\n-- How would the misnamed \u201cEquality Act\u201d impact our religious freedoms?\n-- What kind of impact has the Biden-Harris administration made on the foster care system?\n-- What can parents do if they find themselves in a situation where the government wants to take their child?\n\nPlease check out the references below for confirmation and details of what Frank and Laura discuss.

God's Word has wisdom for us on all the big issues\u2014government, leadership, rebellion, sovereignty, anxiety, and prayer. Listen as Frank encourages listeners with Scripture from both the Old and New Testaments and talks about what it means to vote with a biblical perspective. He'll dig into questions like:\n\n-- Are borders biblical? And how does illegal immigration impact American housing?\n-- What's the solution to a divided nation?\n-- What's God's purpose for government?\n-- Is it ever right to peacefully disobey the government?\n-- How should Christians respond if our preferred candidate loses?\n-- How can we love our neighbors through politics?\n\nWith the country divided, we need a spiritual revival now more than ever. Let's prepare our hearts, pray for our leaders, and make our voices heard at the polls!\n\nResources mentioned during the episode:\nHelpful Resources and Voting Guides: https://voteyourfaith.net/\nThe Democrats\u2019 Insanity Defense: https://bit.ly/4ffepmy",

Together, Frank and Tim explore questions like:\n\n-- How do we know that God's promises to Israel actually came true?\n-- What's the inspiration behind the film, and who are some of the BIG names that Tim was able to interview in the film?\n-- Is there a way to verify Old Testament prophecy?\n-- Why did the Tel Dan stele discovery shake up the archaeological world and critics of the Bible?\n-- What evidence is there inside and outside Israel that the kingdom was destroyed?\n-- Why do some of the criticisms against Bible prophecy fall flat?\n-- Are there still biblical prophecies that need to be fulfilled?\n\nThen, stick around for the second half of the episode as Frank reflects on the election\u2019s implications with insights from our friend and fellow Unshaken speaker, Natasha Crain.\n-- How should we conduct ourselves with those who are upset with the results?\n-- What if they claim to be Christians?\n-- Why are some \"Progressive\" Christians puzzled by evangelical support for Trump?\n-- Is character the main deciding factor when voting for someone?\n-- Is choosing to follow Christ the ONLY important decision we need to make as Christians?\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\nGet Your Tickets for 'The Israel Dilemma'! -https://bit.ly/3UGQRP4\nKamala Harris's Top Priority: Killing Unborn Babies - https://bit.ly/48IuOgw\nNatasha Crain on Christians Voting for Trump - https://bit.ly/48Ezapa\nIs It Wrong to Call Out Shepherds? - https://bit.ly/3zTC7W3\nJosh Howerton's Advice for Christians After the Election - https://bit.ly/40yBV9x\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "This week on the podcast, CrossExamined board member Dan Hodges sits down with New Testament scholar and resurrection expert, Dr. Gary Habermas, for an in-depth exploration of the Shroud of Turin. In their discussion, Dan and Dr. Habermas examine the complex history and preservation of the Shroud, digging into why it has captivated both scholars and skeptics for decades. Together, they\u2019ll tackle questions such as:\n\n-- What are the most crucial questions for assessing the Shroud\u2019s authenticity?\n-- Could the burial cloth of Jesus truly have survived for nearly 2,000 years?\n-- What evidence supports or refutes the theory that the Shroud was created in the Middle Ages? Could it depict someone other than Jesus?\n-- How do non-biblical sources, archaeology, and medical research contribute to our understanding of crucifixion practices?\n-- What kind of event could have imprinted the image of a 6 ft., 180 lb. man on this ancient cloth?\n\nAs Dr. Habermas unpacks over 40 years of Shroud research, discover why this remarkable artifact continues to be a point of discussion in Christian apologetics and Church history.\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nGary's website: https://garyhabermas.com/\nOn the Resurrection, Volume 1 (Evidences) : https://a.co/d/1iufB8j\nOn the Resurrection, Volume 2 (Refutations): https://a.co/d/8O4Yc78\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#podcast",

      "description": "Why do people remain shocked that a majority of Christians (and the nation) voted for Donald Trump? How is that voting like Jesus? This week, Frank invites Pastor Josh Howerton of Lakepointe Church in Dallas, TX to talk about Josh's recent (and somewhat controversial!) political sermon, 'How to Vote Like Jesus'.\n\nDuring the podcast, Frank asks Pastor Josh to answer questions like:\n\n-- What kind of feedback did he receive after his politically charged sermon?\n-- What are the three types of leaders that we find in the Bible and how do they relate to the recent presidential election?\n-- Who is at the top of the Political Org Chart in America, and why do Christians have a responsibility to be involved?\n-- What is the key difference between the current Democrat and Republican platforms that some Christians are overlooking?\n-- Is the Church becoming more political? Or have politics become more spiritual?\n-- Is it really necessary for Christians to vote if both candidates are morally corrupt?\n-- How can pastors effectively disciple their congregations in the area of politics?\n-- How do you respond when someone accuses you of trying to legislate morality as a Christian?\n\nNow that the election is behind us, will the American Church take advantage of God's extension of mercy on our country? Or will we once again drift into complacency? All this and more will be discussed in this entertaining and educational podcast episode!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nFollow Pastor Josh on Instagram:\u00a0https://www.instagram.com/josh_howerton/\nPastor Josh's sermon 'How to Vote Like Jesus':\u00a0https://youtu.be/SitsLDo6X_Y\nLakepointe Church in Dallas, TX:\u00a0https://lakepointe.church/\nCalvin Robinson's Oxford Union Speech:\u00a0https://youtu.be/ymbTb2HS5Rc\nGeorge Barna article on 2024 Election Results:\u00a0https://bit.ly/3YRHopn\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

This week he'll be going through Session #5: 'If God, Why Evil? - Part 2'\n\nDuring this session he'll continue addressing the following questions: Does evil disprove God? If not, what is God\u2019s purpose for evil? Why would a good God allow evil that seems to have no purpose? And what is God\u2019s ultimate solution to evil? There will also be time for Q&A from the chat as well. \n\n0:00 - Welcome screen\n3:29 - Intro\n15:50 - Does evil disprove God?\n23:45 - What's the purpose of evil?\n34:44 - What about purposeless evil?\n45:17 - What's God solution to evil?\n1:08:30 - How do you define and measure what is truly evil?\n1:12:53 - Why don't Christianity, Judaism, and Islam all believe in the same creator?\n1:24:49 - Why did God allow Job to suffer if He didn\u2019t need to prove anything to Satan?\n1:29:51 - How is it just for Hitler to go to heaven while Anne Frank suffers in Hell?",

      "description": "How can exploring doubts strengthen your faith as a Christian? Dr. Ben Shaw and Dr. Ron Davis from CORE Apologetics join CrossExamined Board Member, Dan Hodges, to share how their new ministry is training up a new wave of apologists, how they're making disciples, engaging Gen Z, and helping believers and skeptics tackle their doubts. During the conversation, they\u2019ll answer questions like:\n\n-- What are the three types of doubt and why is it important to identify the type of doubt that a person may be dealing with?\n-- What has the latest Barna research uncovered about Gen Z's interest in religion?\n-- Why are young people beginning to lose faith in social media?\n-- Why is it important to have an intellectual and emotional confidence in the Gospel? And what is the value in learning New Testament reliability?\nCurious to learn more about CORE\u2019s mission and how you can support their work?

      "description": "If you say the wrong thing about race, even innocently, there's a pretty good chance you'll be convicted and cancelled in the court of public opinion and maybe even the church. In fact, the election revealed a divide between ethnic groups in the church. So how can we come together as Christians to discuss this controversial issue without losing friendships in the process?\n\nThis week on the podcast, Frank is joined by two people who are no strangers to difficult conversations when it comes to race and religion, Monique Duson and Krista Bontrager, co-founders of The Center for Biblical Unity and co-authors of the brand-new and much anticipated book, 'Walking in Unity: Biblical Answers to Questions on Race and Racism.' Together, Frank, Monique, and Krista tackle the following questions:\n\n-- Why has the black community historically voted for Democrats?\n-- Why did more black men vote for Republicans in this past presidential election?\n-- What's the historical connection between slavery and abortion?\n-- Why is equating race to LGBTQ+ issues a fallacy?\n-- What does Darwinism have to do with racism?\n-- Where did the concept of \"race\" originally come from and is it biblical?\n-- What's the definition of systemic racism and how is it different from systematic racism?\n-- Why is defining our terms so important?\n-- Why do we see such a high percentage of black men committing crimes and going to prison? Is systemic racism to blame?\n-- What is the ultimate solution to all of this?\n\nYou may be tempted to avoid the subject of race and racism at all costs during your everyday conversations, but as Christians we have a moral obligation to walk towards problems and not away from them. As you listen to the program, you'll be encouraged by Monique and Krista as they discuss with grace and clarity the tough issues that the larger culture has brought into our churches. Be sure to grab a copy of their book, 'Walking in Unity', for an even more in-depth look at these issues along with clear and concise explanations for why we're all brothers and sisters in the family of Christ!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nThe Center for Biblical Unity: https://www.centerforbiblicalunity.com/\nWalking in Unity: Biblical Answers to Questions on Race and Racism: https://a.co/d/hEuCdwe\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "Are you dreading the upcoming holiday dinners where you'll be in close proximity with friends, family, and loved-ones who aren't Christians? Let\u2019s face it\u2014holiday gatherings with friends and family who don't share your worldview can feel awkward. But they\u2019re also incredible opportunities to share the Gospel! If you're in search of some practical tips to make faith conversations a little less painful this Thanksgiving and Christmas, listen up!\n\nIn this week's podcast, Frank shares 10 practical strategies to help you navigate holiday faith conversations with confidence and without making a scene. He'll answer questions like:\n-- Are you setting realistic goals for sharing your faith?\n-- Why is listening often more impactful than debating?\n-- What role should prayer play when evangelizing?\n-- What are 3 tactical questions that you can ask and what common objections should you anticipate?\n-- How can you combat scientism and logical fallacies when they arise? And how should you respond if politics comes up?\n\nAs tempting as it may be, don't be a homebody or a couch potato this year!

      "description": "Did the Exodus REALLY happen? Contrary to popular belief, archaeologists continue to uncover fascinating artifacts that point to the validity of the Israelites' Exodus from Egypt and even more incredible\u2014some of the most compelling evidence comes straight out of Egypt itself!\n\nIn preparation for Frank\u2019s upcoming trip to Egypt and Saudi Arabia, this podcast episode dives into 8 reasons why we can trust the biblical account of the 1446 B.C. Exodus and some of the details might surprise you! Listen as Frank answers questions like:\n\n-- What archaeological evidence suggests that the Hebrews lived in Egypt prior to 1446 B.C.?\n-- Does the biblical account of the Exodus line up with the archaeological evidence?\n-- What do some of the Egyptian sources reveal about the historicity of the Bible?\n-- What are the surprising parallels between Moses & Jesus?\n-- What was the significance of each of the ten plagues against Egypt?\n\nWant to see pictures of everything that Frank is talking about? Don't miss the premiere of the video podcast on Friday (11/29) at 9:00 PM ET where the visuals make the archaeology come to life and stay tuned to our social media channels during the next two weeks to see LIVE video footage from Frank's upcoming trip!\n\nDid you enjoy this episode?

      "description": "Should reparations be paid to people who are the ancestors of slaves? After all, aren't reparations biblical? On this midweek podcast episode, Monique Duson and Krista Bontrager from The Center for Biblical Unity return to continue the conversation that centers on their new book, 'Walking in Unity: Biblical Answers to Questions on Race and Racism' and address the following questions:\n\n-- Can a biblical case be made for reparations?\n-- What's the major problem with the modern day reparations movement?\n-- Is the way we see Black America today a direct result of slavery?\n-- Are all disparities due to racism?\n-- Did Lyndon Johnson's 'War on Poverty' help or hurt the black community?\n\nDuring the second half of the episode, you'll also hear the fascinating story of how their ministry started, including details of the supernatural event that brought them together and how their friendship remained intact despite the seemingly insurmountable barriers they encountered along the way. It's an amazing testimony of how God still intervenes in our lives today and you definitely don't want to miss it!\n\nLink to previous podcast with Monique & Krista: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vtZnbgfOY\nThe Center for Biblical Unity: https://www.centerforbiblicalunity.com/\nWalking in Unity: Biblical Answers to Questions on Race and Racism: https://a.co/d/hEuCdwe\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "How much do you know about the major world religions? Whether it's atheism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, or one of the many Eastern religions, humanity holds a wide array of beliefs about who God is and if He even exists at all. But what if more Christians dedicated time to learning about other religions? How could this strengthen our faith along with our ability to share the Gospel?\n\nWe're kicking off December with renowned Christian apologist and philosopher, Dr. Doug Groothuis, professor at Cornerstone University in Grand Rapids, MI and the author of 20+ books, including his latest work, 'World Religions in Seven Sentences: A Small Introduction to a Vast Topic'. In this episode, Frank and Doug discuss the inspiration behind the book and unpack some of the core beliefs of today's major world religions\u2014one sentence at a time. Together, they\u2019ll tackle questions like:\n\n-- What are the seven sentences that represent each world religion, and why did Doug choose them?\n-- What makes Friedrich Nietzsche the \"quintessential atheist\"?\n-- Should atheism be classified as a religion? And what typically happens when atheism and Marxism collide?\n-- What are some of the key differences between Hinduism and Buddhism?\n-- What's the connection between Nietzsche, Pol Pot, Ted Bundy, and human depravity?\n-- Why do some people choose to be atheists?\n-- What happened when Doug encountered a Hinda guru at the age of 18?\nHow do Judaism and Islam differ in their relationship to Christianity?\n\nIf exploring diverse faith systems seems overwhelming, 'World Religions in Seven Sentences' is the perfect guide to get started. Tune in as Frank and Doug reveal how false religions often lead to human suffering and why Christianity alone is the solution to the problem of evil in the world.

      "description": "How do you convince non-Christians that homosexuality is wrong without using the Bible? Does human flourishing replace the need for God and the moral argument? And why does God create people that He knows will end up in Hell? In this week's solo podcast episode, Frank tackles three BIG questions that were recently sent in from our listening audience. During this discussion, Frank shares some practical advice on how to address these sensitive topics along with questions like:\n\n-- Should Christians be concerned about what people do privately?\n-- How does natural marriage contribute to spiritual maturity?\n-- Are morals biologically determined?\n-- Does the existence of Hell prove that God is unjust?\n-- What thought-provoking questions can you ask people who are in support of homosexuality?\n-- Why doesn't atheism solve the problem of evil?\n-- What does the Bible say about divine justice?\n-- How can pain and suffering possibly result in GOOD?\n\nBrace yourself \u2014 this episode is not politically correct, but it will be correct!

      "description": "The fine-tuning of the universe is one of the most compelling arguments for Intelligent Design\u2014so compelling that even atheists like Richard Dawkins and the late Christopher Hitchens have acknowledged its challenge to materialistic explanations. Why is the fine-tuning argument so extraordinary, and how have recent scientific discoveries made it even clearer that the universe points to a divine Creator?\n\nThis week, Dr. Jay Richards joins Frank to discuss the 20th anniversary edition of 'The Privileged Planet: How Our Place in the Cosmos Is Designed for Discovery', the groundbreaking book he co-authored with Dr. Guillermo Gonzalez. Together, they explore the updated book and the remarkable new scientific discoveries that continue to affirm its hypothesis. During their conversation, they\u2019ll address:\n\n-- How and why did Guillermo's career suffer when the book was first released in 2004?\n-- What updates have been made to the 20th anniversary edition?\n-- What is the likelihood that life exists on other planets?\n-- How is materialism a self-defeating worldview?\n-- What is the cosmological constant and what type of precision is required in order for a planet to be able to sustain life?\n-- How probable is a multiverse?\n-- What's so special about \"perfect\" solar eclipses?\n-- What are the most common atheist objections to fine-tuning and our privileged position in the Universe?\n\nIf you're looking for a good stocking stuffer this Christmas, grab the 20th Anniversary Edition of 'The Privileged Planet', a book and documentary film that continues to stand the test of time and compels readers to acknowledge how the complexity and fine-tuning of the universe couldn't possibly be the result of a cosmic accident!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\nThe Privileged Planet Website: https://privilegedplanet.com/\n\nThe Privileged Planet 20th Anniversary Book: https://www.discovery.org/b/privileged-planet/\n\nThe Privileged Planet Video on Demand: https://go2rpi.com/privileged-planet-vod/\n\nFollow Dr. Jay Richards on X: https://x.com/DrJayRichards\n\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "Does the scientific evidence fall short of proving the fine-tuning of the universe? Should Christians regularly \"feel God's presence\"? And since there are minor differences in the Gospels, does that disprove biblical inerrancy? In this midweek podcast episode, Frank tackles three more BIG questions from our listening audience along with question like:\n\n-- What are the 3 levels of fine-tuning and does it only occur here on planet Earth?\n-- Can the fine-tuning argument alone actually prove Christianity is true? And can all truth be explained through science?\n-- Where exactly are Heaven and Hell?\n-- What's the true meaning of Christmas?\n-- Is loving God an emotion, a feeling, or a decision?\n-- If God chooses not to reveal Himself to us is that proof that He doesn't exist?\n-- What's a great question to ask your skeptic friends?\n\nHave a question you\u2019d like Frank to address in a future episode?

      "description": "What would you expect to find at the REAL Mount Sinai? Could its true location be in Saudi Arabia rather than the traditional site in the Sinai Peninsula? Recent discoveries have reignited interest in Jabal al-Lawz as a possible candidate for the biblical Mount Sinai, and this week, you\u2019ll have the chance to examine the evidence for yourself!\n\nIn this podcast episode, Frank unpacks some of the details of his recent trip to Saudi Arabia, including what he and the group saw as they climbed the mountain at Jabal al-Lawz. He'll also discuss what fascinating markers distinguish this mountain as a great contender for Mount Sinai and why it's more important than ever for trained archaeologists to continue exploring the site. During the episode, Frank will answer questions like:\n\n-- Why was the Sinai Peninsula originally selected as Mount Sinai?\n-- How long did it take Frank and the group to get up the mountain?\n-- Why have there been so few excavations at Jabal al-Lawz?\n-- Who is Hathor and what's a possible explanation for all the cow drawings found on the mountain?\n-- What evidence exists suggesting that Jabal al-Lawz is the true Mount Sinai?\n-- What were Frank and the group AMAZED to see once they reached the top of Jabal al-Lawz?\n-- What's so special about the Split Rock of Horeb? And how many people were involved in the Exodus?\n\nWhile it's still too early to make a concrete conclusion on Jabal al-Lawz, the circumstantial evidence discussed in the podcast episode may cause you to seriously consider it to be the REAL Mount Sinai.

      "description": "Why is December 25th celebrated as the birth of Jesus? Was it a date chosen to overshadow pagan festivals like Saturnalia or Sol Invictus, or does it have deeper Christian roots? While the Bible doesn\u2019t provide a specific birthdate for Christ, it may offer more clues than you think!\n\nJust in time for the holiday season, historian and author Bill Federer returns to unpack the fascinating origins of the Christmas story and its rich Christian heritage. One of our most popular topics, this episode dives deeper into the history, theology, and traditions surrounding the incarnation of Christ\u2014a moment that forever changed the course of human history. Join Frank and Bill as they explore questions like:\n\n-- How do the Dead Sea Scrolls provide evidence for Jesus' actual birthday?\n-- Why do some Christians celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6th?\n-- When did Christians start celebrating Dec. 25th as the birthday of Jesus?\n-- What is one of the most overlooked pro-life passages in the Bible?\n-- What's the story of King Herod and was he really capable of being a baby killer?\n-- Why was there strife between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and how did Rome get involved in Jewish politics?\n-- How many wise men brought gifts to Jesus and when did they visit Him?\n-- Why are the Old Testament prophecies about Jesus so vague?\n-- What's the origin of the \"12 days of Christmas\"?\n-- How does the history of the entire world center on the birth of Christ?\n\nTune in as Bill dispels some of the common myths surrounding the Christmas holiday and uses his gift of storytelling to connect the historical and biblical pieces together. This episode will be both enlightening and entertaining as it also lays out the message of the Gospel, so be sure to share it with a friend! Merry Christmas from the CrossExamined team and please check out our earlier conversation with Bill where he shares even MORE history behind some of today's most beloved Christmas traditions with visuals included!\n\nDid you enjoy this episode?

      "description": "Charles Spurgeon once said that discernment is knowing the difference between right and \"almost right\". But when there's so much noise and confusion happening in the news and on social media these days, how can we tell the difference?\nAs we approach the end of 2024, our friend Dr. Jay Richards returns to unpack some of the essentials of economics, the Christian worldview, and social trends so that you can be informed when it comes to the issues that matter the most. Join Frank and Jay as they discuss the importance of understanding the basics of economics and how it can help Christians think clearly about government policies, healthcare, and how it can equip believers to protect the most vulnerable populations in our society. Tune in as Frank and Jay answer questions like:\n\n\u202a--Does the Bible advocate for a specific economic system?\u202c\n--How did the government become so bloated, and why did it get involved in housing and education?\n--What\u2019s the difference between socialism and free-market capitalism?\n--What's the best way to help those in poverty and how do people end up trapped in the welfare system?\n--What did economist and philosopher Adam Smith mean by \"the invisible hand\"?\n\nDuring the second half of the program, they'll shift gears to examine the economic and cultural factors that are specifically driving the transgender movement. From the profit motives behind gender-affirming care to the resurgence of ancient Gnostic ideas, this thought-provoking conversation will shed light on how transgenderism became politicized, what's causing the major spike in gender dysphoria, and how to end child transitioning for good!\n\nDon\u2019t miss this thought-provoking, year-end episode, and please consider making a tax-deductible donation to CrossExamined so that we can continue to help Christians defend the faith and do our part to make Christ known across the globe! 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\nBook - 'Money, Greed, and God' by Dr. Jay Richards: https://a.co/d/46pGwlS\nJay's work at The Heritage Foundation: https://www.heritage.org/staff/jay-w-richards-phd\nSociety for Evidence-Based Gender Medicine: https://segm.org/\nBiological Integrity: https://biologicalintegrity.org/\nPrevious podcast - 'Money, Greed, and God' with Dr. Jay Richards: https://bit.ly/3DvSZn7\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "In our final podcast episode of 2024, Dr. Jay Richards returns to discuss three essential topics that often cause confusion and dissent among both Christians and non-Christians in America today: the history and purpose of government, macroevolutionary theory vs. intelligent design, and the root cause of chronic disease. Together, Frank and Jay address questions like:\n\n-- What is the biblical purpose of government?\n-- Where do our rights come from?\n-- How should we define American exceptionalism?\n-- Was America founded on Christianity or something else?\n-- What did Thomas Jefferson mean by \u201cseparation of church and state\u201d and how has the term been misused and misunderstood?\n-- What is macroevolutionary theory and why does it fail to explain the origin of life and new life forms?\n-- How should Christians respond to the \u201cGod of the gaps\u201d objection?\n-- Is Darwinism consistent with what we can observe in biology?\n-- Why is America sicker than ever despite our ultra-advanced health care system and will RFK Jr. solve the problem?\n\nFrom politics to science to health, Frank and Jay will cover a lot of essential truths in this year-end episode of 'I Don\u2019t Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist' that will still be relevant in the decades to come! If you want to learn more about any of these topics, be sure to check out our list of recommended resources below.

      "description": "Are you following the truth or are you following incentives that may cause you to turn your back on Christianity and throw Jesus under the bus? On this midweek podcast episode, Frank continues the conversation on the powerful incentives that often prevent us from denying ourselves and picking up our cross for Christ as we go through our daily lives. He'll answer questions like:\n\n-- What does FOMO (the fear of missing out) reveal about our underlying motivations?\n-- Why does the question, \"If Christianity were true, would you be a Christian?\" often reveal a non-believer's true intentions and desires?\n-- What did Norman Geisler mean when he said, \"Fraternity will almost always overcome theology.\"?\n-- What are some examples from the Bible when people follow incentives instead of following Christ?\n\nNear the end of the program, Frank addresses two listener questions related to this topic--one from an Indian American who is struggling to commit to Christianity because his family wants him to embrace his Hindu roots, and the second from a Muslim seeking clarification on some differences between the Quran and the Bible. There's no doubt that following Christ is ever an easy decision to make, and even Christians are susceptible to falling off the rails for the sake of convenience and not ruffling any feathers. But we hope this episode will encourage you no matter where you are on your journey with Jesus!\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY using the link below. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE\n\nTruth or Incentives?

      "description": "Is the Bible just about encouragement, living \"your truth,\" seeking personal happiness, finding your identity, and manifesting your desires? This self-centered perspective has quietly crept into the minds of many well-meaning Christians who are influenced by cultural lies that have been disguised as spiritual truths. But what are some of these \"happy lies\" you might unknowingly believe as a Christian and how can you correct them?\n\nIn this week\u2019s podcast, Frank welcomes our good friend, author, and Christian YouTuber, Melissa Dougherty, to discuss her brand new book, 'Happy Lies: How a Movement You (Probably) Never Heard Of Shaped Our Self-Obsessed World'. Together, they'll dive into the beliefs of the New Thought movement and its profound (yet often unnoticed) impact on the modern Church. During their conversation, Frank and Melissa will tackle questions like:\n\n-- What is the purpose of life according to the New Thought movement?\n-- What's the difference between New Thought and New Age?\n-- Is there a connection between New Thought and the Word of Faith movement?\n-- Should Christians recite affirmations?\n-- What do adherents of New Thought mean by \"Christ Consciousness\"?\n-- What are some of the key verses that are used in the New Thought movement and how are they twisted to deceive Christians?\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of New Thought, this episode will uncover how its teachings deceptively infiltrate Christian culture, distort Scripture, and subtly influence your worldview. Could some of the most well-known pastors be peddling New Thought in the pulpits of America today? Tune in next week for the surprising answer in the midweek podcast and make sure you pre-order a copy of Melissa's book, 'Happy Lies'!\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY using the link below. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE\n\nMelissa's Book - 'Happy Lies': https://a.co/d/igzRfqQ\nMelissa's Website: https://www.melissadougherty.co/\nMelissa's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/MelissaDougherty/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "In last week\u2019s episode, Melissa Dougherty, author of the brand-new book, 'Happy Lies', joined Frank to discuss the foundational beliefs of the New Thought movement and how its theology has misled many well-meaning Christians. This week, Melissa is back to dig even deeper into the surprising and troubling connections between New Thought and the Word of Faith movement and to share names of specific teachers of this false doctrine. Tune in as they answer questions like:\n\n-- How did the \"seeker-friendly\" church model begin and why doesn't it work long-term?\n-- Does Joel Osteen believe that we're \"little gods\"?\n-- Is it ok to name false teachers?\n-- How can New Thought and Word of Faith potentially shipwreck your faith?\n-- Would Jesus and the Apostles agree with these teachings?\n\nYou definitely don't want to miss this eye-opening discussion about the origins of the so-called \"Health, Wealth, and Prosperity Gospel\".

      "description": "How should Christians deal with demons, spiritual warfare, and the unseen realm? Is it possible evil spirits are the cause of your anxiety and depression? While some charismatics may go to the extreme and focus too much on demons, conservative Christians often avoid the topic altogether. But if Jesus and the Bible warns about demonic oppression and spiritual warfare, what can we as Christians do to recognize and combat it if and when it occurs in our personal lives?\n\nIn this week's podcast episode, Frank sits down with Dr. Karl Payne, former chaplain for the Seattle Seahawks and Discipleship Pastor at Antioch Bible Church in Redmond, WA, to uncover the realities of spiritual warfare as detailed in his book, 'Spiritual Warfare: Christians, Demonization, and Deliverance'. During their conversation, they'll tackle questions like:\n\n-- How did a non-charismatic, ordained conservative Baptist minister ever begin working with demonized individuals and what was the life-changing encounter that led Dr. Payne to learn more about the process of deliverance?\n-- What are the four primary causes of depression or mental anguish?\n-- Can Christians be demon-possessed?\n-- What three requirements are necessary for complete deliverance and healing?\n-- How did Jesus and the Apostle Paul deal with spiritual warfare according to the Bible?\n-- Does Hollywood do a good job of accurately depicting exorcisms?\n\nTogether, Frank and Karl will explore how spiritual battles and the role of demons impact both Christians and non-Christians, breaking down misconceptions about demon possession and how to help those who are being (perhaps unknowingly) tormented by evil. And don\u2019t miss next week\u2019s episode, where Frank and Karl will continue this eye-opening conversation about how to recognize and respond to spiritual attacks!\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY using the link below. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nKARL'S WEBSITE: https://karlpayne.org/\nKARL'S BOOK: Spiritual Warfare - https://a.co/d/3936g0I\nARTICLE: What Does the Bible Say About Demons? https://bit.ly/3PF8hsA\nSERMON: Spiritual Warfare by Timothy Keller - https://bit.ly/4hhsAYM\nGOOGLE BOOK: Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices - https://bit.ly/3CqcqgK\nPDF: Offensive Prayer: A Biblical Response to Demonic Attack - https://bit.ly/3PGVSo2\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#podcast",

      "description": "Can Christians experience demonic oppression? If so, how can they overcome these spiritual attacks and walk in freedom? In our last episode, Frank sat down with Dr. Karl Payne, author of 'Spiritual Warfare: Christians, Demonization, and Deliverance', to discuss his journey into deliverance ministry and the importance of preparing Christians to stand against spiritual warfare. This week, Dr. Payne returns to share more compelling real-life stories and insights from his ministry, demonstrating how Scripture provides the tools believers need to confront and defeat these attacks. During their conversation, Frank and Karl tackle questions such as:\n\n-- How do Christians inadvertently open themselves up to the demonic world?\n-- Can Christians be victims of generational curses?\n-- What are Satan's schemes, and how can Christians stand in opposition against them?\n-- What are the signs that you may be under spiritual attack?\n-- Where do many deliverance ministries go wrong?\n-- Could a spiritual attack be a good thing?\n-- How does the secular world deal with demonic oppression?\n\nWhether you're facing spiritual challenges, curious about deliverance ministry, or simply seeking to grow in your understanding of spiritual warfare, this discussion is packed with valuable keys to overcoming attacks when you encounter them yourself!

      "description": "Has the recent political shift softened the growing animosity toward Christians, or is hostility here to stay? The election may be over, but Christians can't afford to let our guards down just yet. While America might be moving toward cultural sanity, the battle for truth, justice, morality, and reason is far from over!\n\nThis week, our good friend, Unshaken Conference speaker, and author, Natasha Crain, joins Frank to discuss her timely new book, 'When Culture Hates You: Persevering for the Common Good as Christians in a Hostile Public Square'. Together, they\u2019ll explore how Christians can respond to persecution, speak truth boldly, and navigate cultural backlash and opposition with grace, courage, and humility, tackling questions like:\n\n-- Why do Christians need to speak truth in culture and link it to the Bible?\n-- What's the 'new vibe shift' that's taken place since the inauguration?\n-- Was the leftist female bishop justified in her public scrutiny of President Trump?\n-- What are the four main tenets of secularism?\n-- Are all Christians guilty of being Christian Nationalists?\n-- What's the difference between social justice and biblical justice?\n-- How can Christians help true victims fight for biblical justice?\n-- How do you respond if someone calls you a hateful bigot?\n\nDo you feel hated as a Christian? Get used to it, but don't give up! In this podcast episode, Frank and Natasha will offer encouragement for believers who experience persecution on any level, as well as provide practical tips on how to be salt and light in the midst of so much chaos. Be sure to order a copy of Natasha's book, 'When Culture Hates You', and don't miss the upcoming midweek podcast episode where Frank and Natasha will continue their conversation by discussing a topic that's TOO EXTREME for radio!\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY USING THE LINK BELOW. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE \ud83d\udcda\n\nNATASHA'S WEBSITE: https://natashacrain.com/\nORDER NATASHA'S BOOK: https://bit.ly/4h4BRUg\nWhat the Inauguration (and Vibe Shift) Means for Christians - https://bit.ly/4atoR8n\nFaithfully Different by Natasha Crain - https://a.co/d/eLTCktm\nUNSHAKEN CONFERENCE: https://unshakenconference.com/2025-events\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#podcast",

This week, Natasha returns to unpack the sobering final chapter that investigates the evils of the \"sexual liberation of children\" and the subtle ways that kids (and the people who raise them) are being targeted.\n\nWatch the full video podcast on Rumble HERE! \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udcfa https://rumble.com/v6egot7-jan27-podcast-ok.html\n\nOrder Natasha's new book HERE! \ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udcda https://bit.ly/4h4BRUg\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#podcast",

      "description": "Tragic events like the devastating collision between American Airlines Eagle Flight 5342 and a military Black Hawk helicopter that claimed the lives of 67 innocent people shake us to our core and leave us asking deep, unsettling questions. Questions like, where was God and why would He allow this to happen?\n\nSuffering is an unavoidable part of life, making it crucial for Christians to reconcile God's goodness with the presence of evil. This week, Frank sits down with Dr. Andy Steiger, co-creator of the new video series, 'Can I Trust the Bible?', and President of Apologetics Canada, to tackle one of the most difficult topics in apologetics: the problem of evil. During their conversation, they will answer questions like:\n\n-- Does the presence of evil disprove God?\n-- What does it mean to be human?\n-- What does it mean to love God first?\n-- What would happen to humanity in a fallen world without pain and suffering?\n-- What's a flat-tire Christian?\n-- Why is it important to have a high view of God?\n\nWith the reality that life is fleeting, Christians must be prepared to face hardships and learn what it means to suffer well. Tune in as Andy shares some of the tragedies he's encountered throughout his 25 years of pastoral ministry and explores how modern culture's \"you do you\" mentality contributes to an immoral and corrupt society.

      "description": "Does TikTok have more influence over your child than you do as a Christian parent? God has placed the responsibility on parents to disciple their children, yet studies show that many professing Christians don\u2019t even have a biblical worldview themselves. So, what do Christians actually believe, and how can parents be intentional about leading their kids in truth before the culture does?\n\nIn this episode, former California public school teacher and Biola-certified Christian apologist, Shanda Fulbright, joins Frank to unpack how schools and social media are subtly indoctrinating kids with secular ideas and how parents can steer their kids in the right direction before it's too late! Tune in as they tackle questions like:\n\n-- What are the eight key questions that form a robust biblical worldview?\n-- What did Shanda experience as a public school teacher in California?\n-- What is the main goal of the public education system when it comes to teaching kids?\n-- Why aren't logic and critical thinking skills taught in public schools anymore?\n-- How does DEI find its way into any school (public or private) even though it might not be required teaching?\n-- How do you teach a biblical worldview, and what are the \u201c3 I\u2019s\u201d to help instill it in kids?\n-- What do you do when your kids ask questions about Christianity and other religions that you don't know how to answer?\n\nYour children are growing up fast, and time is of the essence to train them up in the Lord! If this all feels overwhelming\u2014we can help! Shanda and Frank have created a fun and engaging online course just for teens and pre-teens to address these critical issues. 'Expedition to Reality' is an 8-week online course beginning on FEB. 24 that is designed to help 7th-9th graders build confidence in their faith. The course includes 8 LIVE Zoom sessions with Shanda and 1 special Q&A session with Shanda and Frank. The class is already half-full, so secure your child's spot TODAY! There is also a SELF-PACED version of the course available for kids or adults too!\n\nEnroll your child in the PREMIUM COURSE here -- https://bit.ly/4ahfKHP\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY USING THE LINK BELOW. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nSHANDA'S NEW OCC COURSE - Expedition to Reality: https://bit.ly/4ahfKHP\nSHANDA'S WEBSITE: https://www.shandafulbright.com/\nOCC COURSE - Train Your Brain: https://bit.ly/46eXMU3\nOCC COURSE - Let's Get Real: https://bit.ly/40N7LxQ\nBOOK: 'Faithfully Different' by Natasha Crain - https://a.co/d/5HDHsDE\nBRAVE BOOKS: Elephants Are Not Birds - https://bit.ly/4hjBZ2p\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "Are you willing to follow the evidence wherever it leads? What if it goes against everything you previously believed to be true? In this solo episode of 'I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist', Frank unpacks a thought-provoking email from an atheist in France, who's innate fear of death now has her questioning everything she was taught about the world. Tune is as he addresses her many questions and concerns, and shares her journey from staunch materialism to becoming open to Christianity. During the episode he'll tackle questions like:\n\n-- Is it possible that Jesus had a twin brother that nobody knew about?\n-- Is believing in miracles totally irrational?\n-- Would frequent miracles help the case for Christianity? \n-- Which one should we trust more--the evidence or our feelings?\n-- Is being a Christian like believing in Santa Claus?\n-- Do we always have to see something to believe it?\n-- Should Christians always carry the burden of truth?\n\nWhether you identify as an atheist, agnostic, or are struggling through your own season of doubt, this episode is packed with some of the strongest arguments for the truth of Christianity and will challenge you to critically examine your worldview, explore the evidence for the resurrection of Jesus, and consider what\u2019s at stake if Christianity is true.

      "description": "What could possibly be wrong with \"following our heart\"? Isn't that what culture always tells us to do? In this week\u2019s solo podcast episode, Frank responds to a troubling email from \"Jane\", a self-identified lesbian teenager struggling with conflict at home since coming out to her mother. Tune in as Frank walks through a series of thought-provoking questions designed to help Jane reflect on the long-term consequences of her choices. During the episode, Frank tackles key questions, including:\n\n-- Why is theology the foundation of all knowledge?\n-- Why shouldn\u2019t people define themselves by their sexual desires?\n-- What should (and shouldn't) parents do if your child comes out to you as same-sex attracted?\n-- Should your attractions determine your actions?\n-- What are three reasons why homosexuality falls short of natural marriage?\n-- Do sexual desires ever change over time?\n-- If no one is harmed, why shouldn\u2019t people simply follow their hearts?\n-- How do sexual patterns among homosexuals differ from those in committed heterosexual relationships?\n\nDiscussing sexuality from a Christian perspective is intellectually simple but emotionally difficult, which is why taking a gentle approach can make all the difference! This episode will encourage listeners to guard their hearts, consider the real-world consequences of living without moral boundaries, and most importantly, remember why following Jesus is always the right choice\u2014no matter what culture says.\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE:\n\n\ufeff\ufeffBOOK: Correct, Not Politically Correct - \ufeffhttps://bit.ly/3qws2ZL\ufeff\nBOOK: Born Again This Way by Rachel Gilson - \ufeffhttps://a.co/d/9XMdcSu\ufeff\nBOOK: Five Lies of Our Anti-Christian Age by Rosaria Butterfield - \ufeffhttps://a.co/d/7IsnzdP\ufeff\nYOUTUBE: Should You Follow Your Heart?

      "description": "Ladies and gentlemen, we are witnessing something unprecedented in American history! This week, we\u2019ll explore how President Donald Trump is using the \"shock and awe\" strategy to shake up the political landscape - and more importantly, how Christians should navigate this new era without becoming complacent or too comfortable with the changing leadership.\n\nWith the recent transfer of political power, how has the current administration managed to accomplish so much in such a short time? And are these rapid changes more beneficial or more detrimental to the American people? Jorge Gil and John Ferrer temporarily take over the 'I Don\u2019t Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist' podcast to examine Trump\u2019s bold political moves from a nuanced, biblical perspective, tackling key questions such as:\n\n-- What is the \"shock and awe\" strategy, and how is Trump using it to reshape the political landscape?\n-- How has the political left and legacy media lost the trust of the American people, and why have they failed to regain it?\n-- What were Trump\u2019s three biggest campaign promises, and has he followed through on them?\n-- Is Trump acting like a dictator, or have the attacks against him only strengthened his influence?\n-- What has Elon Musk and DOGE uncovered about government waste and corruption?\n-- Why shouldn't Christians put too much trust in the Trump Administration or any political party?\n\nIt\u2019s a fascinating\u2014and at times overwhelming\u2014political climate, but in this conversation, Jorge and John will encourage Christians to stay engaged, keep up with current events, and analyze it all through a biblical lense. Tune in to learn how Christians can stand as beacons of light, restore civil discourse, and foster courage and hope in America.

      "description": "Is free speech in danger? Imagine facing jail time simply for posting something online that the government disagrees with. This alarming reality is unfolding in parts of Europe where so-called \"hate speech\" is now being criminalized. Could the same thing happen in America?\n\nThis week, our friend and Arizona State University professor, Dr. Owen Anderson, returns to share an update on his ongoing litigation with the university and to unpack how censorship on U.S. soil threatens the First Amendment and our ability to preach and live the gospel. Tune in as Frank and Owen dive into how the radical left uses emotional blackmail and fear tactics to silence opposition\u2014and how you can recognize and push back against cancel culture. During their conversation, they'll tackle questions like:\n\n-- What's the state of free speech in Germany?\n-- Is hate speech protected by the First Amendment?\n-- What was the purpose of the First Amendment and why should we fight to protect it?\n-- Are we putting people in physical harm if we disagree with them?\n-- Can you stop fascism with fascism?\n-- Did Jesus ever insult anyone\u2014and is it ever wise for Christians to do the same?\n\nLater in the episode, Frank and Owen will comment on Vice President J.D. Vance's recent rebuke of European leaders, highlighting the fragile state of democracy and free speech abroad. They\u2019ll also address ASU\u2019s protests against Mary Rice Hasson for her stand against gender ideology and explore how the radical left weaponizes terms like \"emotional abuse\" to cancel critics.

      "description": "Sorry Aunt Mildred and Uncle Bob--nobody wants to use your names for their children anymore! But what does that have to do with the credibility of the New Testament writers? In this fun and fascinating episode of 'I Don\u2019t Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist', Frank explores why the names we see recorded in ancient history matter and unpacks how these names serve as powerful evidence that the New Testament writers were actual eyewitnesses to the events they described in the Gospels and the Book of Acts.\n\nJoin Frank as he tackles key questions like:\n\n-- How have name trends changed in the U.S. over the last 100 years, and how does this relate to the reliability of the Scriptures?\n-- What is an undesigned coincidence, and what examples of undesigned coincidences do we find in the New Testament?\n-- How do scholars know when Paul wrote his letters?\n-- Who are the 34 people mentioned in the New Testament that have also been verified by secular sources?\n-- What archeological evidence and non-Christian writings corroborate with what we see written in the Gospels?\n-- What's the Spider-Man Fallacy? And should the New Testament be categorized as historical fiction?\n\nYou'll also hear some exciting news about the newest addition to Frank's family (HINT: it's a GIRL--FINALLY!) along with the next BIG CrossExamined international trip that is currently in the works!

      "description": "Is it possible that Jesus, the most influential person in history, was just a fictional character? In this midweek podcast, Frank responds to a question from Elijah, a medical student in Ghana, whose evolutionist professor seems unwilling to consider that Jesus existed unless Elijah can provide first century sources from outside of the Bible. What's the most effective way for Elijah to engage with his teacher's skepticism? Join Frank as he explores these questions and more, including:\n\n-- How can you respectfully defend your faith in the classroom?\n-- What historical and archaeological evidence confirms Jesus\u2019 existence?\n-- Are extra-biblical sources more credible than the New Testament writers?\n-- What common presuppositions do atheists hold, and how can you respectfully challenge them?\n-- Are there any atheist or agnostic New Testament scholars who believe that Jesus never existed?\n-- Was Christianity a Roman invention designed to control the masses?\n-- What unique characteristics does Jesus hold that we don't find in any other human being?\n\nTune in as Frank not only shares the facts, but also gives practical advice on engaging skeptics with confidence, clarity, and respect.

Tune in as Bill unpacks its historical backdrop, revealing why Europe took up arms to blunt the rise and expansion of Islam. During their conversation, Frank and Bill will answer questions like:\n\n-- Did the Crusaders know the Bible?\n-- What did the Pope promise the Crusaders? \n-- How did Islam originate, and how did it expand so rapidly?\n-- Did Christianity spread as a direct result of the Crusades?\n-- What would have happened to Europe if the Crusades had never taken place?\n-- Were the Crusades an example of Just War?\n-- What was Muhammad's involvement in the slave trade, and what sparked the onset of the Dark Ages?\n-- What happened on the crusades that cannot be justified? \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever struggled to answer objections about Christianity and the Crusades, you won\u2019t want to miss this episode of 'I Don\u2019t Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist'! Bill\u2019s engaging storytelling will bring these historical events to life and offer valuable insights into the series of events that led to each major Crusade. Since there\u2019s only so much we can cover in one episode, be sure to check out Bill\u2019s book, 'What Every American Needs to Know About the Quran', for a deeper dive into the history of Islam and its impact on Western civilization!\n\nIs there a guest or topic you'd love to hear discussed on a future podcast?

Join Dr. Frank Turek on MON. 3/10 at 7:30 PM ET for Session #4 of his BRAND NEW Bible Study TV Series - 'The Bible You Never Knew: Stories Stitched by the Hand of God.\u2019 This week we will focus on the stories of Joseph and Moses.\nWe\u2019ll see that not only are the Scriptures telling the historical truth, but they are much more inspiring than just a historical record. There are repeated themes and events from Genesis to Revelation that give us a more profound sense of who God is and His mission for us. They also demonstrate that only God can be the primary inspirational force behind the Bible. There\u00a0will also be time for Q&A from the online chat as well. Set a reminder on your phone, bring your Bible,\u00a0tell your friends, and be sure to join us LIVE because the video will only be up on our YouTube channel for a limited time!",

      "description": "Why doesn\u2019t God make Himself more obvious? If God truly exists, why wouldn\u2019t He just appear to everyone and settle all doubts once and for all? In a world filled with skepticism, doubt, and unbelief, the \"divine hiddenness\" of God is one of the most common objections raised against Christianity. But is it really a valid reason to reject His existence? In this solo midweek episode, Frank tackles a listener\u2019s question about God\u2019s hiddenness and explores these questions along the way:\n\n-- Does the hiddenness of God negate the evidence we already have for His existence?\n-- What does Scripture reveal about why God may choose to remain unseen?\n-- Would seeing the full presence of God actually eliminate doubt and unbelief for some people?\n-- How do free will and love relate to divine hiddenness?  \n-- Why didn't Jesus parade Himself around publicly post-resurrection so that everyone could see Him?\n-- How did so many Pharisee priests come to believe in Jesus?\n-- Were the angels ever exposed to the full presence of God?\n\nIf you\u2014or someone you know\u2014wrestles with the hiddenness of God, this episode will help you see how His presence can still be known. Don\u2019t miss this thought-provoking discussion on one of the most challenging questions from skeptics!\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE:\n\nDon't forget to take our podcast survey! https://crossexamined.org/survey\nThe Screwtape Letters by C.S.

      "description": "How much evidence exists for the martyrdom of the apostles? Did they REALLY die for their faith? Christians often use this argument to defend the credibility of Jesus' death and resurrection, but could we be overstating the case?\n\nThis week, let's dive into the latest research on Christian martyrdom with one of today\u2019s leading experts on the topic--our good friend Dr. Sean McDowell! A decade ago, his groundbreaking research challenged what we thought we knew about the fate of the apostles. Now, with new discoveries and fresh insights, the second edition of 'The Fate of the Apostles' has been released\u2014offering the most up-to-date investigation into their martyrdom. Join Frank and Sean as they uncover what really happened to the closest followers of Jesus and tackle pressing questions like:\n\n-- What incident spurred Sean to make 'The Fate of the Apostles' the topic of his doctoral dissertation?\n-- What updates has Sean made to the second edition of his book?\n-- Was Peter crucified upside-down and how did this tradition get started?\n-- Which apostles does Sean believe have the highest (and lowest) probabilities of being martyred?\n-- Is there evidence that any of the apostles recanted their testimony?\n-- Is John the only apostle who died from natural causes?\n-- If we say martyrdom proves Christianity is true, what about the martyrs of other religions?\n-- Is there good reason to believe that Joseph Smith died as a martyr for Mormonism?\n\nForget 'Foxe\u2019s Book of Martyrs'\u2014'The Fate of the Apostles' is today's go-to comprehensive resource for studying the martyrdom accounts of the apostles! Tune in as Sean clears up some common misconceptions and shares insights from leading New Testament scholars who both agree and disagree with his findings on this fascinating episode of 'I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist!'\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE\n\nSean\u2019s website: https://seanmcdowell.org/\nThe Fate of the Apostles (2nd Edition): https://www.amazon.com/dp/1032580542\n\nIs there a guest or topic you'd love to hear discussed on a future podcast?

      "description": "Are we witnessing a renewed interest in God, Christianity, and Jesus in today\u2019s culture? For this midweek podcast, Frank welcomes back our favorite father-son duo, Cliffe and Stuart Knechtle from the popular Youtube channel, 'Give Me an Answer', to share their unique insights into the recent rise of Christianity in the West, particularly on college campuses. They\u2019ll also discuss how the rapid growth of their ministry has led to incredible opportunities to share the Gospel on major secular and Christian platforms. \n\nTune in as Frank, Stuart, and Cliffe answer key questions like:\n\n-- What major cultural shifts has Cliffe observed over the past 40 years, and why has he softened his approach?\n-- Why are young people today so anxious, and what is their biggest fear?\n-- What are some of the most common misconceptions and objections to Christianity that Cliffe and Stuart encounter, and how do they respond?\n-- Why should we care about sin?\n-- How should Christians address the topic of homosexuality and other cultural issues with grace and truth?\n-- How did the Knechtles end up on popular shows with Logan Paul, Alex O'Connor, and George Janko?\n-- How important is it to have an eternal perspective on life, and why is God\u2019s judgment actually good news?\n\nCliffe and Stuart\u2019s commitment to open-air preaching has led to incredible ministry growth\u2014but not without its challenges! Find out what\u2019s happening on the frontlines, where they\u2019ll be traveling next, how you can be praying for them, and simple ways you can support their mission!\n\nIs there a guest or topic you'd love to hear discussed on a future podcast?

How can you educate and entertain them while ensuring they aren\u2019t indoctrinated by secularism? Christian parents and grandparents have been crying out for someone in the entertainment world to champion biblical values that lead to their children\u2019s health, protection, and blessing\u2014now, there\u2019s finally an answer!\n\nThis week, Frank sits down with actor and conservative activist, Kirk Cameron, to talk about his partnership with Brave Books and his new children\u2019s program, 'Iggy & Mr. Kirk', designed to train kids in the Lord. How is Kirk using his unique gifts and talents to invest in the hearts and minds of young children? Tune in as Frank and Kirk unpack Kirk's latest ministry projects and tackle questions like:\n\n-- How did Kirk become a Hollywood actor at the age of 10 and then make the transition from atheism to Christianity?\n-- Why did Kirk need bodyguards and bulletproof vests when reading wholesome books at public libraries?\n-- What excuse do many Christians use to avoid engaging in culture battles instead of creating solutions to make things better?\n-- What does Kirk mean when he says there's two groups of people in the world--reporters and reformers?\n-- What makes 'Iggy & Mr. Kirk' different from every other television program made for kids?\n-- What Brave Book titles do Frank's grandchildren ask him to read to them over and over again?\n\nBrave Books offers entertainment the whole family can enjoy while sparking meaningful faith conversations with kids who need biblical discipleship. If you want to be one of the first to get a sneak peek of 'Iggy & Mr. Kirk' and find out how your family can watch this brand-new series, along with more than 50 parent-approved shows that teach Christian values, don\u2019t miss this fun and family-friendly episode of 'I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist!'\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE:\n\nKirk's website: \ufeffhttps://www.kirkcameron.com/\ufeff\nKirk's book 'Born to Be Brave': \ufeffhttps://a.co/d/1FePYjg\ufeff\nLearn more about 'Iggy and Mr. Kirk': \ufeffhttps://bravebooks.us/pages/the-adventures-with-iggy-and-mr-kirk\nBrave Books: \ufeffhttps://bravebooks.us/\ufeff\nBrave+ Streaming Entertainment for Kids: \ufeffhttps://braveplus.com/\ufeff\nTakeaways Podcast: \ufeffhttps://bit.ly/4c5MEw1\ufeff\nAmerican Campfire Revival: \ufeffhttps://www.kirkcameron.com/acr\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY using the link below. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

Join Dr. Frank Turek on MON. 3/24 at 7:30 PM ET for Session #5 of his BRAND NEW Bible Study TV Series - 'The Bible You Never Knew: Stories Stitched by the Hand of God.\u2019 This week we will study the stories of Moses and the Exodus.\n\nWe\u2019ll see that not only are the Scriptures telling the historical truth, but they are much more inspiring than just a historical record. There are repeated themes and events from Genesis to Revelation that give us a more profound sense of who God is and His mission for us. They also demonstrate that only God can be the primary inspirational force behind the Bible. There will also be time for Q&A from the online chat as well. Set a reminder on your phone, bring your Bible, tell your friends, and be sure to join us LIVE because the recording will only be up on our YouTube channel for a limited time!",

      "description": "Why is propaganda and empty rhetoric so appealing to some people? In this midweek episode, Frank explains how the first of 'The Screwtape Letters' by C.S. Lewis perfectly illustrates the way demons manipulate human beings, now and throughout history. He'll also explore the recent power struggles between the Trump Administration and the lower district court judge who blocked Trump's transgender military ban. Frank will answer questions like:\n\n-- Why is using \"jargon\" instead of evidence-based arguments not good thinking?\n-- What specific tactics does C.S. Lewis say demons use to tempt humans and where do we see evidence of this happening in our culture today?\n-- Do all people have the right or privilege to serve in the military?\n-- Was Trump's decision to say transgender people are not qualified to serve in the military unconstitutional?\n-- Why is it so difficult to impeach judges, and do we really have only three branches of government?\n-- What do a lot of people get wrong about Islam?\n\nFrank also tackles some listener questions about who will be resurrected (is it only Christians?) and whether an old-earth contradicts biblical genealogies. Plus, he\u2019ll reveal details about his numerous speaking events coming up this spring\u2014so listen closely to see if he's coming to a city near you!\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE:\n\nLIVE from Mississippi State University - https://www.youtube.com/live/vs1TPxgTer4?t=6885s\nThe ScrewTape Letters by C.S.

      "description": "Why are so many people fascinated with evil stories of murder, and true crime? And more importantly, can we use that fascination to point them to Jesus? Christianity is the only worldview that answers the problem of evil adequately, and now there\u2019s a new graphic novel that tackles this big question in a way that\u2019s both artistic and compelling!\n\nThis week, Frank sits down with cold-case detective and bestselling author, J. Warner Wallace, along with his son and co-author, Jimmy Wallace, to discuss their new book, 'Case Files: Murder and Meaning\u2019. As a father-son duo with deep roots in law enforcement, they\u2019re using their real-life experiences to craft a crime story that sneaks apologetics into an action-packed graphic novel. Tune in as they address questions like:\n\n-- Why do so many police officers become cynical, and what does that reveal about human nature?\n-- How did their experience in law enforcement help Jim and Jimmy to write this story?\n-- What makes 'Case Files' different from other apologetics books?\n-- How can storytelling help people wrestle with questions about morality and justice?\n-- What are some of the biggest misconceptions that the public has about police and detective work?\n-- How did the George Floyd and BLM riots radically shift the police world?\n-- What are some of the common internal and psychological struggles of police officers?\n-- How did Jim overcome his season of identity crisis once he retired?\n\nBe sure to pre-order your copy of 'Case Files: Murder and Meaning' and then head to Jim's website to grab some exclusive bonus resources! If you know anyone who loves crime stories, comics, or big questions about life, this book might just be the tool that sparks some amazing faith conversations!\n\n\ud83d\udcda \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde0\ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\n\nJim's website: https://coldcasechristianity.com/\nJ.

      "description": "Are there contradictions between the gospel accounts? If so, how can we trust the central tenet of Christianity--the Resurrection of Jesus? Last week, J. Warner Wallace and his son Jimmy Wallace joined Frank to discuss their exciting new graphic novel, 'Case Files: Meaning and Murder'. For this midweek podcast, J. Warner Wallace returns to share how he used his skill set as a detective to investigate the claims of the New Testament gospels and compares his findings to those of atheist/agnostic New Testament scholar, Bart Ehrman.\n\nTogether, Frank and Jim answer questions like:\n\n-- What's necessary to prove an event occured in the past?\n-- Why weren't first-century historians bothered by textual differences found in the Gospels?\n-- Why is it better to have four different gospel accounts vs. one harmonization?\n-- Why would God allow these textual differences?\n-- What surprised Jim the most the first time he read the Gospels as an atheist?\n-- Why do detectives separate eyewitnesses?\n-- When doing detective work, why does Jim prefer it when the stories are \"messy\"?\n-- Does the evidence always determine the verdict? In other words, why do Jim and Bart come to different conclusions when it comes to the Resurrection of Jesus?\n-- Why is bias against the supernatural a double-standard for materialist atheists?\n-- What's the best way to test an eyewitness?\n-- If the Gospels are contradictory and can\u2019t be trusted, why do critics like Erhman conclude that much of the New Testament is true and that the disciples really believed they saw the resurrected Jesus?   \n-- How are atheists disagreeing with themselves and agreeing with Christians when it comes to alternative explanations for the resurrection?\n\nAnd so much more! If you normally listen to podcasts on 2x speed you may need to slow it down for this one and take some notes!\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE\n\nJim's website - https://coldcasechristianity.com/\nCold Case Christianity - https://a.co/d/dABS4uA\nCase Files: Murder & Meaning - https://casefilesgraphicnovel.com/\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY USING THE LINK BELOW. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "How do you spend 20 years talking to some of the world\u2019s most well-known atheists and still remain a committed Christian? Is it possible that belief in God actually makes sense?\n\nPopular radio host and podcaster Justin Brierley has been creating and facilitating constructive conversations about faith for more than two decades, and has had a ringside seat as believers and nonbelievers have debated Christianity. This week on the podcast, Justin joins Frank to discuss his upcoming book, 'Why I'm Still a Christian: After Two Decades of Conversations with Skeptics and Atheists\u2013The Reason I Believe' and shares how he kept his faith intact while engaging with skeptics from around the world. Together, he and Frank answer big questions like:\n\n-- What led Justin to write this book, and what ultimately convinces him that Christianity is true?\n-- Is Christianity intellectually defensible in a secular age?\n-- What are the strongest arguments for (and against) the existence of God?\n-- Why are some leading atheists reconsidering their skepticism?\n-- Has science truly made belief in God obsolete?\n-- How can Christians engage skeptics without losing their own faith?\n-- What advice does Justin have for people who may be \"deconstructing\" their faith?\n\nBe among the first to read Justin's new book and preorder 'Why I'm Still a Christian' before its official release on 4/22! This book is the culmination of Justin\u2019s years of dialogue with atheists, investigating the most compelling evidence that keeps him firmly rooted in Christ.

      "description": "Why do Christians think Jesus is the only way to Heaven? And what ultimately sets Christianity apart from other religions like Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism? In this midweek episode, Frank explains why Jesus is the only way to salvation and why good works or sincere belief in other religions won't save you. Tune is as he also tackles questions like:\n\n-- Does simply saying you believe Jesus is our LORD and Saviour enough to save you?\n-- Why was Jesus' sacrifice necessary?\n-- Are all non-Christians going to Hell, even if they\u2019re \"good\" people?\n-- Why can\u2019t a loving God allow everyone into Heaven, regardless of their beliefs?\n-- Do you need Christianity to be a good person?\n-- What\u2019s wrong with the popular 'He Gets Us' campaign?\n-- How are people tormented in Hell?\n-- What's the difference between justice and grace?\n-- Why is the nature of truth inherently exclusive?\n\nLater in the episode, Frank responds to a question from someone who attends a church that\u2019s splitting over the issue of homosexuality. How should Christians engage with others in the congregation who don\u2019t believe same-sex relationships are wrong? And more importantly, what kind of \"church\" doesn't follow the teachings of Jesus? He'll also dive into the topic of baptism\u2014what Scripture says about its purpose, and whether it\u2019s required for salvation. All this and more will be discussed in this special Q&A edition of 'I Don\u2019t Have Enough Faith to Be An Atheist'!\n\n\ud83d\udcda RESOURCES MENTIONED DURING THE EPISODE:\n\nBOOK: Stealing From God - https://bit.ly/41hLt91\nBOOK: Street Smarts - https://www.amazon.com/dp/0310139139\nBOOK: Tactics - https://bit.ly/3DgZ1bm\nPODCAST: What Could Be Wrong About Love? - https://youtu.be/MettT5ToozM\nTake a trip to Jordan, Israel, & Egypt with Frank! - https://bit.ly/4iUCUHi\n\nIf you enjoyed this podcast episode PLEASE HELP US SPREAD THE TRUTH OF CHRISTIANITY BY SUPPORTING OUR MINISTRY USING THE LINK BELOW. 100% of your donation goes to ministry, 0% to buildings!\n\n\ud83e\udd1d \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde7 \ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddeb\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde0\ud835\udddc\ud835\udde1\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7 (\ud835\udde7\ud835\uddd4\ud835\uddeb-\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udddf\ud835\uddd8) \ud83e\udd1d\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org/donate/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udddf \ud835\udde0\ud835\uddd8\ud835\uddd7\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd4 \ud83d\udc65\n\u25cf Facebook: https://facebook.com/CrossExamined.org\n\u25cf X https://twitter.com/Frank_Turek\n\u25cf Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drfrankturek/\n\u25cf TikTok: https://bit.ly/3SSqGE5\n\n\ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f \ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd8\ud835\udde6 \ud83d\uddc4\ufe0f\n\u25cf Website: https://crossexamined.org\n\u25cf Store: https://impactapologetics.com/\n\u25cf Online Courses: https://www.onlinechristiancourses.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf99\ufe0f \ud835\udde6\ud835\udde8\ud835\uddd5\ud835\udde6\ud835\uddd6\ud835\udde5\ud835\udddc\ud835\uddd5\ud835\uddd8 \ud835\udde7\ud835\udde2 \ud835\udde2\ud835\udde8\ud835\udde5 \ud835\udde3\ud835\udde2\ud835\uddd7\ud835\uddd6\ud835\uddd4\ud835\udde6\ud835\udde7 \ud83c\udf99\ufe0f\n\u25cf Apple Podcast: http://bit.ly/CrossExamined_Podcast\n\u25cf Spotify: http://bit.ly/CrossExaminedOfficial_Podcast\n\u25cf Pandora: https://bit.ly/3M3c3tY\n\u25cf iHeart: https://bit.ly/3ApZ2Il\n\u25cf Podchaser: https://bit.ly/46PBzfH\n\n#Podcast",

      "description": "How does someone go from co-founding one of the world\u2019s most visited websites as an atheist to becoming a Bible-believing Christian? And what kind of evidence can shake a skeptical philosopher out of his naturalistic worldview? This week, Frank sits down with Dr. Larry Sanger, co-founder of Wikipedia, to explore the surprising path that led him back to faith in Christ. Tune in as Larry shares how his early exposure to Christianity faded during his academic journey, how his curiosity was reignited by some disturbing cultural trends, and why he began to see the Bible in a new light. During their conversation, Frank and Larry will answer questions like:\n\n-- When and why did Larry stop believing in Christianity?\n-- How did Wikipedia get started and what does it teach us about human nature?\n-- What was it about the Bible that inspired Larry to read through it with a critical lens and what passages intrigued him the most?\n-- How did reading the Bible in 90-days change his perspective?\n-- What do skeptics and apologists often overlook in the evidence for God?\n-- Why is changing someone's worldview so difficult and what's the best approach to do so?\n\nIn this episode you\u2019ll hear about Larry's exciting new project and how his love for philosophy, a hunger for truth, and disillusionment with shallow arguments led him to reconsider the Christian worldview. From confronting evil in the world to exploring the design behind creation, Larry\u2019s journey is both intellectual and deeply personal.
