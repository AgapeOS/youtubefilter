She likes his whiskers too.\nShe uses them for cleaning and stirring up a stew.\n\nWe have a dear old brother who has a Ford machine.\nHe uses Daddy's whiskers to strain the gasoline.\n\nWe have a dear old sister. It really is a laugh.\nShe sprinkles Daddy's whiskers as bath salts in her bath.\n\nWe have another sister. Her name is Ida Mae.\nShe climbs up Daddy's whiskers and braids them every day\n\nAround the supper table, we make a merry group\nUntil dear Daddy's whiskers get tangled in the soup.\n\nDaddy was in battle. He wasn't killed; you see,\nHis whiskers looked like bushes and fooled the enemy.\n\nWhen Daddy goes in swimming, no bathing suit for him.\nHe ties his whiskers 'round his waist and happily jumps in.\n\nThe hottest days of summer are getting pretty good\n'Cause Daddy waves his whiskers and cools the neighbourhood.\n\nkids songs\npreschool songs\ncamp songs\nsing along",

Enjoy!\n\nThe Walking Action Song Lyrics\n\nCan you walk on tiptoe\nAs softly as a cat\nCan you stomp along the road\nJust like that?\nCan you take some huge steps\nLike a giant can?\nOr walk along so slowly\nLike an old, old man?\n\nCan you crawl along the floor\nLike a little worm?\nCan you hop on two feet\nJust like a little bird?\nCan you be a monkey\nAnd swing from tree to tree?\nCan you fly among the flowers\nLike a honey bee?     \n\nCan you wiggle and jiggle \nLike a jelly fish?\nCan you bounce like a kangaroo\nIf you wish?\nCan you swing your trunk\nLike an elephant does?\nCan you fly like a mosquito? \nBuzz! Buzz! Buzz!\nSplat!\n\n\n baby songs kids songs kindergarten",

      "description": "\"Five Red Apples\" is an engaging and interactive counting song designed to captivate young children and help them develop early math skills. Set to a catchy, repetitive tune, the song features a delightful story of five bright red apples hanging on a tree. As the song progresses, one apple at a time is taken away, allowing little ones to count down from five to zero.\n\nThe simple lyrics and cheerful melody make it easy for toddlers to follow along, while the playful repetition reinforces their counting abilities. The song encourages participation, with children counting the apples and singing along to the rhythm. It's a great way to introduce basic numeracy concepts in a fun and memorable way.\n\nPerfect for circle time, home, or any early learning environment, \"Five Red Apples\" combines music, movement, and learning to create a joyful experience for young learners.\n\nFive Red Apples song lyrics for kids :\n\nFive red apples hanging in a tree\nThe juiciest apples that you ever did see.\nThe wind came by with a great big frown\nAnd one little apple came tumbling down \n\nFour red apples, hanging in a tree,\nThe juiciest apples that you ever did see.\nThe wind came by with a great big frown\nAnd one little apple came tumbling down\n\nThree red apples, hanging in a tree,\nThe juiciest apples that you ever did see.\nThe wind came by with a great big frown\nAnd one little apple came tumbling down\n\nTwo red apples, hanging in a tree,\nThe juiciest apples that you ever did see.\nThe wind came by with a great big frown\nAnd one little apple came tumbling down\n\nOne red apple, hanging in a tree,\nThe juiciest apple that you ever did see.\nThe wind came by with a great big frown\nAnd one little apple came tumbling down\n\nNo red apples, hanging in a tree \nI Guess mom is making\nApple pie for me!\n\nAnimation done by Dream Farm\n*******************************************\nKeep on Bouncing with The Kiboomers! \nHere's some of our most popular learning songs :\n\nParty Freeze Dance Song \u2665\ufe0e  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UcZWXvgMZE\nGoing on a Bear Hunt \u2665\ufe0e  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_ShP3fiEhU\nFloor Is Lava Song \u2665\ufe0e  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbNAiN8FTfc\nIf You\u2019re Happy and You Know It \u2665\ufe0e  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHQ1MMqXTw4\nGoing on a Lion Hunt \u2665\ufe0e  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03i5v1PS7P4\n \n\n \nDo your kids like dancing around to catchy tunes like If You\u2019re Happy and You Know It or Baby Shark?
