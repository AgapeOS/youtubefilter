      "description": "Marxist-influenced historians and the supporters of totalitarian central planning have often repeated the conspiracy theory that Hitler was funded into power by a secret cabal of capitalists. Their \"evidence\" for this nonsense is dubious at best, and despite the fact that historian Henry Ashby Turner exposed the lie in 1985, and despite the fact that the majority of historians now begruggingly accept the facts, \"socialists\" are still pushing this narrative, as is Wikipedia. So today, we're going to look at the \"evidence\" and see exactly why the Marxist narrative is wrong once again.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

      "description": "The Battle of Gazala in 1942 was Rommel\u2019s most important battle, and one of the worst defeats in British history, especially for the Royal Tank Regiment. The British 8th Army deployed over 900 tanks in this battle, but was left with just a handful by the end of it. However, Rommel was also close to defeat too and Gazala could have ended in total disaster for him had the British not dropped the ball. Using detailed maps and animations, this video goes over the complete history of the battle, supported by 57 historical sources and 742 citations at the bottom of the screen.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

      "description": "Karl Marx spent his entire life avoiding work, sponging off his friends and family, burdening the lives of everyone he came into contact with, all because Marx wanted to overthrow the current regime (a subconscious rebellion against his parents) and install himself in the seat of ultimate power (as a way to avoid work). He didn't care about the \"workers\", his children, his wife, his parents, nor anybody else. All he cared about was himself, and today's video will show you exactly what happened and why.\n\nArticle mentioned in the video regarding the Industrial Revolution https://mises.org/mises-daily/popular-and-wrong-interpretation-industrial-revolution \n\nClarification for 32:04. Some Hermeticists call the Christian God the \u2018demiurgos\u2019 (the Artisan), while others call the true immaterial God the \u2018demiurgos\u2019... you know, just to confuse us. Well, for the purposes of this video, the name isn\u2019t important. What matters is that, as a Hermeticist, Marx is looking to overcome the \u2018material\u2019 God and get to the true \u2018immaterial\u2019 God. So if in doubt, just ignore where I said \u201cand they call him the Demiurgos\u201d.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

      "description": "After the Fall of Tobruk, Erwin Rommel struck towards El Alamein in June 1942, and the British tried to make a stand at Mersa Matruh. But Rommel smashed through the line and surrounded Bernard Freyberg's New Zealanders at Minqar Qaim and Holmes's 10th Corps at Matruh itself. In desperation, Auchinleck sacked Ritchie and took command of the 8th Army himself to try and stop the Axis advance. This is the in-depth history of that battle.\n\nSlight editing mistake: the date between 15:17 and 18:10 should read the 23rd of June 1942.
