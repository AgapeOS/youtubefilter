      "description": "One popular idea people have is that Hitler and Germany should have invaded Turkey (or maybe get her on her side, which wasn't an option because Turkey wasn't interested) to get to the Caucasus oil fields in the southern Soviet Union. This would theoretically solve the oil crisis that Germany was suffering under. However, there are a few problems with this theory, as this video will explain.\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

Whereas, two other narratives (including the Soviet one, which Vladimir Putin champions) attempt to claim that Poland's aggressive foreign policy resulted in her own destruction.

      "description": "There are a lot of people (including other YouTubers) who are pushing the \"Madman Hitler\" narrative or the \"Madman Druggy Hitler\" narrative (a newer variant), which is quite concerning for reasons I'll explain in this video. Even the book \"Blitzed\" by Norman Ohler, which is where they're supposedly getting their information from, confirms that Hitler was a 'sane' person, even if he was on drugs. I'm also going to be addressing the idea of the Wehrmacht being on drugs (like Pervitin) and discussing whether it really had much of an impact at all on the soldiers of the German Army.\n\nThe groovy thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

      "description": "As the Battle of Stalingrad rages, Franz Halder tries to shift the blame to Hitler and Paulus in order to cover for his own mistakes... at least, that's one theory as to what happened at the Vinnitsa Conference on the 12th of September 1942. But it's not the only event that happened that day. Chuikov is also made 62nd Army's commander, and crosses the Volga into the city of Stalingrad in order to take command of his new forces. We also see the last gasp of the 1st Kotluban Offensive, Zhukov's account about a meeting he had with Stalin (which may not have even happened), and take a look at the state of both German and Soviet formations on the eve of the city fight itself.\n\nCorrection: I displayed the name \u201cKempf\u201d as the author of the final quote, but it was Hoth, not Kempf. I put the correct unit card in, and the reference is correct. It\u2019s just the name under the quote :( when I noticed it was too late to go back and sort it.\n\nTimestamps\n00:00 Part 1 - Events on the 12th of September 1942, including 04:25 the end of the 1st Kotluban Offensive, the meeting at the Kremlin 08:50 , and 11:34 Chuikov's appointment as 62nd Army's commander\n18:05 Part 2 - The Vinnitsa Conference and Halder's shifting of the blame\n41:24 Part 3 - The unit positions on the eve of the city fight & the first real look at the new Stalingrad city map!\n\nThe AMAZING MAPS for this series were created by Terri Young, and the video was edited by her too.

Thinking about it, I now suspect that the lines should have stopped after the Germans took the station, allowing the Soviets to retake it a couple of times at that point, before the lines moved on towards the Volga and the Fallen Fighters Square. Thus, when the 10th NKVD Division (and the dogs) retake the station in the video (e.g. at 42:30 ), the Germans probably weren\u2019t in the buildings on their right flank. I mean, it could have happened this way, but it seems unlikely. I only realized this issue yesterday (the day before publishing), which was too late to change everything around\u2026 which is why I probably need more time to edit these videos than I do... I\u2019ll talk about this in a future addendum video.\n\nThe AMAZING MAPS and thumbnails for this series were created by Terri Young, and the video was edited by her too.

      "description": "Some believe that Hitler's distrust of his generals, and his constant attempts to control them, are evidence of his 'madness'. This is the result of purely looking at the military operations and not understanding the political side of the equation. To explain this, in this documentary we will explore the situation in the last years of the Weimar Republic, see the conflict between Hitler and Kurt von Schleicher (a conservative army officer), see how similar or dis-similar their goals were, and figure out the reason why Hitler didn't trust his generals.

The Germans were in the centre of the city, were pushing onto Mamaev Kurgan, and were collapsing 62nd Army's defenses in the south. Chuikov had nothing left, and so it looked like the city was about to fall. There was only one hope. Rodimtsev's 13th Guards Rifle Division would have to cross the Volga and perform an amphibious landing and charge straight into battle. The only question is - did they have enough rifles? Or was the film \"Enemy at the Gates\" correct in assuming there was one guy with a rifle and one guy with bullets?

      "description": "It's well known that they German Army had poor logistics in WW2. So could they have improved it? Doing so would have helped them on the Eastern Front. So should they have built more trains, trucks, roads, railroads? Should they have had an army of engineers? Well, the answer probably isn't what you're expecting. Today, we're going to talk about the \"economic calculation problem\" and why the German Army (or any current army) can't have efficient logistics.\n\nThank you to my Patreon, Diego Torres-Siclait, for today's question!\nWant to ask a question?

      "description": "In today's documentary on the Battle of Stalingrad, we witness the beginning of the 2nd Kotluban Offensive, continued fighting inside the Grain Elevator, and Paulus making a mistake. We're also going to discuss why it is that the German attack bogged down BEFORE they even reached the city.\n\nERROR: The Soviet casualty numbers for the 2nd Kotluban Offensive are incorrect! It's quite complicated to explain why, so please see this addendum video for the correct numbers https://youtu.be/e3RbcNbMUtk\nAnd thank you to all of you who questioned me about this. When I went back and checked the numbers, I realized that the numbers were wrong. I'll be putting a warning up at the beginning of next episode too \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe MAPs for this series were created by Terri Young, and the video was edited by her too.

      "description": "Some people (including people like David Hoggan) can\u2019t understand why Britain would declare war on Germany in 1939. They argue that it was a secret plot to bully Germany, and that Britain was the instigator of the war, and that they should have just let Germany go East. Well, this argument quickly falls apart when we look at the map of Europe and think critically, which this video will show.\n\nCorrection: As many people have pointed out, I said 1938 instead of 1939 at 9:20 in the video. It was 1939, not 1938.

      "description": "It's been 10 days since Franz Halder predicted that Stalingrad would fall in 10 days, and Stalingrad hasn't fallen in 10 days. Worse, the Axis are struggling to take the centre and south of the city, whilst holding against the 2nd Kotluban Offensive, and pull divisions away from the Don flank. Even with the 3rd Romanian Army moving in, there's simply not enough divisions to go around. Worse, the replacements the Germans are sending to the Eastern Front aren't reaching Army Group B and it's the OKH's fault. So overall, Halder was in trouble, which is why he had to go.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe MAPs for this series were created by Terri Young, and the video was edited by her too.

      "description": "Hjalmar Schacht was Hitler's banker between the years 1933 and 1939. He was also the Reichsminister of Economics between 1934 and 1937, playing a central role in financing the Third Reich's rearmament programme in the build up to war. Schacht also helped set up the Bank of International Settlements (the BIS) in 1930. So why did Hitler hire him? And why did Hitler fire him?

      "description": "In 1934, Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht introduced the MEFO bills scheme to fund the German government's rearmament programme. There are various interpretations regarding this scheme, and there hasn't been a decent explanation of how they worked. Some say they were inflationary, while others claim they were not. This video aims to clarify what the scheme was about, how it worked and whether the MEFO bills could be classed as inflationary or not.\n\nThe link to the free PDF of Murray Rothbar's \"America's Great Depression\" https://mises.org/library/americas-great-depression\n\nNOTE: Technically the cause of a recession or depression is the expansion of the currency supply AND the manipulation of interest rates.

This then \"disproves\" the idea I presented in a previous video ( The Axis Population outnumbered the Soviet Population in 1942 https://youtu.be/Ux0cwy8jHnw ) which was that the Axis actually outnumbered the Soviets, and could replace their manpower losses until 1943.

      "description": "Some people (like Greg Hallett) believe that Hitler was a British agent (his book currently has four stars on Amazon). Many also claim that if only we read certain books or watched certain documentaries, we would get \"the Truth\". Well, today we're going to look into this argument and judge it by its own merit. Will it stand up to scrutiny? Or is the theory nothing more than a joke? Let's find out.\n\nFor the YouTube Censors: if you watch the video, it should become obvious that I don't subscribe to this theory. I'm also NOT a Nazi, a Fascist, a Marxist, nor do I subscribe to any other evil totalitarian ideology or worldview.

      "description": "It is usually stated that \u2018Madman Hitler\u2019 wasted a load of resources and production capacity building the German heavy and super-heavy tanks in WW2. When we consider the oil crisis, and the fuel and logistical situation, this seems self-evident: Hitler must have been insane to build massive tanks at a time when he knew there was a lack of fuel (either that or the oil crisis narrative is wrong)! But is this really the case? Well, here in this video I\u2019m going to defend my stance on the Axis oil crisis narrative, and explain why the initial reasons for building the German heavy and super-heavy tanks were justified (even if they later proved to be stupid in hindsight).\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Subscribe for more History content: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfZz8F37oSJ2rtcEJHM2kCg?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail was created by Terri Young.

      "description": "From the 18th to the 23rd of October 1942, a stalemate occurs both within the city of Stalingrad, and outside of it. Fighting for the Barrikady Factory becomes confusing, and Rokossovsky launches another offensive - the Fourth Kotluban Offensive.

      "description": "The German Revolution of 1918 guaranteed that the Weimar Hyperinflation would happen. Why? Because the political ideologues who came to power and founded the Weimar Republic were also the ones calling for the policies that caused it, and were completely clueless on how to stop it. So, in order to fully understand the Weimar Hyperinflation, we need to understand them - who these ideologues were, what they believed, and what they were up to. And in this video, the second in the series on the Weimar Hyperinflation, we\u2019re going to do just that by looking at the REAL history of the German 1918 Revolution and the Spartacist Uprising of 1919.\n\nThe script for this video was 6,358 words.\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

We\u2019re going to answer the question: was the Weimar Republic weak? And we\u2019re also going to hear the story of how one man single-handedly saved Austria from a Bolshevik Revolution.

      "description": "Rainer Zitelmann's \"Hitler's National Socialism\" is a republishing of his original \"Hitler: The Policies of Seduction\" which I've been recommending for years. Finally, you can get your hands on what is in my opinion by far the best book assessing Hitler and his ideology.\n\nDisclaimers: I'm NOT a Nazi, nor a Fascist, nor a Marxist, or a believer in any other ideology. The purpose of this video is to educate people and learn from history so that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past.\n\nThis is NOT a sponsored video and I'm NOT making any commission by recommending this book. I am genuinely recommending this based on the fact that it has contributed significantly to the historiography surrounding this topic. I've used the first edition of this book for years now (since 2019 at least) and have been recommending it since then. Want proof? Here's a 5 hour video on Hitler's Socialism where I quote from the book multiple times: https://youtu.be/eCkyWBPaTC8\n\nFollow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/tikhistory/\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

Paulus has brought in several pioneer battalions in an attempt to take the last bits of the city of Stalingrad, but there prove to be no substitute to regular infantry.

      "description": "The bombing of Dresden in 1945 resulted in a firestorm that wiped out the 7th largest city in Germany. This event sparked a massive historical debate over whether it was legitimate or not, whether it was a war crime or not, and whether there were 25,000 fatalities, or 400,000! Using on-screen references, this historical documentary presents the real story of what happened in Dresden on the 13th of February 1945, and examines the evidence to conclude a reasonable estimate of the fatalities, and whether the Dresden bombing was a war crime or not.\n\nFollow me on Instagram https://www.instagram.com/tikhistory/\n\n\u23f2\ufe0f Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).\n\nThe thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

      "description": "\"I am a socialist.\u201d - Hitler, from his \"Zweites Buch\" (Second Book) Page 50.\n\nSome continue to believe that Hitler and National Socialism wasn't REAL Socialism. Some believe that the totalitarian State of the Third Reich had no power at all, and that the market was 'free'. They want to believe that Hitler and his State \"privatised\" the industries, and had NO control over the economy. Worse, they even think that Nazism didn't call for the creation of a 'People's State' after the conquest of Lebensraum. Yes, 80 years after the events in question, many are still pushing a contradictory narrative that directly goes against the overwhelming evidence pointing towards the complete opposite conclusion, and then refuse to even consider the possibility that they might be wrong in their interpretation. Well, having produced a 5 hour video on this subject (link https://youtu.be/eCkyWBPaTC8 ) only for it to be ignored and dismissed by my critics, and my supporters requesting a shorter version, I've created a condensed and updated video that hits all the main points. Using numerous primary and secondary sources, this video shows the substantial amount of flaws in the Marxist-denialist argument, and presents a solid interpretation of the evidence that makes much more sense than the denialist argument ever has.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

Their \"evidence\" for this nonsense is dubious at best, and despite the fact that historian Henry Ashby Turner exposed the lie in 1985, and despite the fact that the majority of historians now begruggingly accept the facts, \"socialists\" are still pushing this narrative, as is Wikipedia.

However, Rommel was also close to defeat too and Gazala could have ended in total disaster for him had the British not dropped the ball.

      "description": "Karl Marx spent his entire life avoiding work, sponging off his friends and family, burdening the lives of everyone he came into contact with, all because Marx wanted to overthrow the current regime (a subconscious rebellion against his parents) and install himself in the seat of ultimate power (as a way to avoid work). He didn't care about the \"workers\", his children, his wife, his parents, nor anybody else. All he cared about was himself, and today's video will show you exactly what happened and why.\n\nArticle mentioned in the video regarding the Industrial Revolution https://mises.org/mises-daily/popular-and-wrong-interpretation-industrial-revolution \n\nClarification for 32:04. Some Hermeticists call the Christian God the \u2018demiurgos\u2019 (the Artisan), while others call the true immaterial God the \u2018demiurgos\u2019... you know, just to confuse us. Well, for the purposes of this video, the name isn\u2019t important. What matters is that, as a Hermeticist, Marx is looking to overcome the \u2018material\u2019 God and get to the true \u2018immaterial\u2019 God. So if in doubt, just ignore where I said \u201cand they call him the Demiurgos\u201d.\n\nThis video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature.

In desperation, Auchinleck sacked Ritchie and took command of the 8th Army himself to try and stop the Axis advance.
