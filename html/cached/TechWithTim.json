This assistant will have aging capabilities, meaning it will be able to interact with a database, call Python functions, and essentially do anything you want. After we build the AI voice assistant, which actually won't take that long, I'll demonstrate how to integrate it into your own custom front end so you can see how to interact with it in the real world. This is super cool, and I guarantee you're going to learn a ton. You'll see how simple it is to create these agents, even if you're not a complete AI expert.\n\n\ud83c\udf9e Video Resources \ud83c\udf9e\nCode in This Video: https://github.com/techwithtim/LiveKit-AI-Car-Call-Centre/tree/main\nGet Started With LiveKit: https://livekit.io/?utm_campaign=techwithtim\nLiveKit Docs: https://docs.livekit.io/home/?utm_campaign=techwithtim\nLiveKit React Components: https://docs.livekit.io/reference/components/react/?utm_campaign=techwithtim\nLiveKit Agent Playground: https://agents-playground.livekit.io/?utm_campaign=techwithtim\nOpenAI API Key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\n\n\ud83d\udcec Join my Newsletter: https://techwithtim.net/newsletter\n \nGet my free training here: https://training.techwithtim.net/free-guide\n\n\u23f3 Timestamps \u23f3\n00:00 | Overview\n00:36 | Project Demo\n03:17 | LiveKit Overview & Setup\n05:17 | Project Keys & Credentials\n08:20 | LiveKit Architecture\n10:39 | Python Backend Setup\n13:00 | Building the Voice Assistant Agent\n24:09 | Testing the Agent (LiveKit Playground)\n26:23 | Adding Agent Tools & Database\n45:18 | Designing the Agent Decision Tree\n54:34 | Frontend Integration\n1:30:15 | LiveKit Token Authentication & Issuing\n1:47:26 | Connecting Your Agent to a Phone Number\n\nHashtags\n#python #pythonprogramming #ai",

I'll show you how to use various \rLLMs like Claude or GPT, how you can give the agent access to various tools, and how you can structure the output of the agent\r so you can use it in your code.\n\n\ud83c\udf9e Video Resources \ud83c\udf9e\nCode in this video: https://github.com/techwithtim/PythonAIAgentFromScratch\nLearn Python Virtual Environments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y21OR1OPC9A\nGet Your Anthropic API Key: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys\nGet Your OpenAI API Key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys\n\n\u23f3 Timestamps \u23f3\n00:00 | Overview\n00:35 | Agent Demo\n01:38 | Setup/Requirements\n06:53 | Basic Code Setup/Imports\n08:37 | Using Claude or GPT\n10:00 | Getting Your API Key\n11:32 | Basic LLM Functionality\n12:43 | Structured Output/Models\n15:42 | Prompt Templates\n17:33 | Creating & Running the Agent\n21:00 | Output Parsing\n23:39 | Adding Prebuilt Tools\n30:48 | Custom Tool Calling\n\nHashtags\n#CodingWithCopilot #Sponsored",
