In this video, we will be practicing the butterfly pose, a perfect pose to stretch our legs and calm our minds, just like a butterfly preparing to take flight.\n\nAfter chomping through our cocoon, we'll hop it up using our legs into a handstand, before sitting to uncurl our wings and show off all the beautiful colours.\n\nAs we hold this pose, we will imagine ourselves transforming, just like the very hungry caterpillar in the book. We will picture ourselves growing and changing, just like the caterpillar does as it eats and eats, before finally becoming a beautiful butterfly.\n\nThis pose is perfect for children of all ages and abilities, and can be done at home, in the classroom, or even outside in nature. So come join us as we practice the butterfly pose and celebrate the beauty of transformation, just like the Very Hungry Caterpillar!\n\nRemember to always listen to your body and go at your own pace.

Well, I have a fun trick to help kids stay calm and relaxed - it's called petal breaths!\n\nTo start, hold out one hand and make a closed fist. As you breathe in slowly through your nose open up your palms nice and wide. As you breathe out, you close them up like a tulip bulb! \n\nYou can do this exercise quietly in the car to feel instantly calmer and more relaxed. Try it out a few times until you can feel the difference in your breathing and body. Petal breathing is a cool tool to help you manage stress not just in the car, but in lots of other situations too!\n\nSo next time you're feeling anxious in the car, remember to take a deep breath and give petal breathing a try.

      "description": "Introducing a unique and engaging way for kids to learn their ABCs - through yoga poses!\n\nEach letter of the alphabet can be represented by a corresponding yoga pose. For example, \"A\" can be represented by the \"Aeroplane\" pose, where kids can stretch their arms and legs into an aeroplane shape. \"B\" will be represented by the \"Boat\" pose, where kids can make the shape of a boat while seated on the floor. The letter \"C\" can be demonstrated with \"Cat\" pose - where we are on our hands and knees, arching our backs - like a cat! \n\nAs we go through each letter, we'll provide step-by-step instructions and demonstration of each pose, making it easy and fun for kids to follow along. Not only will they be learning their ABCs, but they'll also be developing their flexibility, strength, and coordination skills.\n\nWhether your child is a yoga enthusiast or new to the practice, this is perfect for kids of all ages and skill levels. By incorporating yoga poses into their ABC learning, kids will have a blast while getting some exercise and improving their cognitive abilities at the same time.\n\nSo, grab your yoga mat and get ready to have fun as we explore the alphabet through yoga poses! Check out all of our videos for the alphabet on our channel, or go on a yoga adventure!\n\n\u2b50 Subscribe to the Cosmic Kids Youtube Channel \u2b50 https://www.youtube.com/user/cosmickidsyoga\n\n\ud83c\udf08 Watch Ad-Free on the Cosmic Kids app: https://app.cosmickids.com\n\ud83d\udcf7  Instagram: https://instagram.com/cosmickidsyoga\n\u2728 FREE Yoga Quest Download: https://cosmickids.com/yogaquest/\n\ud83d\udc64  Facebook: https://facebook.com/cosmickidsyoga/\n\ud83d\udc9d Lots more at: https://cosmickids.com\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83c\udf08 The Cosmic Kids app: https://app.cosmickids.com\n\ud83c\udfac The complete Cosmic Kids video library. \n\ud83d\udcf1 View on any computer, TV, smartphone and tablet. \n\ud83d\udeb8 Safe viewing: no commercials, links or suggested videos. \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udcd7 Learn to teach kids yoga with me! \ud83d\udcd7\nhttps://cosmickids.com/learn/\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------",

      "description": "If your kids have ever felt anxious or stressed during car rides, then I have a fun trick to help them stay calm and relaxed - it's called finger breathing!\n\nTo start, hold out one hand and use the index finger of your other hand to trace up the outside of your fingers as you breathe in slowly through your nose. Then, trace down the inside of your fingers as you breathe out slowly through your mouth.\n\nYou can do this exercise quietly in the car without anyone even noticing. Try it out a few times until you feel more calm and relaxed. Finger breathing is a cool tool to help you manage stress not just in the car, but in lots of other situations too!\n\nSo next time you're feeling anxious in the car, remember to take a deep breath and give finger breathing a try.

Being the Pond is the perfect way to think about our emotions, how many of them we have and how they work. \n\nWe imagine our emotions as different fish, swimming around our minds (the pond!). There's a happy fish, a sad fish, a sleepy fish, a calm fish, a kind fish, a selfish fish, an angry fish and more... So many fish swimming around the pond.

And do it well - happy days! \n\nTo get good at focusing, practice Body Scanning!\n\nImagine your focus is a torch light. Shine your light on each part of your body one at a time. Start with your feet and work up slowly. Not forgetting your arms, your hands and your face! I like to do this, lying on the sofa - and it's really relaxing too.

      "description": "Be The Pond is our second most shared video on YouTube (second only to our Frozen yoga adventure, which is a classic of course!). The reason Be The Pond is shared so often by parents and teachers is because it's such a simple and effective mindfulness tool. \n\nTalking to kids about big feelings and how they can properly process and understand them isn't easy, but be the pond can really help. I actually use this mindfulness tool even as a grown up all the time! \n\nI get loads of messages about how their kids or class have reminded them when they feel frustrated or anxious to 'be the pond' \ud83d\udc9c \ud83d\udc1f\n\nHere's a wonderful clip of Cosi explaining a bit more about 'be the pond' and how it works in practice! \n\nA huge THANK-YOU to @christinasonthemove over on Instagram for sharing and of course to Cosi (aka @crushofthestingingwasp!) \ud83d\udc9c \n\nScreentime that gives kids SUPERPOWERS!\n\n\u2b07\ufe0f Download the Cosmic Kids App \u2b07\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udf4fApple: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cosmic-kids/\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0fAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cosmickids\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Desktop (great for teachers!): https://app.cosmickids.com/\n\ud83d\udcfa Roku: https://rb.gy/44r8d\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy watch on the App? \u2b07\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udfac Access the complete Cosmic Kids video library including exclusive episodes\n\ud83d\udcf1 View on any computer, TV, smartphone and tablet\n\ud83d\udeb8 Safe viewing: no commercials, links or suggested videos\n\ud83d\udcaa Support us to keep making content!\n\nFollow Jaime! \u2764\ufe0f\n\u2022 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/cosmickidsyoga/\n\u2022 Twitter - https://twitter.com/CosmicKidsYoga\n\u2022  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cosmickidsyoga/\n\u2022  TikTok! - https://www.tiktok.com/@cosmickidsyogatiktok\n\nLearn to Teach Kids Yoga with Jaime \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\nhttps://cosmickids.com/learn/ \n\nWork with Jaime:\nhttps://cosmickids.com/partnerships/",

      "description": "Did you know the story behind the dragon's place in the Emperor Jade's legendary race that created the Chinese Zodiac? Despite being able to fly and swim, the mighty dragon finished fifth. Why, you ask? \ud83e\udd14\ud83c\udfc1\n\nThe dragon, ever so kind and helpful, spotted a village in need during the race. Despite its lead, it stopped to bring rain to the villagers, aiding them in their time of drought. Then, on its way to the finish line, the dragon saw the rabbit struggling to cross a river and gently helped it across. \ud83c\udf27\ufe0f\ud83d\udc07\n\nThis tale teaches us the importance of kindness, compassion, and the true spirit of helping others, even when we're racing towards our own goals. The dragon's fifth place is a reminder that winning isn't always about being first; it's about doing what's right. \ud83c\udfc6\u2764\ufe0f\n\nI loved making this episode because I got to give the animals in the race a fun voice to help make each character's story more memorable - I went with a smart London accent for the dragon! \ud83d\udc09\nThe full Lunar New Year episode is on YouTube and our app too. \n\n#YearOfTheDragon #ChineseNewYear #KindnessMatters\n\nScreentime that gives kids SUPERPOWERS!\n\u2b07\ufe0f Download the Cosmic Kids App \u2b07\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udf4fApple: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cosmic-kids/\n\ud83d\udecd\ufe0fAndroid: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cosmickids\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f Desktop (great for teachers!): https://app.cosmickids.com/\n\ud83d\udcfa Roku: https://rb.gy/44r8d\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWhy watch on the App? \u2b07\ufe0f\n\ud83c\udfac Access the complete Cosmic Kids video library including exclusive episodes\n\ud83d\udcf1 View on any computer, TV, smartphone and tablet\n\ud83d\udeb8 Safe viewing: no commercials, links or suggested videos\n\ud83d\udcaa Support us to keep making content!\n\nFollow Jaime! \u2764\ufe0f\n\u2022 Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/cosmickidsyoga/\n\u2022 Twitter - https://twitter.com/CosmicKidsYoga\n\u2022  Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/cosmickidsyoga/\n\u2022  TikTok! - https://www.tiktok.com/@cosmickidsyogatiktok\n\nLearn to Teach Kids Yoga with Jaime \ud83e\uddd8\u200d\u2640\nhttps://cosmickids.com/learn/ \n\nWork with Jaime:\nhttps://cosmickids.com/partnerships/",
