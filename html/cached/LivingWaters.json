      "description": "A large news company, Politico, recently \u201cdug up some dirt\u201d on Living Waters, Ray Comfort, and Mike Johnson...but many details weren\u2019t properly shared, as Ray explains in this video.\n\n**** You and Living Waters were recently targeted by Politico. What was your reaction to the article?\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t surprise me in the slightest. It\u2019s expected that certain media outlets will slant and misrepresent certain facts to suit their own purposes. This was the case with this article. But the real facts are available for everyone to plainly see in the videos they referenced, as I highlight in my response video.\u00a0\n\n**** What's your reaction to the lede: House Speaker Mike Johnson sits on the board of a Christian publishing house that suggested getting \u201cmonkeypox\u201d was \u201can inevitable and appropriate penalty\u201d for being gay and that former President Barack Obama was rumored to be the Antichrist because of his \u201cleanings toward Islam.\u201d in particular?\n\nConflict gets news articles read, and this created conflict. However, the video to which they linked is a most loving interaction I had with two homosexuals who both listened respectably, and were clearly thankful for our conversation.\u00a0\n\nThe monkey pox issue was posed as a question rather than a statement.\n\nThe list for Antichrist candidates down through the ages has included every man and his dog. That was just part of the list I\u2019d heard over the last fifty years.\u00a0\u00a0Barack Obama and Donald Trump have been rumored to be candidates\u2014political bias certainly comes into play as to whether they are potential candidates. Obama made it because of an item I saw on CNN.\n\n**** Why do you think the media are coming down so hard on Johnson?\n\nIt\u2019s par for the course for any Christian. The Bible says, \u201cAll who live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution\u201d (2 Timothy 3:12). Mike is a very high profile godly man, so it\u2019s to be expected from a sin-loving world.\n\n**** You were described as a \"far-right organization.\" What do you make of that?\n\nIf far-right means that we don\u2019t want babies killed in the womb\u2014that we only want that which is right\u00a0in the sight of God,\u00a0then so be it\u2014we are far right.\u00a0\n\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter",

Too often, our culture encourages us to look inward for salvation, rather than outward to the Lord for direction.

      "description": "In this intriguing street encounter, E.Z. Zwayne meets a self-proclaimed panentheist who also happens to be a fan of ghost-hunting. As the conversation turns to spiritual matters, the woman quickly dismisses Christianity as too \"new\" for her, asserting that her pantheistic beliefs are grounded in ancient traditions. Despite her resistance, E.Z. engages her in a thought-provoking discussion, drawing a comparison between the popular Ghostbusters and the Holy Ghost, and presenting the Gospel. Watch as the conversation takes a turn when the Gospel begins to challenge her beliefs, and see how she responds.\n\nWatch until the end of the video to learn how you can win a FREE copy of EZ's new book, \ud835\ude0d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude28\ud835\ude29\ud835\ude35 \ud835\ude13\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude2c\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude22 \ud835\ude14\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f: \ud835\ude08 \ud835\ude09\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude25 \ud835\ude09\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude23\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude24\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d \ud835\ude09\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude26 \ud835\ude17\ud835\ude2d\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2f \ud835\ude27\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude33 \ud835\ude17\ud835\ude26\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude34\ud835\ude30\ud835\ude2f\ud835\ude22\ud835\ude2d \ud835\ude17\ud835\ude36\ud835\ude33\ud835\ude2a\ud835\ude35\ud835\ude3a.\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter",

He uses the same three-pronged approach he used in Eden:\n\nDiscontent: \"Has God really said?\"\nDisbelief: \"You won't face the consequences.\"\nDeification: \"You can be like God and decide what's right.\"\nThis pattern is especially clear with sexual temptations. But James 4:7 reminds us, \"Submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.\" Stay vigilant, and honor God in every part of your life.\n\nTo dive deeper into this topic, check out EZ's new book Fight Like a Man: A Bold, Biblical Battle Plan for Personal Purity available at Livingwaters.com.",

      "description": "Donald Trump and Kamala Harris' debate captured the attention of many Americans. In this video, Ray Comfort reflects alongside well-known atheists on what should be a more central issue in these discussions. If the gospel truly offers the ultimate hope, and many candidates claim Christianity, why isn\u2019t it at the forefront of these debates? This is not an attempt to disparage either candidate but to highlight the only true hope for America\u2014Jesus and the gospel. It\u2019s essential to vote in a way that glorifies God.

It got me thinking\u2014what would I have said if I were in Charlie's shoes? One of the students even questioned whether the church is a scam and Christianity's promises of eternal life. Here's what I would have answered and how I would have presented the gospel in that moment. Watch as we dive into the core of the debate, touching on big questions like morality, the existence of God, and eternal life. Stay tuned to hear Charlie's response to some tough questions and see how the gospel can be shared effectively, even in the middle of a heated discussion.

      "description": "The moral failure of a well-known pastor can send shockwaves through the church, leaving a trail of hurt in its wake. It\u2019s a tragedy for the pastor\u2019s wife, family, congregation, and the broader church at large. How do we respond when a spiritual leader is caught in a biblically disqualifying sin?  Many are left asking, \"If a pastor of that stature falls, how can I stand firm in my faith?\" We'll explore this common concern and talk about how to trust God, even when spiritual giants stumble. We'll also look at how to discern truth and theology apart from the failings of flawed individuals. Join us in today\u2019s video as we discuss the painful reality of pastoral failure, the importance of prayer for the victims, and the need for grace mixed with truth when dealing with the wrongdoer.\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter\n\nWatch the Gospel in your native language with our international playlist:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIMAX6WHtnhCXm_3kfhqmjWtHYKieyMpv&si=u4jqrSia4xr9SwJl",

These are common questions people wrestle with in the face of devastating events like hurricanes Milan and Milton, which are destroying livelihoods at record levels. In this video, Ray Comfort explains how we should understand hurricanes and reminds us that God is in more control than we might realize.

We\u2019ll explore three reasons some believers say Christians shouldn\u2019t participate in elections, but before we get there, we\u2019ll also consider why many argue Christians should vote. You'll witness a thought-provoking exchange between Ray and an atheist that you won\u2019t want to miss. His response to a question about God and our brains might surprise you!\n\nBut here's the reality: sitting out on voting can have devastating consequences. When millions of babies are aborted, young lives are destroyed by gender ideology, and Christians face persecution, those who choose inaction will share in the responsibility. With elections shaping the future of life, morality, and religious freedom, the stakes have never been higher.\n\nWe just launched our streaming platform https://livingwaters.tv\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter\n\nWatch the Gospel in your native language with our international playlist:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIMAX6WHtnhCXm_3kfhqmjWtHYKieyMpv&si=u4jqrSia4xr9SwJl",

But look at these three prophetic and sobering words we mustn\u2019t overlook:\n\n\u201cIn the last days perilous times will come \u2026 evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse\u2026\u201d (2 Timothy 3:1,13)\n\nThe Bible doesn\u2019t say that things will get better in the last days, but \u201cworse and worse.\u201d That tells us that humanity will become more corrupt. Rotten will become putrid. The issue is deeper than what concerned most of us leading up to the election\u2014abortion. Christians are the big hindrance to same-sex marriage, the normalization of homosexuality, gender identity, euthanasia, assisted suicide, sex education, and many other issues.\n\nThis is why we mustn\u2019t forget our agenda. Jesus said to preach the gospel to every creature. This is because the gospel is the power of God to salvation. It not only saves from wrath, but it has the power to transform sin-loving sinners so that they love righteousness.\n\nWatch the full sermon given by Pastor Tony Wood: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlqDzqPgy1o\n\nWe just launched our streaming platform https://livingwaters.tv\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter\n\nWatch the Gospel in your native language with our international playlist:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIMAX6WHtnhCXm_3kfhqmjWtHYKieyMpv&si=u4jqrSia4xr9SwJl",

      "description": "The devastating fires in Los Angeles have deeply impacted our hearts. We're praying for everyone affected, especially those who\u2019ve lost their loved ones, their homes or have been displaced by these tragic events. While our ministry, Living Waters, is based in LA County, we are thankfully on the opposite side, far from the fires, and we truly appreciate your prayers.\n\nIn this video, Ray Comfort highlights a striking connection between celebrities mocking God at the Golden Globe Awards and later turning to prayer when the fires threaten their homes. These moments serve as a sobering reminder of life's fragility.\n\nAs Scripture says, \u201cThe grass withers and the flowers fall, but the word of our God endures forever\u201d (Isaiah 40:8). In the face of loss, Christ is more than enough.\n\nWatch as Ray Comfort interviews a woman who had to evacuate her home in the hills and shares the message of hope that can save her soul from the eternal flame.\n\nDownload our app and stream all our content: https://livingwaters.tv\n\nTry out EQUIP where we train you with the best answers to the hardest questions from the top voices of our day: https://livingwaters.tv/pages/equip-special\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter\n\nWatch the Gospel in your native language with our international playlist:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIMAX6WHtnhCXm_3kfhqmjWtHYKieyMpv&si=u4jqrSia4xr9SwJl",

      "description": "Ray Comfort has been accused of mocking God more than Hollywood in light of the Los Angeles fires. But is there any truth to this claim? In the video \"Hollywood Mocks God, and This Happens,\" Ray clarifies his original position, explaining that while we cannot definitively say the LA fires are God's judgment, we do know that God sends both rain and sunshine. It's challenging to attribute God's judgment of Hollywood to a single event. However, over the past 40+ years, Hollywood has consistently mocked God, distorted truth, glorified sensuality, and exalted sin. Could this be storing up the wrath of God, as the Bible warns?\n\nIn this video, Ray Comfort addresses these claims and uses this moment to share the hope of the gospel in a world desperate for truth and redemption.\n\nOur hearts also go out to the families who have lost their homes during these tragic events.\n\nDownload our app and stream all our content: https://livingwaters.tv\n\nTry out EQUIP where we train you with the best answers to the hardest questions from the top voices of our day: https://livingwaters.tv/pages/equip-special\n\nGet The Evidence Study Bible here: https://livingwaters.com/collections/the-evidence-bible/\nGet the Starter Kit of gospel tracts here: https://livingwaters.com/store/gospel-tracts/starter-kit/\n\nCheck out The Living Waters Podcast: https://www.LivingWaters.com/Podcast\n\nVisit https://www.LivingWaters.com to view more free Christian videos, articles, and to get tracts and other resources by Ray Comfort and the Living Waters team.\n\nFACEBOOK\nLiving Waters: https://www.facebook.com/lwwotm\nRay Comfort: https://www.facebook.com/official.Ray.Comfort\n\nINSTAGRAM\nLiving Waters: https://www.instagram.com/livingwatersofficial\n\nX (formerly Twitter)\nLiving Waters: https://x.com/LivingWatersPub\nRay Comfort: https://x.com/RayComfort\n\nReceive weekly updates about fresh articles, videos, and audios, as well as new resources, special discounts, and upcoming events: https://www.livingwaters.com/weekly-newsletter\n\nWatch the Gospel in your native language with our international playlist:  https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIMAX6WHtnhCXm_3kfhqmjWtHYKieyMpv&si=u4jqrSia4xr9SwJl",

      "description": "The modern gospel often begins with, \u201cGod loves you and has a wonderful plan for your life.\u201d But what if that plan includes being stoned like Stephen, whipped like Paul, or imprisoned like countless believers through history? Walk someone through the book of Acts, or trace the word \u201csuffering\u201d through the Epistles, and then ask them to say, \u201cWonderful.\u201d After such a journey, the pleasures of sin may seem more appealing than the call to \u201csuffer affliction with the people of God.\u201d\n\nThis soft-sell gospel message centered on happiness instead of holiness has produced something tragic: countless false converts in the American church. When we bypass the Law and fail to confront sin, we fill churches with people who think they\u2019re saved... but aren\u2019t. They came for a better life, not eternal life. They never saw their guilt before a holy God, never trembled at judgment, and never truly repented.\n\nJesus didn\u2019t promise comfort. He brought conviction. He used the Ten Commandments to expose the heart, reveal sin, and show the righteousness of God (Luke 10:25\u201327; 18:18\u201320). Only then can someone truly see their need for the Savior.\n\nThe cross is the ultimate expression of God\u2019s love (John 3:16; Rom. 5:8; 1 John 4:10) but that love is meaningless unless we understand what it cost, and why it was necessary. How can we speak of the cross without sin? And how can we understand sin without the Law (Rom. 7:7)? As Ray Comfort says, \u201cThe Law is the needle, and the gospel is the thread, you can\u2019t sew without both.\u201d\n\nIf we preach a gospel that skips over sin, judgment, and the fear of the Lord, we may gain decisions, but we lose true conversions. The gospel doesn\u2019t promise an easy life; it offers eternal life through repentance, righteousness, and the grace of God in Christ. And that is truly wonderful.",
