In this fun educational video for kids, we'll learn about adding and subtracting with some super fun vehicles as they smash through giant bowling pins in the city.  Featuring a tiny Smart Car, a shiny yellow bulldozer, a cool monster truck, a fire truck with flashing lights and a giant dump truck.  We'll use adding as a quick way to count objects and we'll use subtracting to figure out which vehicle knocks down the most bowling pins.  We'll also learn about sizes - small, medium and large.\n\nIf you and your children enjoy this video, I'd love to hear from you in the comments.  Even if they don't like it, I welcome any feedback so I can make my videos more engaging and educational in the future.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nBrain Candy TV is dedicated to producing fun and engaging educational videos that your kids will love.

      "description": "Join Lizzy the Dog at the construction site to learn all about excavators and hydraulics. Our vehicle assembly series is designed to get curious kids excited about learning how things work and inspire an early love of the STEM fields. \n\nThe first section will focus on the main parts of an excavator and how they work as we assemble a big realistic excavator at the construction site in the city. Then we'll learn the engineering behind the powerful system of hydraulics employed by excavators.  After that, your kids will love watching our new \"virtual Lizzy the Dog\" as she hops inside the excavator to show us how an excavator works.  She'll show us what all of the controls do before we see the excavator in action as it digs up some big heavy rocks for the dump truck to carry away.\n\nNow that Lizzy is over 12 years old, she'll be retiring from \"show business,\" but I hope to continue her legacy of bringing joy and education to children around the world with our new animated Lizzy character.  She's not quite as cute as the real thing, but my new friend Elmer Frihdson Ona and I worked hard for months to lovingly recreate Lizzy in digital form, so you'll be seeing more of her in future videos. Check out Elmer's animation work on UpWork here: https://www.upwork.com/fl/elmerfrihdsonona  Let me know what you and your kids think of the new character. With some practice, I hope to get better at animating her more organically so she'll be improving over time.\n\nThis video continues what I hope will be many more videos in the STEM fields.  As our original \"Brainiacs\" outgrow our preschool topics, we hope to continue their education and inspire a lasting wonder of the natural world, science and technology. \n\nMy goal with this channel is to jump-start your child\u2019s education so they can grow up to be more confident and successful in school, and in life. Recent studies have shown that learning between birth and 3 years old is crucial to your child\u2019s cognitive and emotional development, so let\u2019s make the most of their screen time by giving them the head start they deserve!\n\nIf you or your children enjoyed this video, please let me know in the comments below.

We'll learn about the different parts of a monster truck as we put our very own custom monster truck together. We'll also learn how an internal combustion engine works. Then we'll take our truck to the Monster Truck Training Academy to watch it perform some awesome stunts using our highly detailed monster truck and a hyper-realistic vehicle simulation. \n\nAll of the monster truck parts work, shake and break realistically - engine, exhaust, shock absorbers, drive shafts, hydraulic steering, squishy tires, you name it.  Perfect for learning all about how a real monster truck works! Our awesome monster truck will perform all sorts of stunts from jumps, nose wheelies, donuts, car crushing and lots more.\n\nIt's my hope that this vehicle assembly series will help kids get excited about engineering and learning how things work.
