Our bodies use a gyro-like mechanism in our ears which has 3 mutually orthogonal inertial measurement devices.  Modern motion processors use something called an Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU).  These devices provide movement data which can be used to compensate for the movement.  Chickens apparently have the same type mechanism only with a higher update rate.\n\n*Update* The chickens were eaten by the family dog.  WHOOPS!  :(\n\n*Update #2* Sis and I are shot a music video.

Unsere K\u00f6rper benutzen ein gyroskopisches Mechanismus das drei gegenseitige senkrechte biomechanische Inertialsensore. Moderne bewegungs Prozessoren benutzen einen sogennanten Inertial Measurement Unit, eine art Inertialsensor. Diese Ger\u00e4te geben Daten an so dass es m\u00f6glich ist die Bewegnung auszugleichen. H\u00fchner haben anscheinend das selbe Biomechanismus aber mit h\u00f6hreren aktualisierungs H\u00e4ufigkeit.\n*Update* Die H\u00fchner wurden bei dem Familienhund gefressen! OOOPS \uf04c\n\n*Update #2* Meine Schwester und Ich haben ein Musikvideo aufgenommen. Wenn es Sie interresiert suchen Sie \"Briley brand new key\"\n\n*Update #3*\nDieses Video wird in Japan auf Fuji-TV Spielen. Ha Ha. Wer h\u00e4tte es gedacht?\n\n*Update #4* July 10th, 2009 Eine Million hits! Geil!\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.  Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please share the video.

      "description": "Same as the chicken's ability... only with a small bird I accidently injured    :(\r\n\r\nBirds have a great ability to keep their heads stable. Our bodies use a gyro-like mechanism in our ears which has 3 mutually orthogonal inertial measurement devices. Modern motion processors use something called an Inertial Measurment Unit (IMU). These devices provide movement data which can be used to compensate for the movement.\r\n\r\n*Update* \r\n\r\nI called a licensed wildlife rehabilitator who said birds with broken wings have a very small chance for survival.  After the first day, it looked like he was getting healthier.  Unfortunately he died shortly after.   :(",

      "description": "http://twitter.com/#!/SmarterYoutube\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions\r\n\r\nMy sister covers \"Brand New key\" by Melanie Safka (from the 70s).  \r\n\r\nAll Music (guitar x 2, djembe, eggs, shotgun, vocals) was created by Briley in seperate video tracks then edited together.  My favorite part is the bicycle \"all around the world\" scene in the background.  It's a combination of stopmotion and green screen chroma keying.\r\n\r\nThe video was created with the use of a home-made green screen in my garage,  Stop Motion software called i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, Garage Band, an Ipod and a talented Sister.  \r\n\r\nShe plays Acoustic Guitar, Djembe, percussion eggs, and a Mossberg Shotgun.  \r\n\r\nMeine Schwester spielt eine Coverversion des Liedes \"Brand New Key\" von Melanie Safka (aus den 70er Jahren).\r\n\r\nDie gesamte Musik (2x Gitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier, Schrotflinte und Gesang) wurde von Briley in einzelnen Videos gespielt und dann zusammen geschnitten. Meine Lieblingsstelle ist die \"Mit-Fahrrad-durch-die-ganze-Welt\"-Szene im Hintergrund. Das ist eine Kombination von Stop-Motion- und Green-Screen-Aufnahmen im Chromakey-Verfahren.\r\n\r\nDas Video wurde erstellt mit der Benutzung eines selbstgebauten Green-Screens in meiner Garage, einer Stop-Motion-Software namens i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express, einer Garagenband, einem Ipod und einer talentierten Schwester.\r\n\r\nSie spielt Akustikgitarre, Djembe, Perkussioneier und eine Mossberg Schrotflinte.\r\n\r\nMa soeur reprend \"Brand New Key\" de Melanie Safka (des ann\u00e9es 70).\r\n\r\nToute la partie musicale (guitare x2, djembe, oeufs, fusil, chant) a \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9e par Briley sur des pistes vid\u00e9o distinctes ensuite assembl\u00e9es au montage. Mon passage favori est la sc\u00e8ne de la bicylette \"partout dans le monde\" en arri\u00e8re-plan. C'est une combinaison entre techniques de stop-motion et de chroma key fond vert.\r\n\r\nCette vid\u00e9o a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9alis\u00e9e gr\u00e2ce \u00e0 une toile verte maison tir\u00e9e dans mon garage, aux logiciels i-StopMotion, Final Cut Express et Garage Band, un Ipod ainsi qu'\u00e0 une soeur talentueuse.\r\n\r\nElle joue avec une guitare acoustique, un djembe, des oeufs percussion et un fusil Mossberg.\r\n\r\nFrench Translation courtesy of: PiPoCoeur \r\n\r\nLooking for translations of this description in all languages.\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

      "description": "Rainwater Observatory is a world class observatory located in the small town of French Camp, MS.  When I visited there I was shocked to find out they didn't have any type of promotional videos on the internet.  They believe science supports faith, just as I do.  The directors were kind enough to stay late and allow me to create a shoot this footage so I could make a short film for them.   There's lots of time lapse footage, as well as images taken from their Sangre telescope.  Call them to set up a tour!  We looked at the moon when I was there.\r\n\r\nIn my experience Faith supports science, and vice versa.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.rainwaterobservatory.org/\r\n\r\n\"The Heavens Declare the Glory of God\".\r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

The pain-o-meter is a real-time reflection of the pain signal sent through the nerves in my legs.  It was measured through the insertion of a small needle probe hooked up to a galvanometer.  No, I'm not serious.\r\n2. The anesthesia didn't 'take' on the right toe because it was so infected.  Lack of bloodflow prevented the good stuff from getting to where it needed to go.\r\n3.

      "description": "Some of my happiest moments....\r\n\r\nI was going through some old files and found this old video I made of a mission trip I took to Peru.  The children were wonderful and very happy to have someone loving on them.  Love knows no language barriers.  My intent was simple, to show Love to others and tell them that they are free to read the Bible for themselves and interpret its message on their own.\r\n\r\nI loved and was loved.  The words of Jesus were lived out.  Feel free to ask any questions.\r\n\r\nI realize the video and editing quality is very low.  This was from back in the old days before I learned a thing or two about editing.  The irony is that this video will receive the lowest number of hits on my channel, but it's certainly the most important.  Whether you trust in Jesus or not, hopefully you can agree with me that Loving and serving others is a beautiful thing.  When we get over ourselves and live for others, only then will we truly live.\r\n\r\nThe song is \"Hands and Feet\" by Audio Adrenaline.  \r\n\r\nPennywhistle Productions",

I've also posted another video which investigates the \"Backdriven reflex\" in more depth.  It can be viewed here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvPhBJpCeGg\n\nPeople are often worried about how tight the binder was on the chicken's head.  You'll note I said \"without hurting the chicken\".  I stretched the binder out so it had a very light clamping force.  \n\nAlso, this video inspired another user, Jeremiahjw to create his own chicken powered steadicam.  His video can be seen here:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adlgpovEv7g&feature=email\n\nPennywhistle Productions.\n\n\nIf you enjoy Smarter Every Day and would like to help me come one step closer to sending the kids to college click here: http://bit.ly/MicroScholarship4MyKids\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:",

      "description": "Aliasing occurs when your measurement frequency is not fast enough to accurately capture the measured event.  In general, you want your measurement device to be one order of magnitude faster than the event being measured.\r\n\r\nFrom Wikipedia: accessed January 9th 2011\r\n\"In signal processing and related disciplines, aliasing refers to an effect that causes different signals to become indistinguishable (or aliases of one another) when sampled. It also refers to the distortion or artifact that results when the signal reconstructed from samples is different from the original continuous signal.\"",

In actuality, what they've witnessed is a type of explosion called a \"Deflagration\". Many things are deflagrations.  Logs burning in a fireplace are Deflagrating.  The primer inside the shotgun is actually detonating.  Lead Styphenate or Mercury Fulmanide are used in cartridge primers to start the pyrotechnic train in a bullet/shell.  The primer itself is detonating, which kicks off the gunpowder which burns in the shell.  Any powder detonations occur in the chamber.  As the powder burns and begins to push the projectile out (gas seals with the barrel with something called an \"obteration seal\").  The powder in the barrel is also deflagrating.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

      "description": "I thought I would upload some footage to let you know what it was like just after the Tornado hit.  We called it the \"zombie apocalypse\".  I had many very very interesting experiences during this time.  All of the 3 cities I have lived in over the last 10 years were affected in a major way.  My immediate and extended family were spared, experiencing only inconvenience.  The question is often asked, \"why would a good God allow such things to happen?\"  As a Christian, the honest answer is \"I don't know\".  I can however, report on how it changed us.  We met and became very close to very many people we otherwise wouldn't have known.  We were knocked off our high horse and forced to accept the generosity of others in thankful humility.  I feel like this disaster has made me, personally a different person, (and one might argue for the better).  \r\n\r\nTo say \"God didn't allow this\" is a cop-out.  He's either all knowing and all powerful, or he isn't.  I happen to personally believe he is both, and every life affected was changed in a very specific way.  I, like many others, began to focus on things other than myself and my own personal desires.  I began to try more earnestly to understand Jesus's teachings about how I'm to interact with others.\r\n\r\nWe feel really blessed to still have Briley after this.  Feel free to ask me any questions.  This is probably the only video about the tornado that I'll describe my beliefs on.  You will now return to your normally scheduled \"Smarter Every Day\".\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

      "description": "Post to FB: http://on.fb.me/H2OGuns \n\nCome on, we've all wondered this.  There's been dozens of videos and discussions on the internet about it, but what actually happens?\n\nI'm shooting with a high speed camera made by Vision Research.  \nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/Contact-Us/Contact-Form/  -  Click here and tell them Destin sent you!  That will be fun.\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/  -  Click for high speed video awesomeness\n\nAWESOME MUSIC INFO:\n\"Rep By Pop\" Written and recorded by James Cleary and A Shell in the Pit with bass by Neil Towers.   You can get the song here:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/02-rep-by-pop\n\nSeveral before/after experiments have been performed, but they all have one flaw. It's extremely difficult to visualize what is going on with the flow-fields of the weapon blasts during the time of firing.\n\nWe planned and assembled several different assets including a high speed camera over a few months and then ran a test designed specifically to allow the viewer to observe the gas dynamics in great detail!\n\nNeedless to say, this was a blast.  Well, two blasts if you want to be technical about it (and we usually do).\n\n\nI performed an experiment to see what the differences were between semi-automatic pistols and revolvers.  The advantage of shooting under water is that you can see the boundary of the gas flow fields almost perfectly.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

I mailed them months in advance LEGALLY. They were in a book because the Gambian postal workers have a nasty habit of stealing things they want. Books are pretty good camouflage! \ufeff\n\nWe couldn't motivate kids to come out and watch, so we shot the first rocket for a small group of kids.  After hearing the rocket and all their friends screaming and laughing they came running.  The principal then instructed me to give an impromptu lesson on what rockets are, and why they are used to the whole school.  While I gave the lesson, Stevo taught all the teachers how to reload and fire the rockets.  In all, we did three shots and left the materials with the teachers for another day.  The science teacher in particular was so excited he couldn't stop thanking us.  He said getting the kids motivated about science education was difficult for him because of how many real world hardships the kids had.  The Rockets being launched at the school was the talk of the town for several days.  Kids who didn't show up to school that day were sad they had skipped.  Many more showed up after that, which was part of the goal.... to get people excited about education in general.\n\nHere is another video of someone else teaching well recieved STEM materials in The Gambia.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwsHbbTOpwA\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

      "description": "Chris Fussell was stopped by police in Baltimore for taking photos of a train, a major hobby of his.  Chris wasn't like most of us.  He had taken time to educate himself on the law and his rights.  Its not a good idea to ever contradict a police officer unless you're 100% sure it's safe, and the officer is acting illegally.  Chris's incident seems quite the opposite of an interaction I had with the police in Tuscaloosa immediately after the Tornadoes.  The police force in Tuscaloosa went out of their way to make the public aware of their rights, and how to feel comfortable at night without any power. \n\nWe're not gun crazy people down here in Alabama.  We view guns as a tool, much like a camera or a vehicle.  These particular police men had run a suspected looter off from my sister's house the night before.  This is a great example of a government of \"we the people\" working for the people.  As much heat as policemen get these days on the internet, I thought it would be a great idea to give credit to these fine men serving us in harms way every day. \n\nThe Saiga 12 is a little difficult to load with the bolt forward.  Here, an officer shows me the right way to do it before going back out on patrol.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

Please consider sharing by clicking here: http://bit.ly/FLIPPIN_CATS  GiGi was not hurt during the making of this video.  We took great care to make sure she would be safe. Next I'll explain how the physics involved in flipping cats allow us to operate Space Telescopes (Seriously).\nSo as simple of a question as this is, it turns out to be a MAJOR POINT OF STUDY in Physics, Robotics, Space Satellite Control, Weapons Development, Biomedical Engineering, etc.  It's stumped scientists and engineers since Newton's day.  Here's something interesting.  The cat isn't twisting his back.. he's actually BENDING it.  The next video will go into great detail about what's going on there, and explain how it relates to studying the farthest points in the universe (Seriously... the fact that a cat can do this allows us to study the Universe.. no exaggeration).\n\nThe high speed camera used was a Phantom Miro M320S.

It was amazing.  \nPlease Click to Tweet! http://bit.ly/MACAWesomeSLOWMO \nI apologize for the video being a couple of minutes longer... but it took months of planning and preparation to do this.  I wanted to leave a bit in there about the boat so I wouldn't lose the memories! The noise was awful though (Macaws have a horrible song).\n\nI didn't know most of the rain in the Amazon comes from the Atlantic!\nSo this is what happens when you combine a battery operated Miro LC320S high speed camera with an incredibly specific spot of dirt that Macaws LOVE.  It took several days and lots of modes of transportation to get there, but  we took a new MIRO (http://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/Phantom-Miro-M320S/) to one of the most remote research facilities in the Peruvian Rainforest.  The footage we obtained was incredible.  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION: \n\nHow to get there yourself!:\nI coordinated the travel with Rainforest Expeditions \nhttp://www.perunature.com/\nTell them Destin sent you.\nYou can checkout what they do on their Facebook page: www.facebook.com/Rainforest.Expeditions\nThey ran me up and down the river in a boat, gave me lenses, a clean bed, awesome food etc.  It was pretty amazing!\nSee the research project's website here:\nhttp://macawproject.org/index.php\n\nThe project is led by Dr. Don Brightsmith\nSchubot Exotic Bird Health Center\nDepartment of Veterinary Pathobiology\nCollege of Veterinary Medicine\n\nJeff Cremer was my hook-up for all things photography once I got on site.  He's very good at technical photography and is more than capable of handling anything you can throw at him.

(Click \"Show More\"!)\nPlease help me justify putting this much time and effort into a video by clicking \"LIKE\" and SHARING this as much as possible. Click the following: Tweet: http://bit.ly/TweetRupert    Facebook: http://bit.ly/PrinceRupert  Please share with any science blogs or outlets you think would enjoy it.  \n\nVideos like this don't just happen.  They require lots of time, and lots of favors from very smart and kind people willing to help me and you learn.  PLEASE take a moment and read the following information and support those who supported me.\n\nThis is the camera we used for the ultra-high speed shots.  It has the \"FAST\" option.\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/v16102/\n\nYou absolutely have to check out the stuff Cal Makes.  We're just goofing off in this video, but the guy is some type of glass wizard genius.  It would make me happy if you bought something from him and he felt like the audience appreciated all the time he donated to this video. He basically gave me 2 entire nights of his entire shop.\nhttp://orbixhotglass.com/\nI feel like we're friends at this point, and he is open to the idea of doing more videos in the future and teach me more about what he knows about glass.  Let's make it worth his time.\n\nI'm a HUGE FAN of the song Gordon wrote for this video.  His landlord would really appreciated if you downloaded it so he could make rent this month.\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/manta\nIt looks like he's assembling a new album that I may like more than Mammals:\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/album/hydrophile-in-progress\nShow him some love.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThis video involved about 2 months of research, and me reaching out to several individuals.  I would like to thank everyone who took time out of their schedule to contribute to my wacky research.  A big thanks to the following people:\nMy wife and kids.  I'm sorry this took so long and I wasn't the kind of active father I want to be during the 5 weeks it took to make this.\nDr. Martyn Poliakoff for getting me access to documents which details experiments on the Prince Rupert's Drop by the Royal Society \nhttp://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/41/1/1.full.pdf+html  (behind a pay wall)\n\nBeing able to calculate the failure front velocity of a Prince Rupert's drop is a pretty big deal.  For years this was a scientific mystery.  High speed camera technology is only recently fast enough to provide data like this.  Thanks to Vision Research for letting me use the V1610 to try to unravel this mystery for the public in general. \n\nRob Kuefner for reaching out to me and offering to convert certain equations into LaTeX format for me.\n\nDr. Jeff Evans from UAH.  A friend and neighbor who just happens to have a PhD and be an expert in fracture mechanics. http://bit.ly/YLezDA Thank you for helping me by pointing me in the right direction in the early stages of my research.  It's time we hangout again.\n\nBrian: thanks for letting me use your green screen and telling me about Orbix in the first place.  I stayed up there til about 1 or 2 am two nights in a row acting stupid in front of of the camera all alone.  Now that I look back at that footage without the context of this video, it's all very strange.\n\nThanks to Lo\u00efc Samuel for taking time to make the custom TNT Degradation graphic!\n\nP.S. There was some old guy walking around the track at the park when I was filming me jumping on the bridge railing.  I'm pretty sure you kept walking until I was done just to make sure you wouldn't have to take me to the hospital if I broke my leg.  I'll never meet you again, but I'm grateful for this kind gesture you didn't know I noticed.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

His content is very intelligent and he consistently puts out clever, unique, and interesting content so I decided to contact him and see if he was willing meet up.  I'd love to see him be successful.\n\nAll slow motion sound design and Audio Engineering was done by Gordon McGladdery of \"A Shell In the Pit\".  He designed all the slow motion lip warble sounds from scratch.  http://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/  \n\nI shot Flula's lips at 1,500 Frames per second with a Phantom MIRO LC320S made by Vision Research:\nhttp://www.visionresearch.com/Products/High-Speed-Cameras/Phantom-Miro-M320S\n\nThe sine wave and square wave graphic was designed by Will Leahy\nHe has a website, but there's nothing there: http://www.willleahy.info/  He's working on it.\n\nThe technical sound data was fact checked by:  I said some things wrong initially.  I confused \"Additive Synthesis\" and Filtering.  Gordon McGladdery and these guys got me back on track.  \nGary Bourgeois http://www.chromaxen.com/garymc/\nTimothy McGuinness - http://www.timothymcguinness.com/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\"Timbre\" is basically the wastebasket that Audio Engineers throw all the stuff that they don't really know how to categorize into anything else.  It's the \"color\" of the sound.  Take a minute and read about it:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre\n\nSpectrograms are created by a math operation known as a Fourier Transform. If you don't know what a FFT is, you really should.  Read a bit about shifting stuff from the time to the frequency domain.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

The possibility exists that I put the support positions too close together, which would make the values lower.  The players however gave us the sticks because they were \"so used they were now flimsy\".  Our data reflected this.  If I had it to do over again I would test a new stick vs an old stick.  Kettering University has done some research on this subject and we tried to setup our test apparatus similar to theirs.  They applied the force to the foot of the stick.

      "description": "My beautiful wife is forever patient with me.  Ask her the results: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride \nTweet\u2192http://bit.ly/CologneTwT   Post to FB\u2192http://bit.ly/CologneFB\nhttp://www.harrys.com Promo Code: \"SMARTER\"\n\u21ca\u21ca Click below for more info \u21ca\u21ca\n\nIf you'd like to ask my wife what she thought about this experiment feel free to tweet her: https://twitter.com/DestinsBride\n\nIf you did what I do, there's a cool way you can make it easier for me to do it:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWill Leahy compiled all the data.\nhttp://willleahy.info\nIf you want to play with the graph, it's here!\nhttp://willleahy.info/SEDcologne/\n\nOutro music by A Shell in the Pit\n\"Bottles\" which can be downloaded here.\nhttps://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/track/minke-bottles\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nMETHODOLOGY:\n\nMy first attempts with a new cologne would be to just apply it and wait for a comment.  We have busy lives so often she wouldn't say anything.  If one reached out and grabbed her attention (I try to apply only enough for her to smell me when she's close... not like a high school boy who pours it on) I knew it was an interesting scent to her.  I tried to be honest, so many times I would wear one an entire day without a single comment from her.  That was pretty hard to do because I was hungry for data.  Sometimes if the mood was right and we were getting ready or something I'd casually ask what she thought about a certain fragrance.  She's conducted serious biological research projects before so she understood all along the importance of the data set.\n\nSome colognes I only tried once because it was obvious one of us hated it.  Others were kind of in the \"whatever\" region.  Those I would often try multiple times.  Some she really liked one day, but not another.  Those took multiple tries to weed out.  \n\nOften I would go without wearing anything, or perhaps my old aftershave just to make sure she wasn't gaming the system.  The first or second day or so I realized that if she knew the names of the colognes it DRASTICALLY influenced her opinions.  That just goes to show you how powerful marketing is on our perceptions. \n\nAt some points she got confused because she couldn't tell if I was re-wearing something I had tried earlier.  For example, she became a bit self conscious about whether or not she had already told me she liked one...   I could tell she was trying to give me consistent answers, but I kept shifting it up so much I filtered out all her attempts to game the data.  \n\nI also noticed that if I wore one that she complimented or mentioned without being prompted.\n\nIn the end, I'm really happy with what we chose.

I should note, that Byron doesn't call himself the \"Best\" archer, or the \"Most Amazing\" archer or anything like that.  These are my words, because to me, he really is the most amazing archer.\nHe's a cool dude with the right balance of humility and confidence, and I have an incredible amount of respect for him as a person.  I'm under no obligation to recommend that you hire him for your live event... but I do.  Book him through his wife Wanda here under \"Exhibition Shooting\".\nhttp://www.byronferguson.com/\n\nMusic is \"Empousai\" by A Shell In The Pit.  Download it here:\nhttps://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/album/smarter-every-day-vol-ii\n\nA huge thank you to Alexander for shooting his compound bow for the high speed, as well as helping me rig up the Harry's Razor pop up target.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nhttp://www.smartereveryday.com\nMy Instagram account: http://instagram.com/smartereveryday\nPatreon Support Link: http://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/smartereveryday\nwww.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\nCircle Packing:\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_packing\n\nCircle Packing Calculator:\nhttp://www.packomania.com/\n\nhttp://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/smaller-circles-in-larger-circle-d_1849.html\n\nNote: I realize that circle packing isn't a perfect way to quantify this.  It was a new geometric concept to me that I had never used and really liked the idea of exploring it.  It doesn't take into account an edge hit or grazing shot, for example... but all in all I feel like it's a great way to get a quick feel for the difficulty of hitting a target.\n\nThank you to Matthew Feickert who coded the equation in LaTeX for the video.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

I wasn't \"ACTIVELY\" trying to learn.  Meaning... I wasn't struggling and trying to make my brain learn.  I simply got on the bike every day, tried to operate it to the end of the driveway, turned around and tried to operate it back.  The goal was to understand how my brain figured things out on its own, without trying to force it to.  Many people have built bikes like this and figured it out in much less than 1 day by staying on the bike until they were able to master it.  I had no timelines, and was using this as an exploratory activity to learn how I learn.\n\nDo not misinterpret this to mean that I struggled and tried very hard every day for 8 months.  That's simply not true.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

We used two songs from other artists (licensed of course). Derek split the first one up so it fades from video to video, and Gordon split the instruments up on the second one.  There are violins on one video and percussion on the other for example.  It's really neat.\n\nThe neat earth animation at the beginning and the synchronizing timer was made by http://eisenfeuer.com/. He also made still images of the earth from the top and the bottom.\n\nThanks to Jacob Vehrs for helping make the plywood pool platform.\n\nGET SMARTER SECTION:\n\nThere was a study performed at MIT years ago (http://web.mit.edu/hml/ncfmf/09VOR.pdf) that explained the physics involved.  We repeated some of these demonstrations, but on opposite sides of the globe\u2026and in a way that can be easily understood.\nThis site is a great resource on the Coriolis effect and ways people have gotten it wrong:\nhttp://www.ems.psu.edu/~fraser/Bad/BadCoriolis.html\n\nThe Coriolis Effect influences the flight of a bullet.\nhttp://www-das.uwyo.edu/~geerts/cwx/notes/chap11/artillery.html\n\nWe would love for someone to replicate this demonstration.  Please tweet your results to us @SmarterEveryDay and @Veritasium.\nHere's the link to puchase the exact same pool:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Intex-56451NP-Inflatable-Snapset-Pool/dp/B000OV0X34/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1433743067&sr=1-1&keywords=5%27+kiddie+pool\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for the kids' education. Until then if you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please SHARE THE VIDEO!\n\nIf you REALLY liked it, feel free to pitch a few dollars towards their college fund by clicking here:\nhttp://bit.ly/KidsCollege\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nDestin",

Animating anything for 10 minutes is a big deal so instead of trial and error, he put what he knew about the rules of perspective and made this grid system to line things up, all to make the dots on that map in the corner work like you'd expect them to.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTweet ideas to me @SmarterEveryDay\n\nInstead of saving for my kids' college, I make videos using the money I would have saved.\nThe thought is it will help educate the world as a whole, and one day generate enough revenue to pay for their education.

Why haven't we figured this out before?  Whenever I go to Africa and South America I always make sure to pack a ridiculous amount of batteries.  People always ask me for them because batteries which you purchase in country are horrible.  This blending of an ancient technology with a new technology is a game changer, and as a mechanical engineer, I find it to be super exciting.  \n\nFor those wondering, the units are just under $10, so the payback for a family in a developing nation should end up being about 3 months.  This effectively eliminates the kerosene lighting poverty trap that millions of people fall into.  I absolutely love it when engineering innovation solves an economic and environmental issue.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nIf you appreciate what you've learned in this video and the effort that went in to it, please SHARE THE VIDEO!\n\nIf you REALLY liked it, feel free to pitch in via Patreon:\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nDestin\n\n\nPsalm 111:2",

A major mission of Hudson Alpha is to educate the public and promote genomics literacy.  I talked to many scientists about Genotyping but Dr. Lamb's ability to break down the complexity of the human genome is what finally brought it home for me.  Hudson Alpha provides many opportunities for Genomics Education and \n Hudson Alpha is http://hudsonalpha.org/ for explaining the difference between Genotyping and Sequencing.  To contact a super smart Genomics Professional at Hudson Alpha click here: hudsonalpha.org/contact \n\nGenotyping and Sequencing are very different:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genotyping\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequencing#DNA_sequencing\n\nThe 23andMe Genotyping service is provided by LabCorp\nAccording to their website, LabCorp is \"The World's Leading Health Care Diagnostics Company\"\nhttps://www.labcorp.com/\n\nNo Private or Health Information about any individual was recorded or shared in the making of this video (This video is HIPAA compliant).\n\nA special thanks to the Lab Manager Amanda Douglas for being a complete science rock star and a great person to work with  I spoke with about a dozen LabCorp Employees who are under Amanda and every one said she was an absolute joy to work for.  I know my experience working with her great and I hope her boss reads this blurb I wrote down here in the video description and gives her a high five and a big fat bonus or something equally as awesome.\n\n23andMe provide Genotyping testing using an Illumina HumanOmniExpress-24 format chip.  Here's a bit about the chip.  Heads up, it's incredible technology. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVG04dAAyvY\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

I think the most important technical issue to overcome is timing.  Much like how your brain can understand hearing someone's voice AFTER seeing their lips move, but not the opposite... the lag time of the sense of touch is an important thing for your brain.  Another thing I hand't considered is the \"rise time\" that has to do with internal stresses in your fingers.  If you conceptualize your fingers as water balloons around bones, you can understand how the internal pressure of your fingers rise the harder you press something.  This type of information coupled with the \"Sensory Homunculus\" make for some incredibly fulfilling thought experiments.  \n\nThe temperature question is something I'm particularly interested in.  Using a colder fluid to model a room temperature fluid because of the heat transfer equation is a fascinating area of scientific problem solving.  If you think it through, everything about this boils down to differential equations.  How much heat is leaking out of the hand, and at what rate, through what contact area?\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nSensory / Cortical Homunculus \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_homunculus\n\nTwo Point Threshold\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-point_discrimination\n\nI asked HaptX for a blurb to explain their company.

Ultimately I decided it was ok to live with dye dripping out of the front.\n\nWe had to premix the dyes and eventually we got there.\n\nIt got to the point where we didn\u2019t even really know what success looked like and always thought we were there.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like to use.

A pipe is calculated different than an airplane wing etc.\nSome fluid dynamicists would tell you that it's an exact science. I personally feel that it's a bit subjective. \nThe most difficult parameter to nail down in my humble opinion is the characteristic length.\nIt's pretty easy for pipes, you just measure the diameter... but wings, plates, vortices...get complicated quickly.\n\nYou'll notice in the video I refrained from saying anything like \n\"Flow is laminar when Reynolds number is less than XXX\" or \n\"Flow is turbulent when Reynolds number is more than XXX\".\nThere are different schools of thought on this.  Typically the transition between laminar flow and turbulent flow occurs somewhere between 2100 and 4000 (Reynolds number is unitless).\n\nLaminar Flow:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow\n\nReynolds Number:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reynolds_number\n\nOsborne Reynolds\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Reynolds\n\nFeeling froggy?

I'm taking a break to go back to school, but here's a peek into the part of my life I've kept hidden from the internet for many years. I was asked if I wanted to film my last mission and use it as an opportunity to explain \"Multi-Domain Operations\" to the public.  After much consideration, I decided that this topic (especially the cyber-domain issue) was important and chose to help inform the public.\n\nMy mission was to participate in a missile and torpedo engagement exercise at Pacific Missile Range Facility as part of RIMPAC 2018.  RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific Exercise) is the largest naval exercise in the world.  It's used to test interoperability and the ability to work as an international force.\n \nClick here if you're interested in subscribing: http://bit.ly/Subscribe2SED \u21ca  Click below for more links!  \u21ca\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nI was invited to discuss multi-domain operations with General Brown: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Brooks_Brown\n\nExercise RIMPAC \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exercise_RIMPAC\n\nWhere we performed the exercise\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Missile_Range_Facility\n\nWe fired the Norwegian Naval Strike Missile\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Strike_Missile\n\nJGSDF Fires Surface-to-Ship Missile during RIMPAC SINKEX \nhttps://www.dvidshub.net/image/4557687/jgsdf-fires-surface-ship-missile-during-rimpac-sinkex\n\nFor the last 15 years I have worked for the Army Test Evaluation Command.

I now  sometimes think about the outline of physical objects as if it's a line.  The specific area of math that you use for things like this is called \"Parametric Equations\".  I had a lot of great conversations about this stuff with Hansi and Jerobeam.  I was very impressed by their intelligence, and also very thankful that they took their time to share these special things with me.  I know they'd really appreciate it if you'd reach out to their website and purchase OsciStudio as well as some of Jerobeam's music.  Even if you don't have an oscilloscope, purchasing the software will obviously help them continue to do what they love doing.  Hansi showed me a very interesting thing he's working on involving ray tracing.  It was fascinating.  \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nSUPPORT THE ARTISTS!\n\nHere's the website you want to go to:\nhttps://oscilloscopemusic.com/\n\nDirect Links:\n\nDownload OsciStudio Here so you can draw 3D objects in Blender \nhttps://oscilloscopemusic.com/oscistudio.php\n\nDownload some Oscilloscope Music here: \nhttps://oscilloscopemusic.com/watch.php#album\n\nCheck out Jerobeam's channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/jerobeamfenderson1/\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nMath is the secret to all of this.

We made ours in 2018, and Chad visited my house in January 2019 to film most of this.  We didn't post it for various reasons, but decided now might be a good time.  The fidelity of the inference is a function of how you train it.... so obviously the more data points you provide, the better it will perform.  This particular type of machine learning is known as object detection, with the computation being performed by a deep neural network \"on the edge\".  The video stream is processed locally and no internet is needed to find the object in real time.

I even visited the Air Force Research Lab at Wright Patterson AFB to discuss some aspects of this video with Aerodynamicists.  Synchronizing all this footage and coordinating additional B Roll with the Thunderbirds Public Affairs Officer also required a lot of effort.  \n\nThese are my own thoughts, not those of the U.S. Air Force or the Thunderbirds:\nI've been around a lot of pilots and ground crew in my life and I must say that the professionalism displayed by the Thunderbirds was astounding.  Their goal is to inspire and demonstrate the capabilities of the US Air Force, so I'll take it a step further.  If you're a smart young person who is interesting in changing your life for the better, strongly consider the Air Force.  The job market isn't the best at the moment but the Air Force still has opportunities available for you to learn incredible skills even if you're not interested in flying.  They manage everything from logistics, electronics, aerospace, cyber and even space systems.  The threats to freedom are becoming more complex, and in my experience working for the Department of Defense over a 15 year span (even longer if you count my work as a contractor) The US Air Force consists of some of the most intelligent service members our country has.  These people are book-smart, but also have the confidence to solve real world problems with their own hands.  If I have a complex aerodynamic question, my first call is usually to someone in the Air Force, because they understand these complex phenomena intuitively.  For example, in this video you would hear Flack and I talking about pitot tubes in flight.  We also had other discussions about fuel burn rates, Prandtl Glauert, weather.... all kinds of things.  Simply put, if you're looking for direction in your life, and you're good with science and math... consider the Air Force.  That being said, they also need other types of skills as well.  Logisticians, writers, creative people who know how to solve complex problems in unique ways.  \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Dynamics_F-16_Fighting_Falcon\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prandtl%E2%80%93Glauert_transformation\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

I wish I knew about this when I was younger.  https://www.gi.alaska.edu/\n\nCheck out the University of Alaska Fairbanks.\nhttps://uaf.edu/uaf/\n\nThe US Navy has several options such as engineer, pilot, submariner, logistics, accountant, medical doctor, and even Public Affairs specialist. I continue to be impressed by people that I meed who spent time in the Navy.  I worked with various people during the course of filming this video and they were all top notch.  https://www.navy.com/\n\nI asked Sofia to write a little blurb about her job experience: Sofia Montalvo is an Ice Analyst at the US National Ice Center (USNIC). She studied meteorology at the University of Miami and atmospheric science at North Carolina State University, but did not know that mapping and forecasting sea ice for safety and navigation was a thing she could do. She loves her job for the mission it upholds:  The USNIC Operations Department Analysts use remote sensing and model data to produce hemispheric, regional, and tailored ice and snow analyses. The Operations department is committed to the safety of navigation, protection of life and property, and government scientific research.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n\n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.

A super big thanks to David Linderman, Jeremy Fielding, Trent, and David Woodall (the welder).\n\nI realize most people who support Smarter Every Day don't do it for \"transactional\" reasons, (ie, I'll support Smarter Every Day to get stuff).  I also realized that there is often a mental hurdle that must be crossed before support on Patreon starts.  My thought is that I'd really like to give folks a baseball, and it might provide enough momentum to get over that initial hurdle.  I signed the first shipment of baseballs I received, but I only have so many of those.  There's no implication that my signature is worth anything.... it's just kind of what you do with baseballs... it's a tradition.  After a certain number, it will transition to unsigned baseballs.  I've got enough signed baseballs to over all existing Patrons, and many more, but I will wait a month or so to see how many I need to get, then I'll order the second batch.  I like to support jobs and pay people for what they're good at.  The machinists and welders who made the parts in this video for example.  The whole intent here is to diversify away from solely being ad sponsored so I don't have to answer to anyone but myself and Patrons with respect to the types of content I choose to make.  Thank you for understanding what I'm doing here, and even if you decide not to kick in at https://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday , I'm super grateful you took the time to watch this video!  \nThank you very much, \n\nDestin\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET SMARTER SECTION\n\nWhen I was younger, my favorite baseball players were Cal Ripken Jr. and Nolan Ryan https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Ryan\n\nNolan Ryan's fastball has been beat, but when adjusted for radar gun placement it may still be the fastest pitch ever: \nhttps://www.si.com/extra-mustard/2015/04/22/fastball-pitching-documentary-mlb\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nJeremy Fielding's YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_SLthyNX_ivd-dmsFgmJVg\n\nTweet Ideas to me at:\nhttp://twitter.com/smartereveryday\n\nSmarter Every Day on Facebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/SmarterEveryDay\n\nSmarter Every Day on Patreon\nhttps://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nSmarter Every Day On Instagram\nhttps://www.instagram.com/smartereveryday\n\nSmarter Every Day SubReddit\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/smartereveryday\n\nAmbiance, audio and musicy things by: Gordon McGladdery \nhttps://www.ashellinthepit.com/\nhttp://ashellinthepit.bandcamp.com/\n\nIf you feel like this video was worth your time and added value to your life, please SHARE THE VIDEO!\n\nIf you REALLY liked it, feel free to pitch a few dollars Smarter Every Day by becoming a Patron.\nhttp://www.patreon.com/smartereveryday\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nDestin",

Other than making sure my footage was cleared for Operational Security, I am free to say whatever I want about this experience.\n\nAnother note: The Navy did not ask me to provide a link to their website (or do anything for that matter), but I\u2019m going to provide a link because I want smart people to become submariners. The US Navy continues to provide stability and security in ways no other organization on earth does.

I continue to be impressed by people that I meet who spent time in the Navy.  I worked with various people during the course of filming this video and they were all top notch.  https://www.navy.com/\n\nFire onboard a submarine is a big deal:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dl1yB4KXMV4\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nGET STUFF SECTION: \n\n(If I did this right these should be working Amazon affiliate links to purchase the stuff I like  to use.
