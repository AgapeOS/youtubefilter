      "description": "Our culture has been proudly touting gender transitioning as a solution, when it\u2019s actually the problem. As medical gender transitions become more common, so too have been regrets for undergoing them. In this video, Bryan Osborne views several clips of trans people expressing their fears and regrets for what they\u2019ve done, and then points us to the only solution: finding our ultimate identity in Christ.\n\nVeryWellHealth. \u201cWhat Is Gender Transitioning?\u201d Last modified June 18, 2022. https://www.verywellhealth.com/gender-transitioning-5085242.\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

Some would say that individuals should have a transition to match their felt reality\u2014at least in their mind\u2014to their physical reality. So they try to seek ways to remedy this. But biblically, we have a different understanding of this issue. Yes, people can feel wrong about things. People can be broken in any number of ways, gender being one of them. But we\u2019re all broken because of sin. And just because we\u2019re broken by sin doesn\u2019t mean we should try to reform our bodies or reality to the sin that we feel.\n\nWatch the full video on the AiG YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK6oR1OWxiE\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

Barnum had featured diseased, deformed, and diminutive individuals in exhibits for years in different venues. In fact, Barnum had the Wild Man of the Prairies described as the deformed but talented man-monkey Harvey Leech as far back as the 1840s.\n\nEvolution has caused many humiliating and saddening events to unfold. In the 1800s and 1900s, evolutionary ideas spurred on the racist and dehumanizing treatment of precious human lives made in the image of God\u2014but evolutionists don\u2019t want you to remember this. In this series, Calvin Smith from Answers in Genesis\u2013Canada looks at past \u201cfreak shows\u201d that advertised and demeaned humans with deformities, often linking them to animals or transitory evolutionary beings.\n\nDon't miss the first season of Freakshow, available on Answers.tv. \n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

      "description": "As evolutionary ideas continued to grow among the scientific and lay communities, missing link exhibits in sideshows became more and more commonplace. Naturalistic ideas of man\u2019s origins were disseminated first among the scientific elite and then among the general public through such exhibits. And once popularized, they were then used by scientists as observable examples of human evolution. And this created an ideological cycle of cross-promotion that bolstered belief in more naturalistic ideas of man\u2019s origins among all strata of society in clear contradiction of the plain reading of God\u2019s Word.\n\nIn this series, Calvin Smith from Answers in Genesis\u2013Canada looks at past \u201cfreak shows\u201d that advertised and demeaned humans with deformities, often linking them to animals or transitory evolutionary beings.\n\nDon\u2019t miss the first season of Freakshow, available on Answers.tv. \n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

This means that, in the span of 600 years from Noah to Joseph, we have gone from two animals on the ark to species that are so distinct from each other that there are separate words for them.\n\nWatch the full video on the Answers in Genesis YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey98tT84PKA&t=788s\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

The conditions produced by the flood eventually ended, and the oceans just cooled off. There was no longer heat being added from below. Without all the heat, less water vapor was added to the atmosphere and less snow was added to the glaciers. Also, with less water, the temperature started to vary a lot more. The winters got colder and the summers got hotter. In both cases, everything got drier. The glaciers started melting back, and a lot of those beautiful green grasslands these animals would graze on started to turn into deserts. And in the north, the grasslands started to become tundra. \n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

Well, there\u2019s only one way to determine the age of the earth, and that\u2019s if someone was there and saw the earth created and revealed to us when it happened. And we have someone, God, who created all things. He tells us he made everything in six days and made Adam on day six. And then we have the genealogies that list when people were born and died. You can count them to Abraham, and then to Jesus, and then to the present. And when you add that up, it comes to about 6,000 years.\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

When you look at the letters in LGBT, the L and the G really cannot coexist with the T. It doesn\u2019t work. There\u2019s no consistency in both the feminist and LGBT worldview. We think of them arising out of a humanistic philosophy, but if there\u2019s no identity that grounds them, then the feminist who wants to exalt women and the LGBT movement who wants to exalt their ideals will have conflict with one another. They will devour themselves and wind up in that chaos.\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

So let\u2019s use decks of playing cards to represent genetic information in a specific kind of creature to help us understand how changes in living things can happen without them evolving. If we start with two decks, shuffling each, and dealing half of the cards from one deck and half from the other deck into a new deck, we would see the new deck we created would be different than the original ones And if you keep doing this, the decks will change every time you deal them. Some decks will look similar to others and some will be very unique. But because there\u2019s a limited amount of cards to start with, they can only vary so much. It\u2019s like the dog kind. You can get a variety of dogs, but they\u2019re all still dogs.\n\nWatch the full video on Answers TV: https://www.Answers.TV\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

      "description": "What do the fossils show? They show evidence of sudden appearance. Creatures are fully formed and complex without any ancestors in the layers beneath them. Let me unpack that for you.\n\nEven a simple cell is complex. You ask any microbiologist who looks down a microscope, and they will tell you that you can fit the cell on the size of a pinpoint\u2014and is incredibly complex. In fact, one biologist said the cell is as complex as a city the size of New York or London because it's got a brain\u2014a control center\u2014or a nucleus, it\u2019s got transport networks, it\u2019s got factories, it\u2019s got powerhouses.\n\nSo how can we go from nothing in the fossils, to the complexity of a cell, to the complexity of creatures like flatworms and trilobites with no links in between? The truth is they did not evolve in the beginning and change into completely new creatures; they were created in the beginning by God. This observable evidence in God\u2019s world totally agrees with what we read in God\u2019s Word.\n\nWant to learn more?
