Secular dinosaur shows push evolutionary ideas like: dinosaurs existed millions of years ago, dinosaurs evolved into birds, and dinosaurs went extinct long before man supposedly evolved. Kids need to hear the truth!\n\nCombining education and humor, Ken Ham and Buddy Davis take kids (and adults!) on an exciting ride through both the 7 C\u2019s of History and the 7 Ages of Dinosaurs. Your children will be shown how to separate the facts from fiction about these amazing creatures and their place in the awesome history of the universe. \n \nDinosaurs were amazing! Evolutionists go out of their way to avoid God\u2019s life-changing revelation, but Ken and Buddy use these \u201cmissionary lizards\u201d to show that the Bible is right about history\u2014and about sin and salvation, too.\n\nWatch our premiere content without ads on Answers.tv\nAnswers in Genesis videos, live streams, and more\u2014all in one place!\nhttps://www.answers.tv/videos/dinosaurs-and-more",

      "description": "We\u2019ve been told that humans evolved from ape-like creatures, and fossils like \u201cLucy\u201d are touted as being \u201cape-men,\u201d or links, in the evolutionary chain. Join Dr. David Menton as he explains the three ways that facts must be twisted in order to call fossil remains an ape-man. Dr. Menton will teach you how to recognize the tell-tale signs that separate an ape from a human. Using your new knowledge of things like differences in facial structure, ulna shape and pelvic alignment, you will then test your ability to distinguish those \u201cape-men\u201d that are really apes from those that are really humans.\n\nFar from being ancestors of humankind, ape-men can only be constructed in one of three ways: by taking a human skull and declaring it to be ape-like (e.g., Neanderthal man); by taking an ape skull and declaring it to be human-like (e.g., Lucy, or Australopithecus afarensis); or by mixing ape and human fossil specimens together (as was done with Piltdown man). After seeing this workshop you will have no doubt that the famous \u201cLucy\u201d fossils belong to a knuckle-walking, ape-like animal, and not a creature that is part ape and part human.\n\nDR. DAVID MENTON holds a PhD from Brown University and served as a professor at Washington University for 34 years. He retired as an associate professor emeritus and now serves with Answers in Genesis.\n\n- - - - - - - - - -\nWatch ad free on Answers.tv\nAnswers in Genesis videos, live streams, and more - all in one place!\nhttps://www.answers.tv/videos/descent-of-man-150-three-ways-to-make-an-ape-man",

Many prominent philanthropists, scientists, and politicians believed that the human race was degrading because the poor, sick, and deformed were cared for and therefore survived to reproduce. Because of their acceptance of molecules-to-man evolution, these cultural leaders believed that mankind would only progress if laws were passed to enforce sterilization and segregation of the \u201cundesirables,\u201d and if immigration and marriage of the same were restricted. Margaret Sanger embraced these ideas, and they were foundational in her establishment of Planned Parenthood.\n\nAlthough the eugenics movement lost momentum when it was associated with the horrors of the Nazi regime, it didn\u2019t die. Instead it became \u201cquiet and careful.\u201d A resurgence of eugenics is brewing. Modern Planned Parenthood still advocates many eugenic ideals. As Christians it is our responsibility to view life from God\u2019s perspective and to defend all of those who are created in His image. No matter how impaired a human life may seem, every person has value because they are made in God\u2019s image to bring glory to Himself.\n\nDR.

How can we engage people with the message of the Gospel, and how can we be ready for their responses?\n\nWe are delighted to bring you six LIVE presentations (and a special Q&A session) featuring six speakers involved in various aspects of evangelism around the world, including special guest Ray Comfort and others.

Don\u2019t be afraid!\n\nPlease join us at this unique conference, exclusively on Answers.TV on Saturday 17th April 2021 from 12 noon to 8 p.m. (All times are BST, London\u2014if you are in a different time zone, please check your equivalent).\n\nRegister now! https://www.answers.tv/products/answers-for-evangelism-webinar",

Therefore a bishop* must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive, for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church? He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.\n- - - - - - - - - - - 1 Timothy 3:1-7 (*episkopos = overseer)\n\nWatch ad free on https://Answers.tv\nAnswers in Genesis videos, live streams, and more\u2014all in one place!\nhttps://www.answers.tv/videos/2021-05-17-does-the-bible-define-bishop \n\n- - - - - - - - - - - \nArticles:\n\n15 French volunteers leave cave after 40 days without daylight or clocks\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/25/deep-time-team-ends-40-days-underground-in-french-cave\n \nEvangelical Lutheran Church of America Elects First Transgender Person as Bishop\nhttps://www.christianheadlines.com/contributors/milton-quintanilla/evangelical-lutheran-church-of-america-elects-first-transgender-person-as-bishop.html\n \nSchool chaplain challenges dismissal over LGBT views\nhttps://www.christiantoday.com/article/school.chaplain.challenges.dismissal.over.lgbt.views/136775.htm\n \n\"Competing ideologies\" by Bernard Randall\nhttps://christianconcern.com/resource/a-school-sermon-by-bernard-randall-competing-ideologies/ \n \nBrain\u2019s movement control centre may have had key role in our evolution\nhttps://newscientist.com/article/2276936-brains-movement-control-centre-may-have-had-key-role-in-our-evolution/\n \nEarly humans lived in this South African Cave 2 million years ago, making it the World\u2019s Oldest home, Archaeologists say\nhttps://news.artnet.com/art-world/wonderwerk-cave-worlds-oldest-home-1961900\n \nCalgary pastor whose Easter confrontation with police went viral arrested after holding church service\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/world/canada-calgary-pastor-arrested-covid-health-order-church-service\n \nDinoflagellate Genome Structure Unlike Any Other Known\nhttps://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/dinoflagellate-genome-structure-unlike-any-other-known-68749\n \nIs there a pattern to the universe?\nhttps://www.livescience.com/is-there-pattern-in-universe.html\n \n- - - - - - - - - - -\nwikipedia commons photo of Rev.

By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.

      "description": "Join Ken Ham and lead designer Allen Greene as they discuss the construction of the expanded,  permanent Fearfully and Wonderfully Made exhibit at the Creation Museum, set to open in 2022.\n \nThe Bible informs us that every human being, from the moment of fertilization, is made in God\u2019s image. This is true regardless of one\u2019s level of development, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, sex, or age. Although issues regarding life in the womb are hotly contested in our world, the matter is settled by the ultimate authority, the very words of our Creator.\n\nThe Fearfully and Wonderfully Made exhibit calls attention to biblical and scientific truths about the unborn while pointing guests to the hope and forgiveness that can only be found in the gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nCome see the new exhibit next year in late 2022! For more information on this exciting, pro-life exhibit, check out the temporary exhibit page on the Creation Museum\u2019s website: https://creationmuseum.org/fearfully-wonderfully-made/\n\nVisit https://Answers.tv: All Answers in Genesis videos, live streaming, and much more\u2014all in one place.\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

In this presentation, we answer several of the most common questions about the star of Bethlehem.\n\nSimon Turpin and Prof Stuart Burgess discuss the star of Bethlehem. \n\n\"Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, \u201cGo and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him.\u201d \nAfter listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was.  When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. \nAnd going into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.\"\nMatthew 2:7-11\n\nhttps://answersingenesis.org/bios/stuart-burgess/ \n\nWatch ad free on https://Answers.tv\nAnswers in Genesis videos, live streams, and more\u2014all in one place!\nhttps://www.answers.tv/videos/2021-talking-turpin-star-of-bethlehem",

      "description": "Gender dysphoria is when individuals feel a particular way that doesn\u2019t line up with their physical reality. Some would say that individuals should have a transition to match their felt reality\u2014at least in their mind\u2014to their physical reality. So they try to seek ways to remedy this. But biblically, we have a different understanding of this issue. Yes, people can feel wrong about things. People can be broken in any number of ways, gender being one of them. But we\u2019re all broken because of sin. And just because we\u2019re broken by sin doesn\u2019t mean we should try to reform our bodies or reality to the sin that we feel.\n\nWatch the full video on the AiG YouTube channel. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qK6oR1OWxiE\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

However, such shows featured many bizarre spectacles, the most grotesque being the sadly misnamed freak shows. Many people involved were exploited\u2014depicted as evolutionary missing links\u2014not created in the image of God. Eventually, concepts of scientific racism\u2014resulting in barbaric ideologies like the eugenics movement and the horrors of the Holocaust and other genocides\u2014emanated from these evolutionary ideas.

      "description": "How quickly did two animals go from two to many different species? Take the horse kind, for example. In Genesis, after the flood, we have the account of Joseph. He was sold into slavery in Egypt, and he one day became the ruler of Egypt, second only to Pharaoh. There was a famine, and the Egyptians needed food. In Genesis 47, we are told that Joseph gave the Egyptians food in exchange for horses, flocks, herds, and donkeys. Both the horses and the donkeys are here, and there are separate words for them. This means that, in the span of 600 years from Noah to Joseph, we have gone from two animals on the ark to species that are so distinct from each other that there are separate words for them.\n\nWatch the full video on the Answers in Genesis YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ey98tT84PKA&t=788s\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

      "description": "Porch pirate crime sprees are rampant these days, where people steal packages off people's porches; it's happened so much that it\u2019s generated a vigilante response. One YouTuber has designed packages that film and prank the thieves when they steal them. And the immediate consequences that happen to these thieves are good, divine reminders that we don\u2019t get away with sin. Indeed, God sees everything. He sees every thought, word, deed, and action\u2014good or bad, and he\u2019ll bring everything into perfect, eternal judgment.\n\nIn the full video, Bryan Osborne reacts to popular \u201cinstant regret\u201d videos and gives us his biblical perspective. We see a package thief receive immediate justice, a comedian faint right after boasting that Jesus loves her the most, and a heretical pastor get his talk cut off by a lightning strike.\n\nWatch the full video on the Answers in Genesis YouTube channel: www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzwSwakZlLs",

      "description": "What happened to ice age giants like the mammoths and mastodons? One factor is that we are no longer living in an ice age. The conditions produced by the flood eventually ended, and the oceans just cooled off. There was no longer heat being added from below. Without all the heat, less water vapor was added to the atmosphere and less snow was added to the glaciers. Also, with less water, the temperature started to vary a lot more. The winters got colder and the summers got hotter. In both cases, everything got drier. The glaciers started melting back, and a lot of those beautiful green grasslands these animals would graze on started to turn into deserts. And in the north, the grasslands started to become tundra. \n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

      "description": "Darwin knew almost nothing of modern genetics and simply assumed that there was virtually no limit to the potential variation among the individuals of a species. Though truthfully, any animal breeder of his day could have told him otherwise, as people have been performing experimental breeding for thousands of years now. Today, Darwin\u2019s far-fetched belief in species slowly evolving into completely different species is called macroevolution. But like all fiction, it\u2019s completely unobservable outside of man-made depictions in textbooks and videos that are used to convince people of something no one has ever seen.\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

How can we have enough resources for all the people on this planet, and how can we do it in a manner that is consistent with biblical revelation? This really all goes back to the biblical principle of stewardship. So what that means is that people are to exercise this God-given mandate to steward well all the resources under heaven.   God has put us here. He made us. He made the world. He made the entire universe. He knows how many people this planet can sustain.

So let\u2019s use decks of playing cards to represent genetic information in a specific kind of creature to help us understand how changes in living things can happen without them evolving. If we start with two decks, shuffling each, and dealing half of the cards from one deck and half from the other deck into a new deck, we would see the new deck we created would be different than the original ones And if you keep doing this, the decks will change every time you deal them. Some decks will look similar to others and some will be very unique. But because there\u2019s a limited amount of cards to start with, they can only vary so much. It\u2019s like the dog kind. You can get a variety of dogs, but they\u2019re all still dogs.\n\nWatch the full video on Answers TV: https://www.Answers.TV\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

That\u2019s the thing we have to remember. They\u2019re actually different symptoms of the one problem. And unless we understand that, we\u2019re not going to be able to help the situation. And what\u2019s the problem? Well, it\u2019s like Judges 21:25, when there was no king, no absolute authority, everyone does what is right in his own eyes. \n\nPeople ask me what has happened to America\u2014it\u2019s very simple. You take generations of kids; you indoctrinate them. You tell them there\u2019s no God, the Bible is not true, there\u2019s no absolute authority except yourself, and you can determine what\u2019s right and wrong. Then ultimately, anything goes. In a culture where anything goes and you\u2019ve got to allow all ideas and beliefs, what doesn\u2019t go is the absolutes of Christianity because they are in conflict.\n\nWatch Ken Ham's full talk here: https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=3W4qxn3Ge6g&t=1550s\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

Death and suffering have just always been around as part of God\u2019s original, very good creation. And if death is not the payment for sin, then Jesus\u2019s death does not and can not pay for our sin debt, and we are all still lost in our sins and bound for hell. We just destroyed the foundation for the gospel, whether we meant to or not, and at best, we\u2019ve made Jesus's death unnecessary.\n\nLearn more: Watch the full video on the Answers in Genesis YouTube channel: https://www.YouTube.com/watch?v=N4wd1n5fi5U&t=1141s\n\nPlease help us continue to share the gospel around the world: https://AnswersinGenesis.org/give",

      "description": "What do the fossils show? They show evidence of sudden appearance. Creatures are fully formed and complex without any ancestors in the layers beneath them. Let me unpack that for you.\n\nEven a simple cell is complex. You ask any microbiologist who looks down a microscope, and they will tell you that you can fit the cell on the size of a pinpoint\u2014and is incredibly complex. In fact, one biologist said the cell is as complex as a city the size of New York or London because it's got a brain\u2014a control center\u2014or a nucleus, it\u2019s got transport networks, it\u2019s got factories, it\u2019s got powerhouses.\n\nSo how can we go from nothing in the fossils, to the complexity of a cell, to the complexity of creatures like flatworms and trilobites with no links in between? The truth is they did not evolve in the beginning and change into completely new creatures; they were created in the beginning by God. This observable evidence in God\u2019s world totally agrees with what we read in God\u2019s Word.\n\nWant to learn more?
