But when we look at the story of the Bible, we'll become fascinated with it too. We'll find it's the most complicated but simple story of all time. God has a great love for us and wants us to know Him. The Bible is the story of how He has made a way for us to have a relationship with Him. It shows us who He is, and it tells us who we are. This series will help kids connect the dots between the stories IN the Bible to see the overarching story OF the Bible. And to help kids experience this flow through history and how God's story unfolded, we'll leave kids with the same cliffhanger God's people faced too, waiting on the Savior God promised.",

When they choose to lie, cheat, steal, or gossip, they are choosing not to reflect God's true nature of honesty. Being honest has lots of great positive consequences that come along with it, but the best reason to choose honesty is because God is honest.",

This Christmas series teaches kids that everything we have belongs to God. We should tithe and manage God's money like He would. Christmas is a time of giving because God is the biggest giver of all!

It gives him a sense of worth because people look to him for what\u2019s cool. But when a surprise visit from his cousin Matty challenges him on what he\u2019s living for, Brandon starts helping others and doing more with his life.

Pretty neat!\n\nCHORUS \nAnd she was all like\nWhoa! That just blew my mind\nCan you tell it to me one more time?\nCount me in\nYeah, that sounds amazing\nHey! Did you just say\nThe Son of God is on his way\nAnd He\u2019s coming as a little baby?\nYep! That\u2019s right\nWhoa! That just blew my mind\n\nVERSE 2\nNow this is Joseph \n\u201cSup?\u201d \nHe\u2019s Mary\u2019s dude \nThe angel came and \nTalked to him too\nSaying, \u201cHit the road,\nYou gotta pack up and go\nTo Beth-le-hem\u201d\nSo they saddled up their donkey, but\nWhen they got to Bethlehem \nThere was no place to stay\nYeah, there was no room at the inn\n\nCHORUS \nAnd they were like\nWhoa! That just blows my mind\nMary stopped and said, \u201cIt's time!\u201d\nShe gave birth to Jesus \nAnd laid Him in a manger of\nHay\u2014like, literal hay\nWas everywhere\nAll in their face\nBut it was perfect\nYeah, the Savior had come\n\nBRIDGE \nAnd just when you thought \nIt couldn\u2019t get any better\nSome angels appeared \nTo nearby shepherds \nThey filled the sky \nAll singing together \n\u201cPeace on earth!\u201d\n\nCHORUS \nAnd all the shepherds were like\nWhoa! That just blew my mind\nLet\u2019s go see with our own eyes\nThe baby Jesus\nLet\u2019s spread the Good News\nThen guess what\nWhat?\nEight days later\nAnna and Simeon met their Savior\nAt the temple God\u2019s promise \nHad finally come true\n\nINTERLUDE\nPhew!\nThat\u2019s all that happened, right?\nUhhh \u2026\n\nVERSE 3\nNo! Then three wisemen came\nTraveling from far away\nFollowing a brightly shining \nStar in the sky\nPlus! They brought fancy gifts\nLike gold and myrrh \nAnd frankincense \nBut honestly some diapers \nWould\u2019ve been just fine\n\nOUTRO\nSo that\u2019s the story \nOf the very first Christmas\nAnd just like everything it\u2019s all about\nIt\u2019s all about Jesus\nYeah!\nIf you\u2019ve heard it once\nOr you\u2019ve heard it like \nA million gazillion times\nWhenever you think about it\nIt will blow your mind like\nWhooooooa!\n\n\nPARENTS: \nDo you have questions or prayer requests?
