      "description": "The Bible is no ordinary book. It's all about God, and how much he loves us. Now, you might think the Bible is a big long list of rules and names, but it\u2019s not! You might also think it\u2019s about a bunch of perfect people who always followed God\u2019s rules.\n\nActually, the Bible is a bunch of stories, poems, letters, and even songs -- that are all telling ONE BIG STORY -- that have been put together into one big book. And everything in the Bible is true! Like how God created the whole world and everything in it. And the stories about Jesus, God\u2019s son. And in between, there are LOTS of stories written by all kinds of people. But the amazing thing about the Bible is, all these stories came from God! \n\nThe first part of the Bible is called the Old Testament. It tells the story of God\u2019s special family, the Israelites, and how God promised that through them he would bless the whole world. To help them do that, God gave them \u201cThe Torah,\u201d or The Law. These were ways for the Israelites to live differently than other nations -- by welcoming people who were different from them, forgiving each other, and following God. \n\nThe only problem was, no one was able to follow ALL the rules. This is what the middle part of the Bible is about. People tried as hard as they could, but they kept making mistakes. And every time, God forgave them and promised them that someone would come, a King, a Rescuer, who would actually follow all of God's rules and show us what God is like.\n\nWell, Israel waited a LONG time for the King who was also the Rescuer. While they were waiting, Israel had good kings and not-so-good kings. Sometimes the people in charge forgot about God and started to worship other gods. And sometimes they even got taken over by other countries. \n\nAnd whenever God would do something amazing -- like when he saved three guys from a fiery furnace, or when he sent messages to prophets like Jeremiah or Ezekiel -- or even when ordinary people like Ruth decided to be part of God\u2019s family -- people would write it down. They wanted to remember what God had done, and teach their kids what God was like: he\u2019s powerful, he\u2019s loving, and he\u2019s GOOD.\n\nIn some stories, God reminds us he\u2019s a good king -- powerful and mighty, someone who saves his people from danger. In other stories, God reminds us he\u2019s a good father taking care of his children. Or like a good shepherd, gently taking care of his sheep. \nNow that\u2019s all in the Old Testament. The next part, the New Testament, starts with four books full of stories about Jesus!\n\nJesus was God\u2019s Son, and he lived a perfect life without breaking any of God\u2019s rules. He taught people about God, and showed people how to be like him, by helping those who were poor and sick. Then, Jesus died for our wrong choices and came back to life -- which was a pretty amazing thing!\n\nIt was so amazing, that people made sure they wrote down the stories about Jesus. And as more and more people started following Jesus, there were more amazing stories to write down! Like when the Holy Spirit came down like wind on Pentecost. Or when people who followed Jesus performed miracles.Or even when one of Jesus\u2019s friends, John, had a crazy dream about what it will be like when Jesus comes back to rule the entire world.\n\nAfter Jesus came back to life and then went to heaven -- yeah, that happened! -- people who followed Jesus wanted to put together all these stories about the Law, the Israelites, Jesus, and the early church -- into one big book. It took a few tries before everyone agreed on what parts should be in what order. But that\u2019s how we have this big book called the Bible.\n\nToday, people still read the Bible all over the world, because what was true a long time ago, is still true today! God always stays the same. God still speaks to us, he forgives us and loves us, and he\u2019s always GOOD. And when we read the Bible, we can still learn about who God is, and what he\u2019s like.\n\nThe Bible says, \u201cAll Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.\u201d (2 Tim 3:16 NLT)\n\nAnd THAT\u2019s the story of the Bible.\n\nSo in case you missed it, here\u2019s the quick version: The Bible is a book of stories about God. The Old Testament is about Israel. The New Testament is about Jesus and his followers. We can still learn about God today.\n\nAnd THAT\u2019s a part of God\u2019s Story.",

      "description": "So in the Bible, there are all these stories about people in the WILDERNESS. They\u2019re usually there for a reason, like either God\u2019s going to prove something to them, or He wants THEM to prove something to HIM. \n\nI know, super epic. Let\u2019s GO find some WILDERNESS.\n\nThis is Wilderness. It\u2019s actually a region in Israel that used to be called Moab\u2026 Today, you can find it on a map just west of the Dead Sea. I mean, LOOK at this place. It\u2019s dry, it\u2019s dusty, it\u2019s hot. There isn\u2019t any shade because not much grows here. It\u2019s uncomfortable. You get sweaty and thirsty just being out here for ten minutes. When the Bible talks about Wilderness, it\u2019s a dangerous desert. There are rocks and cliffs and nasty dangerous animals -- like the deathstalker scorpion and one of the most poisonous snakes in the world, the black adder. It\u2019s where God would send people to be TESTED. When God rescued the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt, he had Moses take them through the Red Sea and into the Wilderness. \n\nGod was TESTING Israel to see if they would TRUST him. Fast-forward a LOOOONG time. The Wilderness is still there when Jesus steps onto the scene. Matthew chapter 4 says, \u201cJesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. After fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. The devil came to him and said, \u201cIf you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become bread.\u201d \n\nNow think about this for a minute. Jesus is in the Wilderness where Moses and the Israelites had been tested -- and he\u2019s thirsty and hungry, just like they were thirsty and hungry! The Israelites had to learn to trust that God would give them food and water. How did Jesus handle this temptation? Does he do some magic trick to turn stones into bread? No! He says, \u201cIt is written: \u2018Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.\u2019\u201d Jesus KNEW his Bible! He knew that the whole point of the story was whether people would choose to trust God, or not. Jesus trusted God even when he was hungry -- because he knew it wasn\u2019t food that kept him alive, it was God!\n\nThe devil knew the Bible, too, though. \u201cThen the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. \u201cIf you are the Son of God,\u201d he said, \u201cthrow yourself down.\u201d Then the devil quoted the Bible! He said, \u201cFor it is written: \u2018He will command his angels concerning you, and they will lift you up in their hands, so that you will not strike your foot against a stone.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s an exact quote from Psalm 91! But Jesus quoted the Bible right back. \u201cIt is also written: \u2018Do not put the Lord your God to the test.\u201d\n\nThe devil tempted Jesus a THIRD time, this time on a high mountain like this. Jesus could see cities, whole kingdoms, from up here. The devil said, \u201cAll this I will give you, if you will bow down and worship me.\u201d But Jesus shut down temptation a third time! \u201cAway from me, Satan! For it is written: \u2018Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.\u2019\u201d\n\nWHOO! Jesus passed the test three times. Every time, Jesus remembered things God had said: that we should worship him alone. That God is the one who tests us, not the other way around. And that we should TRUST him.\n\nNow, you don\u2019t have to go to the actual Wilderness to be tested. You might be tested the next time you have to wait for something and need to be patient. You might be going through something that FEELS like a wilderness -- you might feel alone or scared or even mad at God. Or you might even feel tempted to do something you know you\u2019re not supposed to do. \n\nSo what do you think? What\u2019s like \u201cthe Wilderness\u201d in YOUR life? Are there times you feel tempted not to trust God, or not to obey him? When do you feel worried that God won\u2019t take care of you? \n\nWhatever is going on, GOD IS WITH YOU. And that\u2019s true wherever you are.",

      "description": "Happy Easter! Today you\u2019re going to hear about the most incredible story EVER!!! It\u2019s the story of Easter. It\u2019s about a man named Jesus who changed the world forever. Jesus was a real guy who really lived in a real place called Israel. \n\nHe was a great teacher and he did miracles and healed people, but most importantly, he was God\u2019s son. Born as a baby, but actually a king! He showed people how to be a part of the Kingdom of God. And that got him in some trouble with the powerful religious leaders, who wanted people to keep following them and doing things like they had always been done. They were so scared of the change Jesus was bringing that they actually decided to kill Jesus. And they did. But...Jesus came back to life. \n\nIn fact, that\u2019s the big idea for Easter: Jesus died and came back to life...for US! Earlier this year, Kids' Club went to Israel to see some of the places where Jesus actually lived and where he spent his time. And we wanted YOU to be able to see it too! \n\nIf you want to check out more stuff about Easter or you have more questions about what it means to follow Jesus, go to crossroadskidsclub.net/easter.

      "description": "Happy Easter! Today you\u2019re going to hear about the most incredible story EVER!!! It\u2019s the story of Easter. It\u2019s about a man named Jesus who changed the world forever. Jesus was a real guy who really lived in a real place called Israel. \n\nHe was a great teacher and he did miracles and healed people, but most importantly, he was God\u2019s son. Born as a baby, but actually a king! He showed people how to be a part of the Kingdom of God. And that got him in some trouble with the powerful religious leaders, who wanted people to keep following them and doing things like they had always been done. They were so scared of the change Jesus was bringing that they actually decided to kill Jesus. And they did. But...Jesus came back to life. \n\nIn fact, that\u2019s the big idea for Easter: Jesus died and came back to life...for US! Earlier this year, Kids' Club went to Israel to see some of the places where Jesus actually lived and where he spent his time. And we wanted YOU to be able to see it too! \n\nIf you want to check out more stuff about Easter or you have more questions about what it means to follow Jesus, go to crossroadskidsclub.net/easter.

      "description": "So part of God\u2019s story is about what happened in the forty days after Jesus came back to life, and it goes like this.\n\nRemember when Jesus came to earth, healed people, taught people about the Kingdom of God and then died for the punishment we deserve? And then how he came back to life?! It\u2019s all true. That really happened. But it took some time for Jesus\u2019 followers to hear this Good News.\n\nLike two men who were walking together to a place called Emmaus. It was the same day that Jesus\u2019 tomb had been found empty, but they didn\u2019t know this. All they knew was Jesus had just died. And they were sad and confused because they had thought he would save their people and change everything. And they were scared because they had no idea what to expect now that he was gone. \n\nThey had heard that some women went to Jesus\u2019 tomb, but he wasn\u2019t in it. Instead there were angels, and they told them, \u201cHe\u2019s not here. He is risen!\u201d! But these were all still just stories to the two men. \n\nAs they walked and talked, another man appeared and began walking beside them. It was Jesus, but they didn\u2019t recognize him. The man asked them what they were talking about. They couldn\u2019t believe this stranger didn\u2019t know what had just happened in Jerusalem. It was the biggest news in the land. So they told this man about Jesus. How he had been a great teacher and prophet, how he had healed people, but then was arrested and killed. \n\nThey walked and talked with Jesus for the rest of the day, still not recognizing that they were talking to Jesus. In fact, it wasn\u2019t until dinner that they realized it was him. And as soon as they did, Jesus was gone. Just...disappeared. \n\nThe two men didn\u2019t waste any time getting back to Jerusalem to tell their friends what had happened. They found them hiding together, with all the doors locked and the windows shut tight. See, after Jesus was killed, it was dangerous to be known as his disciple. So they were scared. \n\nBut the two men told them that the rumors were true. Jesus had risen and they had seen him, talked to him and eaten with him! And as they were telling this story, Jesus appeared to the disciples again. Even though the doors and windows were locked. Maybe they thought they were seeing a ghost. Maybe some of them weren\u2019t even sure it was him. But Jesus knew their doubts and told them, \u201cSee my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.\u201d \n\nThis was the same Jesus they knew. The same Jesus they had watched teach crowds and heal people. He was real. Not a ghost. Not a dream. It was Jesus and he was right there with them.\n\nBut this wasn\u2019t the last time Jesus would appear to his friends. Later, Peter and some of the other disciples went to the Sea of Galilee. They stayed up all night long fishing, but didn\u2019t catch a single thing. In the morning, a man called to them from the shore. \u201cDo you have any fish??\u201d. \n\nNow this was Jesus, but just like before, the disciples didn\u2019t recognize him. When they told this stranger that, no, in fact they hadn\u2019t caught any fish at all, he told them, \u201cThrow your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some.\u201d They did as he said and immediately, the net was completely full of fish.\n\nRight then, one of the disciples in the boat, John, knew that he was seeing Jesus. He Peter jumped in the water and got to shore as fast as he could. When he got there, there was a fire with bread and fish on the hot coals. There, the disciples and Jesus ate breakfast together, just like they had before. And they all knew without a doubt that this was Jesus.\n\nAfter this, Jesus appeared to over 500 people. And later, the Bible says Jesus was taken up into heaven. But just because Jesus wasn\u2019t on earth with his friends didn\u2019t mean they were alone. Jesus had told them he would leave, but he also said he would send the Holy Spirit to be with them. And that one day, he WILL come back and make everything new.\n\nAnd THAT\u2019s the story of what happened after the tomb.\n\nSo in case you missed it, here\u2019s the quick version: Jesus died. He came back to life. He spent time with his friends. He was taken up into heaven. He sent His Holy Spirit. And he\u2019ll be back again. \n\nAnd THAT is a part of God\u2019s story.",

We\u2019d love to hear from you.\n\nSo part of God\u2019s Story is about a shepherd and a lost sheep, and it goes like this.\n\nJesus spent a lot of time teaching people about God\u2019s love. And sometimes, people wanted to spend time with Jesus after he got finished teaching -- so they would invite him over for dinner. Jesus loved to spend time with people. Jesus would even hang out with people who no one else wanted to hang out with.\n\nThis bothered some other people called Pharisees. Pharisees were religious experts who thought it was WRONG for Jesus to spend time with certain kinds of people. One day, the Pharisees muttered, \u201cJesus welcomes sinners -- and eats with them!\u201d \n\nBut Jesus knew God still loves people, even when we make wrong choices. So Jesus told the Pharisees a story to teach them a lesson about God. These stories were called \u201cparables.\u201d \n\nThis is the Parable of the One Lost Sheep. Jesus said:\n\nSuppose you were a shepherd with one hundred sheep.\nAnd one of your sheep got lost. Wouldn\u2019t you leave the ninety-nine, in open country, and go after the sheep until you found it? And when you found it, you would joyfully put the sheep on your shoulders and take it home. And when you got home, you would call your friends and neighbors together and say, \u201cRejoice with me! I have found my lost sheep!\u201d\n\nThe people listening were probably thinking about the shepherds they knew. Good shepherds paid attention to their sheep, they knew each one by name, and they kept them safe from danger. They would have remembered the poems by the prophet Ezekiel and King David where God said he was like a shepherd. Of course a good shepherd would want ALL of his sheep to be safe, and would do whatever it took to rescue his one lost sheep -- even risking his own life!\n\nThen Jesus explained the parable to the Pharisees. \u201cIn the same way, there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who do not need to repent.\u201d\n\nSee, the ninety-nine sheep are like people who already believe in Jesus. The lost sheep are like the people who don\u2019t know how much God loves them, or that Jesus came to rescue them. And Jesus is the good shepherd, who was willing to lay down his own life to rescue his lost sheep. \n\nJesus said that he \u201ccame to seek and save those who are lost\u201d.\n\nWhen a person starts to follow Jesus, Jesus said it\u2019s like a party in heaven! We don\u2019t really know exactly what a party in heaven looks like. But since God made everything, and God is the reason good things like love and fun and laughter exist, a party in heaven is probably bigger and better than anything we could imagine. And Jesus wants everyone to know that it\u2019s a party where EVERYONE is invited.\n\nBecause EVERY single person matters to God. \n\nAnd THAT\u2019s the story of the shepherd and one lost sheep.\n\nIn case you missed it, here\u2019s the quick version.\n\nJesus told stories called parables. One parable is about a shepherd and one hundred sheep. One sheep got lost. The shepherd left the ninety-nine. The lost sheep was found! The shepherd threw a party. Because God cares about every single person.\n\nAnd THAT\u2019s a part of God\u2019s Story.\n\nSources: Matt 18:1-14, Luke 15:1-7, Ezekiel 34:11-16",

      "description": "Jesus told a parable about how God's Kingdom is like a vineyard owner and his workers. Sometimes, we may think others don\u2019t deserve to be invited to be part of God\u2019s Kingdom, but Jesus said that EVERYONE is invited to be part of his family, no matter who we are, what we\u2019ve done, or even what we will do!
