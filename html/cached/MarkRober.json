      "description": "A description of a relatively simple Halloween costume using 2 iPad2s to make it look like you have a huge hole in your torso.  You'll also need a MiFi hotspot (if you don't have a WiFi network available where you want to use the costume).  Basically you start a FaceTime chat between the iPads and then tape one to your front and one to your back.  Add a little red paint and you're good to go.  It's supposed to look like you have a gaping hole in your torso.\n\nCheck out my Channel: http://www.youtube.com/user/onemeeeliondollars\n\nFollow me on twitter: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRober\n\nFacebook Fan Page: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTube\n\n\nNOTE: The iPads were borrowed.  This costume cost me $4 to buy a white shirt a Goodwill.   If you spend more time than I did on the blood and the flesh part and lining up the iPads it could look pretty cool.",

For example, does clapping even matter?  Can you hear a clap from down on the field?  So I attended an actual football game to get some baseline loudness measurements and then went back to USC's Coliseum when it was empty and had 3 friends cycle through 11 different cheering styles in 12 different locations. Then I compared and ranked the best ways to cheer to make you a superfan for your next sporting event.\n\n\n\nPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub\n\n****************************************\u00ad\n\nI make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:\n\nCHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTube\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTube\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRober\n\nINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/",

Basically, you throw a dart and then a Vicon motion capture system tracks the dart in the air.  We use those x,y,z positions in matlab to predict where the dart will land using some regression analysis.  Once we know where it will land, we move the board to the right spot using 6 stepper motors that attach to the back of the board using fishing line.  All of this happens in 400ms or so.  Then we took it to a bar to see what people would think of it (SPOILER ALERT: they liked it)\n\n\nPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub\n\n****************************************\u00ad\n\nI make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:\n\nCHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTube\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTube\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRober\n\nINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/",

We looked at some samples from some pools in my area to determine how much pee was in them and I conducted an experiment of my own to see what was the cause of that \"classic pool smell\".

That made me curious about what kind of person doesn't return a found wallet.  So I got 200 wallets and dropped them in 10 cities to collect data to rank the honesty of the cities and to build a profile of an honest person.  We looked at variables such as male v. female, age, high income v. low income, religious v. non-religious, small town v. big town.  \n\n\nMERCH-\nBy popular demand I have shirts now!

Anytime you have a sudden change in cross-sectional area in the horn you will get waves reflecting back at the source.  You don't want that because that is wasted energy that could have moved forward.  Even if it goes from a small cross-section to a larger, if you do it suddenly you get those wasted waves.  So you want the horn to basically be asymptotic at the exit so you never have a jump in discontinuity when it exits to the wide open air.  So a directors cone isn't as good as the curved shapes I showed because it still has the sudden change when it dumps into the open air.\n\n\n\nMUSIC-\n0:10- Arrow- Andrew Applepie - http://andrewapplepie.com/\n1:08- Dance- Danijel Zambo- https://danijel-zambo.bandcamp.com/\n2:00- Kalimba Jam- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n3:00- New shoes- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n7:30- Ceral Killa- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n8:47- Q- Blue Wednesday - https://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday/\n9:46 Too Happy to be cool by Notebreak- https://soundcloud.com/notebreak/dubstep-too-happy-to-be-cool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary:  I made a huge horn and broke glass with it and explored why horns are shaped the way they are.\n\n\n\nMERCH-\nThey are soft- https://teespring.com/stores/markrober\n\n\nPLEASE CONSIDER SUBSCRIBING: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-Sub\n\n****************************************\u00ad\n\nI make videos like this once a month all year long while supplies last:\n\nCHECK OUT MY CHANNEL: http://tinyurl.com/MarkRober-YouTube\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/MarkRoberYouTube\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/#!/MarkRober\n\nINSTAGRAM:  https://www.instagram.com/markrober/",

You'll also notice my doctor was Bob Newby from Stranger Things.  Turns out there is a lot of personal info on a Covid result test and the part that says negative and positive wasn't easily readable so I photoshopped up something that solved both of those issues and didn't bother changing the date.  No conspiracy here.  I promise I actually got Covid and would have much preferred to actually filmed on the original schedule and not had to deal with it even with the private jet silver lining.\n\nHere is a link to that tiny exercise machine I was using the the jet.

Enrollment is now open until Dec 27 at Monthly.com/MarkRober (link also in bio).\n\nThis class is a hands-on, 30-day learning experience that will teach you how to use engineering and science to bring your creative ideas to life.\n\nDuring this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life.\n\nThe best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own.\n\nThis is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer.\n\nThe class officially starts on January 4, 2021, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested!\n\nSee you in class!\n\n-Mark",

Sensitivity to sensory stimuli, like Light and Sound?\n2. Do you notice details that other people don't?\n3. Do you consider yourself \"Highly Sensitive\"?\n4. \"You have many enthusiasms and get deeply fulfilled by diving into a subject\" not sure what the question there would be?\n5. Do you have difficulty doing things that other people find easy (like making phonecalls)?\n6. Do you feel like an outsider but are unable to figure out why?\n7. Have you lost friends without knowing what you did or what went wrong?\n8. Do you need time to recharge from social situations. \n9. When super stressed, do you explode out of nowhere in an uncharacteristic way?\n10. Do you find it hard to let things go? Do you ruminate on potential outcomes of a situation before or after the fact?\n11. Are your vocal or facial expressions different from a lot of people?\n12. Do you have difficulty organizing daily tasks?\n13. Growing up, did you have a fascination with countercultures? Non-traditional interests?\n14. Do people call you quirky, shy, or rude without you knowing what you did to acquire those labels?\n15. Are you uninterested in the concept of conforming to society's views of you (especially with regards to gender or sexuality?)\n16. Do you have nervous ticks such as picking, fidgeting, or tapping that you can't quit without picking up other bad habbits?\n17. Can other people easily manipulate you without you realizing what they're doing?\n18.

During this class, I'm going to share with you my entire creative engineering process from start to finish. You're going to follow along with me as I fully design and engineer 3 brand new builds from scratch... from how I come up the idea, all the way through bringing the final builds to life. The best part is, over the month, you'll follow along with me and my process, side by side, and you will leave the class with 3 original, creative builds of your own. This is the class I wish I had when I was starting out. It's designed to take your skills to make cool stuff to the next level, whether you're a beginner or a more experienced maker/engineer. The class officially starts in early Jan, and it will only run a few times per year, so claim your spot if you're interested! See you in class!
