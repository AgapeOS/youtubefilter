We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!",

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!",

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!",

We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!",

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!",

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth. Thank you for being here, and for being a part of our amazing supporters, the Cim Fam!",

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.

We grew up singing in a big family of 11 children and our mom, a classical pianist, taught us to sing in harmony when we were kids. We got our start in musical theatre productions, doing classical pieces in the church choir and performing barbershop harmonies at nursing homes for the elderly (back then our grandma was our agent). \n\nIn 2009, when Christina was 18 years old and Lauren was 10 years old, we posted a cover of us singing Party In The USA that ended up going viral. From that video, we were discovered by a manager in London, and shortly after signed with Universal Music Group under Island Records. We moved to Los Angeles in 2010, where we lived and worked in the L.A. pop music world for 5 years, before getting extremely burnt out. We realized a major label deal wasn\u2019t for us, left our label and moved to Nashville, TN, looking for a new start. In 2015, we officially became Nashville-based, independent artists. \n\nSince then, we have written and released 5 albums of original music, toured all over the U.S., South America, and Europe, performed at festivals in Germany, Spain and the Philippines, wrote a book, Believe In You: Big Sister Stories and Advice on Living Your Best Life, started a podcast (The Cimorelli Podcast) and reached over 1 billion views on our YouTube channel. Currently, the 5 of us sisters are embarking on new journeys of marriage and starting our own families (Christina, Katherine and Lisa), and figuring out life as twenty-somethings (Lauren and Amy). \n\nOur goal with our YouTube channel is to constantly challenge ourselves to grow creatively, and to make videos and music that is positive, uplifting and innovative. Our Christian faith guides our decisions, and we will always create content that is family friendly, while not being afraid to touch on topics that we believe are important, such as mental health and personal growth.
