      "description": "Aaron \u201cWheelz\u201d Fotheringham is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints\u2014commonly referred to as a Mormon or Latter-day Saint. He\u2019s also an elite wheelchair motocross (WXMC) athlete and has performed some of the riskiest world record\u2013setting wheelchair stunts. He was born with Spina Bifida and was in a wheelchair by the time he was 8 years old. That\u2019s when he started to develop his wheelchair skills at a local skate park and he\u2019s never looked back. \n\nAt 18, Aaron \u201cWheelz\u201d found himself touring the world with elite action sports athletes. Those long tours took him away from his weekly Church meetings. In time, with all his trick progressions, he noticed some spiritual regression. After struggling with wondering if he\u2019d ever feel happiness in the gospel again, Aaron turned to the Savior, Jesus Christ. Once he realized that Christ was always there to save him and that he just needed to turn to Him, Christ\u2019s redeeming joy filled his life again.\n\nAaron \u201cWheelz\u201d believes anyone can overcome challenges when one has faith, hope and the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the Youth Channel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the latest videos: https://bit.ly/2Ws96cP\n\nFollow us on INSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/2WIggKr\nListen on SPOTIFY: https://spoti.fi/3eAcM2G\nListen on APPLE MUSIC: https://apple.co/2CJ1Y4M\nVisit us on our WEBSITE: www.ChurchOfJesusChrist.org/youth",

They gathered as teams\u2014young men vs. young women\u2014and made banku and okra soup. \n\nBanku and okra soup is a crowd-pleasing African dish. Banku is a mixture of fermented corn and cassava dough and is often served with soup. Okra soup is made with fish, smoked turkey, okra, and other vegetables and seasonings. \n\nWhen children and youth learn to lead, they gain confidence, build friendships, and become empowered. #StriveToBe\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the Youth Channel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the latest videos: https://bit.ly/2Ws96cP\n\nFollow us on INSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/2WIggKr\nListen on SPOTIFY: https://spoti.fi/3eAcM2G\nListen on APPLE MUSIC: https://apple.co/2CJ1Y4M\nVisit us on our WEBSITE: www.ChurchOfJesusChrist.org/youth",

So the rock came down on top of me, and it crushed my foot. I looked at my leg and I like immediately started screaming. And when I was sitting there I was just hoping not to die.\u201d\n\n Mists of darkness all around me. \nBeen so long since I have seen the sun.\n Filthy waters try to drown me. \nI\u2019ll never make it on my own.\n\n\u201cImmediately we started to pray. I was praying just to stay alive and for help.\u201d\n\n So my knees hit the floor, only half of a whole \n\u2018cause I need something bigger than me.\n And the tears that I cry rising up to the sky \nbring the hope and relief that I need.\n\nWhen I hear Your voice, it\u2019s like You come and part the waters,\nlead me through the darkness.\nWhen I hear Your voice, everything is so much clearer, \nmade it through the winter.\nAnd I know, that Your love will lead me home.\nWhen I hear Your voice, when I hear Your voice.\n\n\u201cThere was some hard night, nights I wouldn\u2019t sleep at all, I would just lay there groaning or crying. I remember my amputation surgery, opening my eyes, sitting up, and looking down at my foot. I said to my dad, \u2018that\u2019s smaller than I thought.\u2019\u201d\n\n Flowing down like revelation, \nbringing peace into my soul.\n The words You whisper in the darkness, \nshow a love I\u2019ve never known.\n \nSo my knees hit the floor only half of a whole \n \u2018Cause I need something bigger than me\n And the tears that I cry rising up to the sky\n Bring the hope and relief that I need.\n \nWhen I hear Your voice, it\u2019s like You come and part the waters,\n Lead me through the darkness.\n When I hear Your voice, everything is so much clearer,\n Made it through the winter.\n And I know, that Your love will lead me home. \n When I hear Your voice, when I hear Your voice.\n\n\u201cWhen the amputation happened, I was surrounded by this dark mist, but even at our darkest moments, when we feel alone, we can always turn towards God. And if we stay close to Him, He will help us and He will be there to guide us and strengthen us. It always gets better.\u201d\n\n I hear You, You save me, I follow, You change me, You make me like I need to be.\n You tell me Your secrets, You love me, I feel it, I know I will always believe.\n I hear You, You save me, I follow, You change me, You make me like I need to be.\n You tell me Your secrets, You love me, I feel it, I know I will always believe.\n \nWhen I hear Your voice, it\u2019s like You come and part the waters\n Lead me through the darkness.\n When I hear Your voice, everything is so much clearer,\n Made it through the winter.\n And I know, that Your love will lead me home. \nWhen I hear Your voice, when I hear Your voice.\nWhen I hear Your voice, when I hear Your voice, when I hear Your voice.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the Youth Channel of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for the latest videos: https://bit.ly/2Ws96cP\n\nFollow us on INSTAGRAM: https://bit.ly/2WIggKr\nListen on SPOTIFY: https://spoti.fi/3eAcM2G\nListen on APPLE MUSIC: https://apple.co/2CJ1Y4M\nVisit us on our WEBSITE: www.ChurchOfJesusChrist.org/youth",

We all go through struggles and times of questioning, but we can CHOOSE to SERVE the Lord in spite of these struggles. Decide now to serve the Lord--even if the waters rise, even through the endless night--and He will NEVER leave YOUR side, either.\n\nHave you DECIDED to serve the Lord? Tell us in the comments below!\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Lyrics:\n\nIt\u2019s written in the stars;\nI signed my name.\nI\u2019m carrying this torch\nTo my grave.\nIt\u2019s burned into the fabric of my soul.\nThough I know it\u2019s not an easy road,\nThe One who made the world has made me free.\nAnd I already know my destiny,\nWith every beat that\u2019s left inside my heart.\n\nChorus:\nI will serve the Lord,\nEven if I stand alone.\nI\u2019ve decided long ago.\nThough the ground may shake me,\nI won\u2019t let it change me.\nI will serve the Lord\nEven if the waters rise.\nEven through the endless night,\nMy faith is firmly set in stone.\nAnd I will serve the Lord.\nOh. Mm.\n\nThose who hear my voice\nDo what you will.\nBut I\u2019ll never leave the peace\nThat I feel.\nIt takes me to a higher holier place,\nAnd despite the struggles that I face,\nHe gives me all the grace that I could need.\nAnd I already know my destiny,\nWith all the strength that\u2019s left inside my soul.\n\nChorus:\nI will serve the Lord,\nEven if I stand alone.\nI\u2019ve decided long ago.\nThough the ground may shake me,\nI won\u2019t let it change me.\nI will serve the Lord\nEven if the waters rise.\nEven through the endless night,\nMy faith is firmly set in stone.\nAnd I will serve the Lord.\nOh.

The world is crumbling at our feet.\nThe skies are filled with gray.\nThe Savior\u2019s calling to His sheep,\nAnd He will lead the way.\nWe know His voice;\nWe\u2019ve heard it before.\nWe know the words He says.\nHe is the light.\nWe\u2019ll follow Him to the end.\n[Chorus]\nThough fires may burn\nAnd storms may rage,\nWhen darkness comes,\nWe\u2019ll find our way back home.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nThough tears may fall\nAnd friends may leave,\nWe see His light,\nAnd that\u2019s where we will go.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\n\n2. We won\u2019t be blinded by the rain;\nThe path we\u2019re on is clear.\nThere may be mountains on the way,\nBut we choose faith, not fear.\nHe opens our eyes,\nFills us with peace,\nLifts up our weary souls.\nHe is the light, and we\u2019ll never be,\nWe\u2019ll never be alone.\n[Chorus]\nThough fires may burn\nAnd storms may rage,\nWhen darkness comes,\nWe\u2019ll find our way back home.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nThough tears may fall\nAnd friends may leave,\nWe see His light,\nAnd that\u2019s where we will go.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\n\nWith all of our hearts,\nWe won\u2019t trust in the world,\nWe\u2019ll trust in the One who made us all.\n[Chorus]\nThough fires may burn\nAnd storms may rage,\nWhen darkness comes\nWe\u2019ll find our way back home.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nThough tears may fall\nAnd friends may leave,\nWe see His light,\nAnd that\u2019s where we will go.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nWe will trust in the Lord.\nWords and music by Nik Day\nArranged by Mitch Davis\nProduced by Mitch Davis\nArtist: Lizzy Newbold\n\u00a9 2022 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

Your spirits will RISE from the Dust with each note the bass DROPS. No matter how far WE have fallen, Jesus Christ breaks our chains and sets us free to RISE UP from who we were into someone new.

We can try trusting in something other than Jesus Christ, but it would be like building a mansion in the sand--easily washed away.

We are never alone when we choose to follow Jesus Christ.\n\nWhen have you chosen to put God first in your life?

Everyone will face challenges, but how we face those challenges will determine our joy in this life and in the world to come. Do we trust that Heavenly Father hears and answers our prayers? Do we believe Jesus Christ when He says that His yoke is easy and His burden is light? How about the angel's promise to Mary: \"For with God nothing shall be impossible\"? (Luke 1:37). His promises are sure. Whatever we need to do can be done--with Christ.\n\nWords and Music by Nik Day\nArranged by Mitch Davis and Nik Day\nProduced by Mitch Davis\nArtist: Jarica Jamison\n\n\ud83c\udfa7 Lyrics: \n\nThrough my hills and valleys,\nEvery storm-tossed sea,\nI can feel my Savior\nSo close to me.\n\nHe leads me forward\nThrough paths unknown,\nAnd when my strength is gone, He heals my weary soul \n\nPre-chorus:\nAnd shows me who I could be.\nHe stays with me,\nAnd I know\n\nChorus: \nI can do all things.\nWhen I\u2019m sinking in the waves,\nIf I reach out for His grace,\nHe will rescue me.\nI can do all things\nWith the Savior by my side.\nI can climb to greater heights,\nFind the strength I need.\nI can do all things with Christ.\nI can do all things with Christ.\n\nI will cross that desert\nThough it\u2019s far and wide.\nWhen I feel the hunger\nAnd I hear the lies\n\nPre-Chorus:\nI will pray to heaven,\nAnd the winds will cease. \nWith my Savior as my guide, I know that\n\nChorus:\nI can do all things.\nWhen I\u2019m sinking in the waves,\nIf I reach out for His grace,\nHe will rescue me.\nI can do all things\nWith the Savior by my side.\nI can climb to greater heights,\nFind the strength I need.\nI can do all things with Christ.\nI can do all things with Christ.\n\nBridge:\nIf I\u2019m locked inside a prison cell, He breaks my chains.\nWhen I\u2019m laid into the grave, He rolls the stone away.\nWhen I face my fears and follow Him with all my faith,\nHe gives me strength. \n\nChorus\nSo I can do all things\nWhen I\u2019m sinking in the waves,\nIf I reach out for His grace,\nHe will rescue me.\nI can do all things\nWith the Savior by my side.\nI can climb to greater heights,\nFind the strength I need.\nI can do all things with Christ.\nI can do all things with Christ.\n\nChapters:\n00:00 \u2013 00:13 Introduction\n00:14 \u2013 00:36 First Verse\n00:37 \u2013 00:46 Pre-Chorus\n00:47 \u2013 01:23 Chorus\n01:24 \u2013 01:45 Second Verse\n01:46 \u2013 02:23 Chorus\n02:24 \u2013 02:45 Bridge\n02:46 \u2013 03:33 Chorus\n03:34 \u2013 03:46 Ending\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL! #strivetobe is a place for youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and other followers of Jesus Christ around the globe to gather, share inspirational stories, and connect in our #love of Jesus Christ through #music!

We may have questions. We may have doubts. There are certainly things we don't know or yet understand, but we can choose to lean into what we do know. We can choose to trust the Lord. We can choose to stay committed to Him even when life get hard. He doesn't want us to commit a portion of ourselves to Him, He wants us to go all in. \n\nAre you COMMITTED to Jesus Christ? Are you giving him ALL your heart?

You think you\u2019re through.  \nBut every day the Savior\u2019s making mountains move. \n\nChorus: \nAnd it\u2019s not hopeless. \nHe is the hope you need. \nWhen the weight of the world seems heavy, \nHe\u2019ll come to set you free. \nOh, it\u2019s not hopeless. \nWhenever you can\u2019t, He can.  \nSo give Him all your burdens. \nHe\u2019s got the whole world in His hands. \n\nYou\u2019re feeling like walking out, \nBut it\u2019s all worth the fight, \n\u2018Cause a brand-new day is waiting for you on the other side.  \nJust a bit more and you\u2019ll see you\u2019re unstoppable. \nAnd He is there, just one more prayer, you\u2019ve always known.  \n\nChorus \n\nBridge: \nGive it your all. Know that nothing\u2019s ever stopping you, \nThough it can feel like whole world\u2019s on top of you. \nForget the bad days, though it leaves a bad taste. \nWe\u2019re getting first place, out the way we\u2019re coming through. \n\nIf it\u2019s looking down, it could be the opposite.  \nThings are always looking up when you\u2019re an optimist.  \nOne door closes, another door opens.  \nIt\u2019s true that it\u2019s not hopeless, I know this. \n\nChorus \n\n__\n\nWe want to hear from you, so join us on the journey!\n\nHow to find us! @strivetobe  \n\u25ba Subscribe to our Channel: https://www.youtube.com/strivetobe  \n\ud83d\udd14 Turn on notifications to stay updated with new uploads!\n\u25ba Follow Strive To Be on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/strivetobe/\n\ud83c\udfb5 Follow StriveToBe on Spotify : @strivetobe  \nhttps://open.spotify.com/artist/66YzHdK0FWCQSKMlXf3Rbj\n\n\u00a9 2023 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc.

I struggled with it for a long time. I felt shame. I\u2019m also very independent. I like to solve things and do it by myself. That was hard for me to overcome\u2014that it\u2019s OK to reach out for help. It\u2019s not a weakness but a strength. \n\nThe Lord was the first person I went to. I was going through a lot, and I needed someone to hold on to. I knew that He wouldn\u2019t judge me and He would always be there and that I could talk to Him about anything. We have infinite worth and value no matter what we\u2019ve been through. \u2014Kira\n\n#AllThingsThroughChrist #lds #ldsyouth #faith #depression \n\nTo learn more from other youth like Kira,\n\u25ba Subscribe to our channel for more FSY content: https://www.youtube.com/strivetobe\n\u25ba Follow Strive to Be on Instagram! https://www.instagram.com/strivetobe/",

Is there somebody who can show me what I\u2019m needing? \n \nChorus: \nYou set me free.\u202f \nYou set me free. \nYou set me free. \nYou set me, \nYou set me, \nYou set me free.\u202f \nYou set me free. \nYou set me free. \nYou set me, \nYou set me, \nYou set me free. \n \nFeels right, \nFollowing my Savior, \u2018cause I know He paid the price for sin. \nNow I\u2014I live my life so different. Yeah, I know that I will follow Him. \n \nPre-Chorus: \nAnd now I know that there\u2019s somebody who can take me to the path that I\u2019m not seeing. \nI get down on my knees. Is there somebody who can show me what I\u2019m needing? \n \nChorus \n\n___\n\n\u00a9 2023 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved.

We hope you find inspiration as you watch this #christianshorts . How do you strengthen your faith in Jesus Christ? \n\nChapters:\n00:00 - 00:20 Derrick's experience as a mechanic \n00:21 - 00:37 Strengthening our everyday lives \n00:38 - 01:00 Derrick's testimony\n\nTranscript:\nI'm a heavy diesel mechanic. And\u00a0my job is to rebuild the trailers, so I take off all the parts that are broken or getting worn out and I put on all-new parts. I'm\u00a0strengthening the trailer. That's what I'm doing. I'm taking off\u00a0the parts that are wearing out and are weakened and I'm\u00a0putting new strong parts on.\n\nI feel like that\u2019s something we need to do in our everyday lives. We need to find areas where we\u2019re weakened or wearing out and we need to strengthen them. I'm not saying you need to\u00a0take your testimony, throw it out the window,\u00a0and get a new one. You need to take your old\u00a0one and build on that.\n\nI'm leaving on my mission soon, and I've always known that I wanted\u00a0to go on my mission ever since I was eight years old. I love sharing\u00a0the good things that I have, and the gospel is probably one of\u00a0the greatest things that I have. If God\u2019s on my side, then I can do anything I need to do, not anything I want to do, anything I need to do. My name is Derrick. I can do all\u00a0things through Christ.\n\n\u00a9 2023 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved. This song may be copied for incidental, noncommercial church or home use.

I had been helping my dad my whole life, just get used to construction\u00a0and power tools, and I just really grew to love it. One hard thing that I had to overcome\u00a0this year with my new house was my employee. My older brother was supposed\u00a0to come home from his mission.\n\nAnd one day on his mission, he\u00a0called me and he said, \u201cSarah, I was asked to extend and\u00a0I just have to do it.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou know what, Tyler? You can't do it because we have\u00a0to get this house done.\u201d He said, \u201cSarah, the Lord's work\u00a0is more important than your work.\u201d And that just hit me. And I\u00a0know that that's so true, and I know that the Lord's work is more important\u00a0than anything that I have going on in my life. But I also know that\u00a0because my older brother is serving a mission, that the Lord is going\u00a0to help make my work possible. My name is Sarah and I can do all things through Christ.\n\n\u00a9 2023 by Intellectual Reserve, Inc. All rights reserved. This song may be copied for incidental, noncommercial church or home use.

I lost 70% of my skin in just two\u00a0days and spent three weeks in a specialized burn unit\u00a0to get treatment. I dealt with severe pain\u00a0while in the hospital and have had some lasting\u00a0complications as a result of this illness.\n\nSince then, I have been able to\u00a0move past these complications. I am now a member of my high\u00a0school swim team and a part of multiple high\u00a0school clubs. Even though it was extremely\u00a0difficult, this experience helped me\u00a0to better know Christ. I felt Him near me, giving\u00a0me emotional and physical strength that I needed to overcome\u00a0this challenge. I have a testimony of Christ's\u00a0role as my Savior. I know He understands exactly\u00a0what we go through. He suffered for all of the sins,\u00a0pains and heartaches that I face. I know He is always on my side. Whenever I reach out to Him, He\u00a0is always there to lift me up.

Today is the summertime and we usually\u00a0take the sheep up to a grazing area. We would keep them out for about eight\u00a0hours a day. We would just watch them. Then we put them in the pen and we walked around it to see if any\u00a0of them are limping or walking funny or any other stuff that could\u00a0be wrong with them.\n\u00a0\nThe Lord is our shepherd, which\u2014I am the shepherd of our sheep. I really like to think of sheep because we are technically His sheep to the Lord. It just is fun to watch over them and\u00a0see how they react to you and eat and stuff.\n\u00a0\nIf we don\u2019t take care of them, then they will usually die of drought or not enough feed. The Lord would help us lead our animals and livestock to the right place and keep them away from danger. It is kind of hard to work sheep, especially with very few people there, but we usually get through it together. My name is Burliegh, and I can do all things through Christ.\n\n--\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL! #strivetobe is a place for youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints across the globe to gather, share inspirational stories, and connect in our #love of Jesus Christ through #music!

When I was going through my eating disorder, I was really too embarrassed to talk to anyone or tell my friends. Even though I didn\u2019t tell them, I still knew that when I was kind of feeling bad about myself, I just went to hang out with Brigham and Eli. We\u2019d just have a good time, and I\u2019d forget my worries. \n\nWith a disease or disorder, it\u2019s just so hard to get out of it. And my parents are always going to be there for me. And I know that. And I know Christ will also be there for me. Even though you may not want to do something at first, like therapy, that will really, really help in the long run, and that will just shape you into becoming who you are. Christ was always there for me, and He helped me through the tough times. My name is Gavin, and I can do all things through Christ.\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL! #strivetobe is a place for youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints across the globe to gather, share inspirational stories, and connect in our #love of Jesus Christ through #music!

So,\n\nTake off those dark sunglasses,\nLook up and let the light in,\nYou\u2019ll see that there\u2019s so much to love.\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd it\u2019s a celebration,\nLeave your worries behind.\nThis is an invitation\nTo celebrate your life.\nJust look around, just look around\nAnd see what you\u2019ve been given,\nAnd turn your life into more than livin\u2019\nIt\u2019s a celebration,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nCelebrate,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nCelebrate.\n\nJump up to the ceiling,\nYou don\u2019t need a reason,\nTake a moment breathe it in.\nLife is such a blessing,\nShow a little faith, it\u2019s\nTime for chapter two to begin.\n\nTake off those dark sunglasses,\nLook up and let the light in,\nYou\u2019ll see that there\u2019s so much to love.\n\nChorus:\n\nAnd it\u2019s a celebration,\nLeave your worries behind.\nThis is an invitation\nTo celebrate your life\nJust look around, just look around\nAnd see what you\u2019ve been given,\nAnd turn your life into more than livin\u2019\nIt\u2019s a celebration,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nCelebrate,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nCelebrate.\n\nThere\u2019s really one big reason\nWe should be celebrating:\nOur Savior overcame it all.\n\nChorus:\n\nIt\u2019s a celebration,\nLeave your worries behind.\nThis is an invitation\nTo celebrate your life.\nJust look around, just look around\nAnd see what you\u2019ve been given,\nAnd turn your life into more than livin\u2019.\nIt\u2019s a celebration,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nCelebrate,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nCelebrate,\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\nLet\u2019s celebrate tonight.\n\nChapters: \n00:00 -00:09 Intro\n00:10 -00:21 Verse\n00:22 -00:34 Pre-chorus \n00:35 -01:21 Chorus \n01:22 -01:36 Verse\n01:37 -01:49 Pre-chorus \n01:50 -02:34 Chorus\n02:35 -02:50 Verse\n02:51 -03:34 Chorus\n03:35 -03:57 Ending\n\nDON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL! #strivetobe is a place for youth of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints across the globe to gather, share inspirational stories, and connect in our #love of Jesus Christ through #music!

Even through the darkness, I will keep shining.\nOh, \u2019Cause I\u2019m brighter than gold. Hey.\n\u2019Cause He made me that way.\nHe made me that way. Ay ay.\n\nChorus:\nI am eternal.

I am eternal.\n\nI could never lay low. Glowing like a halo,\nI\u2019ma let the world know.\nIt\u2019s all because the one who made me\nCalled me by my name and it changed me.\nLike fire in the freezing cold,\nHe\u2019s the one that put the breath of life into my soul. Yeah.\nMultiply by the reciprocal,\nAnd by my calculations I will live forever it\u2019s a miracle.\n\nChorus:\nI am eternal. I am a child\u2013 I am a child of light.\nMy heart is burning.
