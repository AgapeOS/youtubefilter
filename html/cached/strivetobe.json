I am eternal.\n\nI could never lay low. Glowing like a halo,\nI\u2019ma let the world know.\nIt\u2019s all because the one who made me\nCalled me by my name and it changed me.\nLike fire in the freezing cold,\nHe\u2019s the one that put the breath of life into my soul. Yeah.\nMultiply by the reciprocal,\nAnd by my calculations I will live forever it\u2019s a miracle.\n\nChorus:\nI am eternal. I am a child\u2013 I am a child of light.\nMy heart is burning.
