      "description": "We\u2019ve already learned a bit about substitution reactions in organic chemistry and the two different paths they can follow: SN1 and SN2. In order to better predict the products of a substitution reaction and understand how they work, we need to be able to figure out which mechanism a reaction is likely to follow. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll deepen our knowledge of substitution reactions by looking at factors like substrate structure and reaction conditions to determine whether SN1 or SN2 is the more likely mechanism.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nBrookes, P., Lawley, P.D. \u201cThe Reaction of Mono-and Di-Functional Alkylating Agents with Nucleic Acids,\u201d , Biochem.

      "description": "Today, we\u2019re going to visit Siberia and take a closer look at how temperatures there (and around the globe) impact the way cultures, communities, and landscapes form. Air temperature plays a much bigger role than just helping us decide what we\u2019re going to wear everyday, it dictates the kind of foods we can grow, how we build our cities and roads, and the kinds of industries that can even exist in a location. And in a region like Siberia, where it can get cold, like REALLY COLD, the air temperature has had an incredible impact on life. But before we end this episode we\u2019ll warm up with a visit to Phoenix, Arizona to talk about how they too have to make a lot of decisions due to the extreme heat of a city in the middle of the desert. \n\nSources\nBryant, R.H. 1990.

      "description": "If you compare precipitation around the world with population distribution we can understand a simple but powerful pattern of human geography: where there is water, there are people. But it gets a little more complicated because where there are people and limited resources, there is often conflict and bigger geographical questions at stake. So today, we\u2019re going to zoom in and look more closely at how precipitation patterns around the Great Plains and the western United States has led to many conflicts involving the use and distribution of water resources.  \n\n***\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "Today we\u2019re going to talk about two types of cyclones: mid-latitude cyclones and tropical cyclones. Mid-latitude cyclones are huge weather systems that bring day-to-day weather in the mid-latitudes. They're the reason the weather is often unpredictable. We'll focus on the Northern Hemisphere and how these cyclones form along the polar front. Then, we'll shift to tropical cyclones also called hurricanes or typhoons - those smaller spinning vortices of air usually originating in the tropics that can cause widespread damage to coastal communities. We'll talk about the Bhola cyclone, which as of 2021 is the deadliest tropical cyclone in history, and we'll take a closer look at the Sundarbans in the low-lying coastal areas of Bangladesh and India to see how mangroves play a crucial role as a natural ecological barrier to these storms. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

But before we get there we\u2019ll need to introduce you to zoology more broadly, tell you about taxonomy (the branch of science dedicated to naming and describing organisms), and then we\u2019ll get to phylogenetics (which looks at traits, evolutionary history, and relationships among living things). And it\u2019s here that we\u2019ll finally close in on an answer: Animals eat, move, sexually reproduce, and are multicellular. Well, most of the time.

      "description": "If you were given a chemical and told to identify it, how would you go about doing that? You could look at different factors like color, boiling point, melting point, or smell, but the answer still might not be clear. Thankfully, today we have a more precise, higher-tech way of identifying chemicals called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, or NMR. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll look at how NMR allows us to visualize a molecule as a spectrum, and what the peaks on the spectrum tell us about the structure of the molecule.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nMahdi, J.

For more information and a trial, go to\u00a0http://ow.ly/zREQ30rDCDz. \nPicture an \u201canimal\u201d in your mind right now. What does it look like? A dog? A lion? Maybe a sloth, pangolin,\u00a0naked mole-rat, or even just a human? There\u2019s a good chance that you imagined a mammal, which is understandable since we are mammals after all, but there is so much more animal life out there! Today, we\u2019re going to try to figure out what that \u201caverage\u201d animal would really look like - its size, what it eats, how many legs it has, if it even has a head, if it flies or walks or swims, you get the idea. And what we\u2019ll find might just surprise you, or maybe not, they\u2019re pretty common after all! But what we\u2019ll also discover along the way is that what we think of as average is based on what we KNOW and there is so much animal life still to be identified. So maybe if you\u2019re watching this in five years after you\u2019ve identified a ton of new nematode species our answer will be totally different! \n\n\ud83e\udd94\ud83d\udc12\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc00\ud83d\udc20 \ud83d\udc22\ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udc05\ud83e\udd93\ud83e\udd87\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83e\udeb1\ud83e\udd91 \ud83e\udd80\ud83d\udc0a\n\nLearn more about Rae here! https://www.raewynngrant.com\u200b \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

We\u2019ll discuss the main driving forces of climate change in the past and show you how what\u2019s happening now is unlike anything in the past. Global warming, or when there is an increase in the average surface temperature of the planet, has been well-documented since the Industrial Revolution, and scientists have concluded that there is a 95% probability that human activities like burning fossil fuels, industrialization, modern agriculture, and deforestation have caused most of this most recent warming. And while individual actions do matter in helping to curb the disastrous implications of a warming planet, it\u2019s also up to us to hold corporations and governments responsible for the policies and the large-scale emissions that play a disproportionate role in impacting our atmosphere and climate.  \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "Have you ever wondered why the gas station has \u201cunleaded fuel\u201d but there isn\u2019t a \u201cleaded\u201d option? The answer has to do with a chemical called tetraethyl lead, which is an organometallic compound, or an organic compound with a carbon-metal bond. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll learn all about organometallic compounds, including what they are and what kind of reactions we see them in. But beware! This class of compounds may be super useful, but also has a dark side.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nLowe, D., 2009. Things I Won't Work With: Straight Dimethyl Zinc. [online] In the Pipeline.

      "description": "Slave codes were a method of protecting the investment of white enslavers in the Colonies by restricting the lives of enslaved people in almost every imaginable way. The codes restricted enslaved people\u2019s ability to move around, or engage in commerce that could make them financially independent - they restricted the opportunities that would allow them to live with even relative freedom.

Sexual reproduction is part of the very definition of what it means to be an animal and as you'll see life has found a variety of methods to pass down genetic information. We'll also discuss the differences between sex and gender, take a closer look at sex determination systems, examine how same-sex behavior happens all across the animal kingdom, and live a day-in-the-life of the serially hermaphroditic clownfish!\n\n\ud83e\udd94\ud83d\udc12\ud83d\udc1d\ud83d\udc1b\ud83d\udc18\ud83d\udc0d\ud83d\udc00\ud83d\udc20 \ud83d\udc22\ud83d\udc0b\ud83d\udc05\ud83e\udd93\ud83e\udd87\ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udc1c\ud83e\udeb1\ud83e\udd91 \ud83e\udd80\ud83d\udc0a\n\nLearn more about Rae here! https://www.raewynngrant.com\u200b\u200b \n\n***\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

There were also times when that resistance took on larger, more dramatic forms, like with slave uprisings and rebellions. Today, we'll learn about the Stono Rebellion, which was an uprising led by enslaved people in South Carolina in 1784. We'll also talk about ways that enslaved people resisted in general and methods like enforced illiteracy used by those who sought to keep people in bondage.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\n\nSources and References\nIra Berlin, Many Thousands Gone: The First Two Centuries of Slavery in North America (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 1998.\nWinthrop Jordan, White Over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro, 1550-1812 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, reprinted in 2012)\nPeter Wood, Black Majority: Negroes in Colonial South Carolina from 1670 through the Stono Rebellion (New York: W.W.

Soils are the foundation of life on Earth, from the local ecosystems of plants and animals to the crops we grow and food we eat, so it is up to us to care for it as we decide how to manage our land and resources.  \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "What do the smells of feet, armpits, vomit, and goats all have in common? (Besides being super gross\u2026) Carboxylic acids! Despite being responsible for some of our least favorite odors, carboxylic acids are also super useful in organic chemistry.

The Declaration of Independence even opens with the idea that \"all men are created equal.\" But it turns out, the war wasn't being fought on behalf of \"all men.\" The war was mainly about freedom for white colonists, and liberty, justice, and the pursuit of happiness didn't apply to the Black people living in the British colonies. During the war, Black people took up arms on both sides of the conflict, and today we're going to learn how and why they participated.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nSources and References\n\nSylvia R.

      "description": "Today we're going to tell the story of a quiet revolution in the 1960s that shifted our entire understanding of how the Earth works. We currently believe that the Earth's broken outer shell rises from the mantle and folds back in - kind of like a dance of creative destruction and reconstruction - giving us our continents and oceans, mountains and valleys, volcanoes, and earthquakes. And it would take a group of scientists all over the world to get us this grand unifying theory of plate tectonics. \n\nSOURCES\nPetersen, et al 2011. Fundamentals of Physical Geography.

The clause required that people who escaped slavery be returned to their enslavers. In parts of the US that didn't want slavery, the clause sometimes went unenforced. Today we'll learn about how Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Law of 1793 to enforce that clause, how enslavers throughout the country used that rule, and the long-term effects of this law.\n\nSOURCES:\nSomerset v.

We'll focus on the Zambezi River in Southeast Africa following its main features from the tributaries that feed into it in the upper course, to the deafening wonder that is Mosi-oa-Tunya waterfall (also called as Victoria Falls) in the middle course, all the way to the delta as the river flows into the Indian Ocean. Along the way, we'll teach you all about why rivers meander, why some rivers have rapids and others are calm, and how we talk about classify and river systems more broadly. \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "Things have been getting more and more complicated here in Crash Course Organic Chemistry, and as we deal with more complex molecules, parts of molecules we don\u2019t want to react will start reacting along with the parts that we do. Luckily, we have protecting groups, which act like a chemical disguise and help us control how molecules react. In this episode, we\u2019ll look at what makes a good protecting group, as well as identify some good protecting groups for different functional groups. We\u2019ll also see what role protecting groups play in the synthesis of penicillin!\n\nSeries Penicillin References:\nNicolaou, K. C., & Sorensen, E. J. (1996).

      "description": "Cotton is everywhere in our modern world, and it became a hugely important crop in the 19th century United States.  Cotton was a huge economic boon to the US, and much of that wealth was built on the backs of enslaved laborers. And cotton didn't only benefit the states where slavery was legal. While cotton was mainly grown in the southern states, much of that cotton was processed in northern textile mills. Today we'll learn about the growth of the cotton industry, who benefitted from it, and who was left out.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\n-Edward E.

In the more than 150 years since the end of the Civil War, there have been many attempts to litigate the reasons for the war, but the reality is that the root of the division was slavery. As such, Black Americans experience in that war is particularly interesting. Today, we'll learn about how Black people fought and participated in the war, the Emancipation Proclamation, and lots more.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nSources and References\n\n-Deborah Gray White, Mia Bay, and Waldo E.

      "description": "The United States Constitution is not a very detailed document. It lays out the basic structure of government, and the details are filled in with legislation and clarified and reinforced by court decisions. One of the most consequential Supreme Court decisions was the 1896 case of Plessy v Ferguson, which set the precedent that segregating people by race was acceptable. This meant that every public accommodation had the right to refuse to serve Black Americans and that even public institutions like schools could be segregated. While the decision did stipulate that the segregated accommodations be \"separate but equal,\" the equal part of that equation was often left out.  \n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/obituaries/homer-plessy-overlooked-black-history-month.html\nhttp://projects.leadr.msu.edu/makingmodernus/exhibits/show/plessy-v--ferguson-1896/louisiana-separate-car-act--18\nRe-Writing Race in Early American New Orleans, Nathalie Dessens - https://journals.openedition.org/miranda/2296\nJames C.

      "description": "While we can\u2019t explore every cultural trait in the world, language is an important system of spoken, signed, or written symbols humans use to express themselves. It\u2019s a major marker of identity that often unites members of the same nation, or people with similar cultural identity. \nAnd it\u2019s a cultural trait that has enormous power because language helps other cultural traits move through the spoken, visual, tactile, and musical word. So today, we\u2019re going to explore how words move, because the activities that prompt that movement can tell us a lot about how ideas as well move around the world.  \n\nSOURCES\n\nGregory, Derek, Ron Johnston, Geraldine Pratt, Michael Watts, and Sarah Whatmore, eds. 2009.

The Silk Roads are responsible for everything from the spices we use when we cook to the cloth we see as beautiful, but today we\u2019re going to focus on religion, and show how these routes influenced the beliefs of billions of people through time and space. \n\nSOURCES\n\nGeneral:\nGregory, Derek, Ron Johnston, Geraldine Pratt, Michael Watts, and Sarah Whatmore, eds. 2009.

By 1970, 52% of Black Americans remained in the South. People moved away for many reasons, including increased opportunity in the more industrial North and West. They sought a relatively safer life away from the lynchings and violence that were concentrated in the South. This Great Migration shaped 20th-century America in countless ways, but we're going to try to count some of them in this video. \n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\nhttps://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/georgia-voting-restrictions-bill-03-25-21/index.html\nDavarian Baldwin, Chicago\u2019s New Negroes: Modernity, the Great Migration, and Urban Black Life (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2007).\nIsabel Wilkerson, The Warmth of Other Suns: The Epic Story of America\u2019s Great Migration (New York: Random House, 2010). \nhttps://www.britannica.com/topic/sharecropping\nThe Origins of Southern Sharecropping, Edward Royce, 1993\n\n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "Today we\u2019re going to talk about borders. Borders can bring people together, evoke passion and war, divide, conquer, and solidify power. We\u2019re going to focus on the tyranny of the map which is what happens when those in power draw boundaries in ways that conflict with how people in that place want to be grouped. We\u2019ll look at the repercussions of the Berlin Conference of 1884 on boundaries within Africa, take a closer look at continued political unrest in Mali, and look at how this can even happen at a local level like when gerrymandering occurs within a US state. \n\n[Sources]\n\nIn general\nCIA Factbook: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/one_page_summaries.html\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

So far we\u2019ve learned some important lab techniques that organic chemists might use day to day, like chromatography and proton NMR, but there are even more to learn. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry, we\u2019ll introduce some new lab techniques such as distillation and recrystallization and apply them to everything we\u2019ve been learning about EAS reactions. And we\u2019ll do some synthesis problems! \n\nEpisode Sources:\nGilbert, J. C., & Martin, S. F. (2015). Experimental organic chemistry: a miniscale & microscale approach.

Plus we\u2019ll learn what UV spectroscopy can show us about conjugated molecules.\n\nEpisode Sources:\nSemba, R.D., 2012. On the \u2018discovery\u2019 of vitamin A.

When we look at a map, the shapes we\u2019re seeing can seem so permanent, but a map is just a snapshot of the Earth at a particular time, and by looking a countries shape (and how it has changed across time) we can learn so much about how power moves and the ebb and flow of conflict. We\u2019ll talk about the different types of borders, and power dynamics at play in Armenia and Azerbaijan and even look to the oceans as we explore conflict in the South China Sea. \n\nSOURCES\n\nGeneral\n\nCIA Factbook: https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/docs/one_page_summaries.html\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

This damage occurs through a type of organic reaction called a pericyclic reaction.

      "description": "From 1932 to 1972, the United States Public Health Service and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention operated an extremely unethical medical experiment on the effects of outcomes of untreated syphilis. Hundreds of poor Black men from Macon County, Alabama were enrolled in the study, and treatment for syphilis was withheld from them. Even after antibiotics became available that could cure syphilis, these men were left to suffer from the disease and expose their families to syphilis as well. Today we're learning about the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment,  a shameful example of racism in American medicine, and a tragedy that still impacts how many Black Americans think about healthcare today.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\n\u25cf   Susan Reverby, Examining Tuskegee: The Infamous Syphilis Study and Its Legacy (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2009).\n\u25cf   Susan Reverby ed., Tuskegee\u2019s Truth\u2019s: Rethinking the Tuskegee Syphilis Study (Chapel Hill, N.C.: University of North Carolina Press, 2000).\n\u25cf   Harriet A.

      "description": "Empire, imperialism, and colonialism are all interrelated tactics of geopolitics that are used to achieve similar goals of one state maintaining economic, political, or even cultural dominance over other territories. Today, we\u2019re going to unravel the impacts of colonialism at different times throughout history from Taiwan to Myanmar as we examine the longstanding impacts of these relationships. We\u2019ll also take a look at how some countries today, like Thailand, have taken the control of the narrative through culinary colonization. \n\nSOURCES\n\nGeneral:\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

      "description": "The March on Washington of 1963 is an enduring and widely-known event of the Civil Rights movement. But the March has its roots in an earlier planned March on Washington that didn't happen. In 1941, labor leader A. Philip Randolph began planning a gathering aimed at many of the same goals as the eventual 1963 March. Today we'll learn about Randolph, Bayard Rustin, the march they planned, and the movement it inspired. We'll also talk about how the dream of the 1941 march was ultimately deferred for more than 20 years.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nSources and References\nCornelius Bynum, A.

Development is often associated with economic success \u2014 that is countries with higher standards of living and material wealth like those found in Europe and North America. But as we\u2019ll see, this perspective is only one way to compare countries on the global stage, has strong ties to colonialist histories, and doesn\u2019t necessarily capture a place\u2019s environmental and socioeconomic sustainability or even the population\u2019s general happiness. We\u2019ll focus on the region in the Middle East and North Africa, called MENA, and examine how the histories of the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon have resulted in drastically different development scores. \n\n[Sources]\nGeneral\nGetis, Bjelland, and Getis.

      "description": "In 1955, the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that public schools should be racially integrated, and overturned the separate but equal doctrine established in Plessy v Ferguson decades before. This was made possible by a concerted legal effort spearheaded by the NAACP. Beginning in the 1930s, the NAACP's legal defense fund (led by Thurgood Marshall at the time of the Brown Decision) pursued a strategy of bringing cases to court that would expand the civil rights of Black Americans. This multi-decade effort culminated in the Brown decision, with many other victories along the way.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/a/3859/9780316492935\n\nVIDEO SOURCES\n\nRachel Devlin, A Girl Stands at the Door: The Generation of Young Women Who Desegregated America's Schools.

We'll focus on the Democratic Republic of the Congo and take a look at how the mining of minerals such as cobalt, has significantly impacted life in this region.\n\nSources\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1YdZ--u297RHCKLEzFI7YxjuxVtweDttWT9Au1MQlV94/edit?usp=sharing \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "Have you ever wondered where cured meats like salami or pepperoni get their bright red color? Of course its from organic chemistry! A chemical called nitric acid gives them that bright color, while also increasing their shelf. It's also involved in some other interesting reactions. In this episode of Crash Course Organic Chemistry we'll see how nitrous acid reacts with primary amines to form diazonium salts, we'll learn about alkyldiazonium salts and aryldiazonium salts, and see what conditions are necessary for nucleophilic aromatic substitutions.\n\nSeries Sources:\nBrown, W.

Then, we'll take a closer look at colonial port cities, the development of industrial zones and financial districts, and the patchwork of immigrant communities that often developed around them in cities such as Boston in the United States. And finally, we will end our episode with a look at the layout of some North African cities that are in earthquake-prone areas with hot and dry climates such as in Fez, Morocco.    \n\nSOURCES\nKnox and Marston 2016: Human Geography Place and Regions in a Global Context. 7th Edition.

      "description": "Today we\u2019re going to talk about urban planning \u2014 which is the design and regulation of space within urban areas. Urban planning helps weave together economic, social, and environmental goals within a region from work, to play, and living, and unsurprisingly, has a tremendous influence on people\u2019s lives! So today, we\u2019re going to discuss some models we\u2019ve used to describe existing cities such as the Latin American Model, take a look at a planned city and the capital of Brazil, Bras\u00edlia, and look at the impacts of the US highway system and redlining on minority Americans starting in the 1960s. \n\n#CrashCourse #Geography #UrbanGeography\n\nSOURCES\n\nPlanning History\nhttps://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/chicago-fire-1871-and-great-rebuilding/\nLatin America/Brazil\nhttps://worldgeo.pressbooks.com/chapter/middle-and-south-america/\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Latin-American-City-Model-according-to-Ford-1996_fig1_305433398\nhttps://www.researchgate.net/figure/Model-of-Latin-American-urban-structural-development-Source-Borsdorf-Baehr-and_fig1_281024561\nhttps://www.academia.edu/186124/Aztec_City_Planning\nhttps://www.smartcitiesdive.com/ex/sustainablecitiescollective/bright-side-indigenous-urbanization-biodiversity/1043231/\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2017-0010/html\nhttps://whc.unesco.org/en/list/445/lother=es\nhttp://lanic.utexas.edu/project/etext/llilas/vrp/holanda.pdf\nhttps://www.britannica.com/place/Brasilia\nhttps://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-20632277\nhttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170920113346.htm\nhttps://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/opar-2017-0010/html\nhttps://www.academia.edu/186124/Aztec_City_Planning\nhttp://www.public.asu.edu/~mesmith9/1-CompleteSet/MES-SAA-06.pdf\nUrban Renewal/Redlining \nSharma, Madhuri (2018) \"Community Perspectives on Neighborhood Characteristics and Home-Buying Decisions,\" International Journal of Geospatial and Environmental Research: Vol. 5 : No. 1 , Article 3.\u00a0 Available at: https://dc.uwm.edu/ijger/vol5/iss1/3\u00a0\nhttps://www.cleveland.com/architecture/2017/05/despite_legacy_of_redlining_an.html\nhttps://www.ideastream.org/news/redlining-racism-still-hurt-property-values-and-in-turn-school-funding\nhttps://www.clevescene.com/cleveland/what-the-history-of-one-cleveland-neighborhood-can-teach-us-about-race-and-housing-inequality/Content?oid=9031621\nhttps://www.archives.gov/research/african-americans/migrations/great-migration\nhttps://www.nps.gov/CRMJournal/Winter2006/view1.pdf\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_renewal  \nGeneral Sources\nFor a free and open source option for Intro to Human Geography, see: https://humangeography.pressbooks.com/ \nFor a free and open source option for World Regional Geography, see: https://worldgeography.pressbooks.com/front-matter/introduction/ \nCracking the AP Human Geography Exam: 2020 edition.\u00a0 The Princeton Review.\nHobbs, Joseph J.

Today, we're going to discuss industrial geography by tracing the story of the automotive landscape as it formed across the manufacturing belt of the Upper Midwest of the United States, and show how it wasn't just a coincidence that it overlapped with transportation routes and access to raw materials like coal and iron. We'll show you how Least Cost Theory has been used to explain the location of certain industries and how it no longer seems to be holding due to the rise of globalization. \n\nSources: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3fLHL7-J1g_eWAMY9JQ910zEGXDsGTnOgJTdDnl_hg/edit?usp=sharing \n\nWatch our videos and review your learning with the Crash Course App! \nDownload here for Apple Devices: https://apple.co/3d4eyZo\nDownload here for Android Devices: https://bit.ly/2SrDulJ\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

But maybe he isn't that well understood. Like many extremely famous people, Martin Luther King can sometimes be drawn as a bit of a flat character, and his ideas can be reduced to platitudes.

      "description": "In the late 1950s and the early to mid-1960s, a Muslim minister named Malcolm X rose to prominence in the United States during the struggle for Civil Rights. Malcolm X was a member of and spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, and he was a vocal advocate for Black empowerment. His views differed significantly from a lot of the well-known Civil Rights activists of the day, and his views evolved during his ministry. Today, we\u2019ll learn about Malcolm X\u2019s origins, his work with the Nation of Islam, his break from that organization, and his eventual assassination.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/books/how-the-word-is-passed-a-reckoning-with-the-history-of-slavery-across-america/9780316492935 \n\nVIDEO SOURCES\nPeniel E.

      "description": "Welcome to Crash Course Public Health! Over the next 10 episodes, Vanessa Hill unpacks what public health is, who does public health work, and why thinking about it is so important! Public Health is so much more than just washing your hands, adhering to smoking laws, or wearing your seatbelt -- although it is those things too. Broadly, public health is an approach to preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health for everyone. So over the course of this series, we'll show you the many ways the story of your health isn\u2019t just about you, and how it\u2019s about so much other stuff like the social, economic, and environmental conditions that impact all of us. \n\nCheck out our shared playlist with APHA: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDjqc55aK3kywF2dd97_Jh5iP0d2ARhdo \n\nVanessa\u2019s channel: https://www.youtube.com/braincraft  \n\n***\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Jackson began his career working with Martin Luther King in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he founded PUSH, an organization to advance the cause of urban, poor, and predominantly Black communities. Jackson ran for president of the United States in 1984 and 1988, and founded another organization, the Rainbow Coalition.

Over the next 24 episodes, John Green will explore the history and culture of religions and how they offer frameworks for making sense of our lives \u2014 while being incredibly slippery things to pin down. We\u2019ll discover how we define, debate, and contest what religion means, whether we\u2019re personally religious or not. Episode 1 premieres on September 10, 2024.\n\nThis content is based on an introductory university-level curriculum and the input of an advisory board of religious scholars. By the end of this course, you should be able to: \n\n*Use tools and concepts in the study of religion to understand religious practices and worldviews.\n\n*Unpack the history and culture of several major and minoritized religious traditions.\n\n*Analyze inter-religious and intra-religious connections, influences, and frictions.\n\n*Develop an informed historical perspective on contemporary religious issues and debates.\n\n\n***\nSupport us for $5/month on Patreon to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever! https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our Crash Course email list to get the latest news and highlights: https://mailchi.mp/crashcourse/email\nGet our special Crash Course Educators newsletter: http://eepurl.com/iBgMhY\n\nThanks to the following patrons for their generous monthly contributions that help keep Crash Course free for everyone forever:\nEmily Beazley, Brandon Thomas, Forrest Langseth, oranjeez, Rie Ohta, Jack Hart, UwU, Leah H., David Fanska, Andrew Woods, Ken Davidian, Stephen Akuffo, Toni Miles, Steve Segreto, Kyle & Katherine Callahan, Laurel Stevens, Krystle Young, Burt Humburg, Scott Harrison, Mark & Susan Billian, Alan BridgemEmily Beazley, Brandon Thomas, Forrest Langseth, oranjeez, Rie Ohta, Jack Hart, UwU, Leah H., David Fanska, Andrew Woods, Stephen Akuffo, Toni Miles, Steve Segreto, Ken Davidian, Kyle & Katherine Callahan, Laurel Stevens, Krystle Young, Burt Humburg, Scott Harrison, Mark & Susan Billian, Alan Bridgeman, Breanna Bosso, Jennifer Killen, Sarah & Nathan Catchings, Jon Allen, Bernardo Garza, team dorsey, Trevin Beattie, Eric Koslow, Indija-ka Siriwardena, Jason Rostoker, Ken Penttinen, Siobh\u00e1n, Les Aker, Barrett Nuzum, William McGraw, Vaso , Nathan Taylor, ClareG, Constance Urist, Rizwan Kassim, Alex Hackman, kelsey warren, Katie Dean, Stephen McCandless, Wai Jack Sin, Ian Dundore, Caleb Weeks\n__\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecrashcourse/\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",
