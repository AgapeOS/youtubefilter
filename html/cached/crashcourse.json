His views differed significantly from a lot of the well-known Civil Rights activists of the day, and his views evolved during his ministry.

Over the next 10 episodes, Vanessa Hill unpacks what public health is, who does public health work, and why thinking about it is so important!

Broadly, public health is an approach to preventing disease, prolonging life, and promoting health for everyone.

Jackson began his career working with Martin Luther King in the 1960s, and in the 1970s he founded PUSH, an organization to advance the cause of urban, poor, and predominantly Black communities. Jackson ran for president of the United States in 1984 and 1988, and founded another organization, the Rainbow Coalition. Jackson has worked for decades for the cause of Civil Rights and his long career has served as a bridge from the work of the 1960s to the movement for Black lives today.\n\nClint's book, How the Word is Passed is available now! https://bookshop.org/books/how-the-word-is-passed-a-reckoning-with-the-history-of-slavery-across-america/9780316492935 \n\nSources:\nMarshall Frady, Jesse: The Life and Pilgrimage of Jesse Jackson (New York: Random House, 1996).\nErnest R.

Over the next 12 episodes, we\u2019re going to take a look at the ways climate change is affecting our planet, untangle the evolving energy landscape, and learn to think critically about how we, as individuals and as a society, can affect the outcomes. Navigating the politics of climate science is challenging, and such a daunting global issue can feel overwhelming. But there is hope! We\u2019re going to help you understand some of the solutions we can employ to help decarbonize our energy sources and address global climate issues. \n\n***\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

      "description": "Welcome to Crash Course Religions! Over the next 24 episodes, John Green will explore the history and culture of religions and how they offer frameworks for making sense of our lives \u2014 while being incredibly slippery things to pin down. We\u2019ll discover how we define, debate, and contest what religion means, whether we\u2019re personally religious or not. Episode 1 premieres on September 10, 2024.\n\nThis content is based on an introductory university-level curriculum and the input of an advisory board of religious scholars. By the end of this course, you should be able to: \n\n*Use tools and concepts in the study of religion to understand religious practices and worldviews.\n\n*Unpack the history and culture of several major and minoritized religious traditions.\n\n*Analyze inter-religious and intra-religious connections, influences, and frictions.\n\n*Develop an informed historical perspective on contemporary religious issues and debates.\n\n\n***\nSupport us for $5/month on Patreon to keep Crash Course free for everyone forever! https://www.patreon.com/crashcourse\nOr support us directly: https://complexly.com/support\nJoin our Crash Course email list to get the latest news and highlights: https://mailchi.mp/crashcourse/email\nGet our special Crash Course Educators newsletter: http://eepurl.com/iBgMhY\n\nThanks to the following patrons for their generous monthly contributions that help keep Crash Course free for everyone forever:\nEmily Beazley, Brandon Thomas, Forrest Langseth, oranjeez, Rie Ohta, Jack Hart, UwU, Leah H., David Fanska, Andrew Woods, Ken Davidian, Stephen Akuffo, Toni Miles, Steve Segreto, Kyle & Katherine Callahan, Laurel Stevens, Krystle Young, Burt Humburg, Scott Harrison, Mark & Susan Billian, Alan BridgemEmily Beazley, Brandon Thomas, Forrest Langseth, oranjeez, Rie Ohta, Jack Hart, UwU, Leah H., David Fanska, Andrew Woods, Stephen Akuffo, Toni Miles, Steve Segreto, Ken Davidian, Kyle & Katherine Callahan, Laurel Stevens, Krystle Young, Burt Humburg, Scott Harrison, Mark & Susan Billian, Alan Bridgeman, Breanna Bosso, Jennifer Killen, Sarah & Nathan Catchings, Jon Allen, Bernardo Garza, team dorsey, Trevin Beattie, Eric Koslow, Indija-ka Siriwardena, Jason Rostoker, Ken Penttinen, Siobh\u00e1n, Les Aker, Barrett Nuzum, William McGraw, Vaso , Nathan Taylor, ClareG, Constance Urist, Rizwan Kassim, Alex Hackman, kelsey warren, Katie Dean, Stephen McCandless, Wai Jack Sin, Ian Dundore, Caleb Weeks\n__\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/thecrashcourse/\nFacebook - http://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/TheCrashCourse\n\nCC Kids: http://www.youtube.com/crashcoursekids",
