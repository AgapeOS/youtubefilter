Mothers can make us feel loved and safe all year long, but their strength has been keenly felt during the past year of change and uncertainty. \n\nIn 2020, Melissa and her daughters, Sydney and Sienna, wanted to collaborate on a very special message to send love and thanks to moms everywhere. Sydney voiced and sang in this animation, with lyrics written by her sister, Sienna. The trio used Wonder Media Story Maker\u00ae to create their sing-along video.\n\nLyrics:\n\nWake up, her face helps me start the day, \nTellin\u2019 me it\u2019s all gonna be okay,\nIt\u2019s my turn to give so much thanks today,  \nShe\u2019s my rock, my friend,  \nAnd we have a bond that is meant to last,   \nSo let\u2019s all dance... for the moms we love!  \n \nCome home, she greets me with a smile,  \nShowin\u2019 me her love will last awhile, \nIt\u2019s her words, her hugs, her sense of style,  \nShe\u2019s my rock, my friend,  \nAnd we have a bond that is meant to last,   \nSo let\u2019s all dance... for the moms we love! \nFor the moms we love... \nWe love you \u2018til the end! \n  \nHappy Mother\u2019s Day.

She draws a comparison, likening a bird's fear of cats to how humans would feel encountering a tiger. While acknowledging that cats make wonderful pets, Brooke highlights their predatory nature, which can endanger bird populations. She also points out the risk of cats contracting diseases from wild birds. To address these issues, Brooke suggests alternatives like training cats to walk on leashes or building catios.

      "description": "For more bird science videos, visit our website: https://www.wondergrovelearn.net/birds\n\nIn this fascinating episode of \"A WonderGrove For Birds\", Brooke explains how windows can be dangerous for birds, as millions of birds are injured or killed each year by flying into them. Since birds have eyes on the sides of their heads, their vision differs from humans, and they often mistake reflections of the sky or trees in windows for open space. To prevent this, Brooke suggests adding decals, stickers, or patterns to break up reflections, closing curtains or blinds, and placing bird feeders either very close or far from windows. Additionally, hanging moving objects like ribbons can help warn birds. These simple actions can make windows safer for birds.\n\nThis environmental science lesson was inspired by Nature\u2019s Best Hope, Young Readers\u2019 Edition (https://www.amazon.com/Natures-Best-Hope-Young-Readers/dp/1643262149) by Douglas W.
