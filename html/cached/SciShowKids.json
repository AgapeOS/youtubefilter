Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air. Plants also have different parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) that help them survive and grow (1-LS1-1).\nLS1.D: Information Processing - Animals have body parts that capture and convey different kinds of information needed for growth and survival. Animals respond to these inputs with behaviors that help them survive.

Now, animals that live in caves are pretty special. Since caves are really dark, the animals that live there can't use eyes to see where they are going, so they have to find other ways to learn about their environment and navigate their underground homes!\n\nFirst Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Ideas:\n\nLS1.A: Structure and Function - All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air. Plants also have different parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) that help them survive and grow (1-LS1-1). \n\nLS1.D: Information Processing - Animals have body parts that capture and convey different kinds of information needed for growth and survival. Animals respond to these inputs with behaviors that help them survive. Plants also respond to some external inputs (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans - There are many different kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places on land and in water (2-LS4-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n2-LS4-1. Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n----------\nLove SciShow Kids and want to help support it?

      "description": "Teachers and parents: scroll down to check out the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for this episode!\n\nPlatypuses are so funny, it looks like someone made them up as a joke. But they're real animals! Join Jessi and Squeaks to learn about how amazing platypuses really are!\n\nHosted by: Jessi Knudsen Casta\u00f1eda (she/her/they/them)\n\nFirst Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS1.A: Structure and Function - All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans - There are many different kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places on land and in water (2-LS4-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n2-LS4-1. Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n----------\nLove SciShow Kids and want to help support it?

Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS2.A: Interdependent Relationships in Ecosystems - Plants depend on water and light to grow (2-LS2-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n2-LS2-1.

      "description": "Squeaks and Jessi discover an animal with a head that reminds them of a boomerang. Its name is Diplocaulus, and they'll learn all about how that funny head helped it live a very long time ago!\n\nHosted by: Jessi Knudsen Casta\u00f1eda (she/her/they/them)\n\nTeachers and parents: scroll down to check out the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for this episode!\n\nFirst Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS1.A: Structure and Function - All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1.

Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans - There are many different kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places on land and in water. (2-LS4-1)\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n2-LS4-1 Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Ideas:\n\nPS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter - Different kinds of matter exist and many of them can be either solid or liquid, depending on temperature. Matter can be described and classified by its observable properties. (2-PS1-1). \n\nPS1.B: Chemical Reactions - Heating or cooling a substance may cause changes that can be observed. Sometimes these changes are reversible, and sometimes they are not (2-PS1-4).\n\nPerformance Expectations:\n\n2-PS1-1. Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n\n2-PS1-4. Construct an argument with evidence that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed and some cannot.\n\nThird Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nPS2.A: Forces and Motion - Each force acts on one particular object and has both strength and a direction. Forces that do not sum to zero can cause changes in the object\u2019s speed or direction of motion (3-PS2-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n3-PS2-1 Plan and conduct an investigation to provide evidence of the effects of balanced and unbalanced forces on the motion of an object\n----\nLove SciShow Kids and want to help support it?

These representations are useful in communicating ideas for a problem\u2019s solutions to other people (K-2-ETS1-2).\n\nPerformance Expectations:\n\nK-2-ETS1-1 Ask questions, make observations, and gather information about a situation people want to change to define a simple problem that can be solved through the development of a new or improved object or tool.\n\nK-2-ETS1-2 Develop a simple sketch, drawing, or physical model to illustrate how the shape of an object helps it function as needed to solve a given problem\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Ideas:\n\nPS1.A: Structure and Properties of Matter - Different kinds of matter exist and many of them can be either solid or liquid, depending on temperature. Matter can be described and classified by its observable properties. (2-PS1-1). \n\nPS1.B: Chemical Reactions - Heating or cooling a substance may cause changes that can be observed. Sometimes these changes are reversible, and sometimes they are not (2-PS1-4).\n\nPerformance Expectations:\n\n2-PS1-1. Plan and conduct an investigation to describe and classify different kinds of materials by their observable properties.\n\n2-PS1-4. Construct an argument with evidence that some changes caused by heating or cooling can be reversed and some cannot.\n----------\nLove SciShow Kids and want to help support it?

      "description": "The oceans around Antarctica are cold, but full of life. Join Jessi and Squeaks to learn about the blubber of seals, the amazing antifreeze blood of fish, and the shrinking skills of krill.\n\nHosted by: Jessi Knudsen Casta\u00f1eda (she/her/they/them)\n\nTeachers and parents: scroll down to check out the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for this episode!\n\nFirst Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS1.A: Structure and Function - All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Ideas:\n\nLS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans - There are many different kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places on land and in water (2-LS4-1).\n\nESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth\u2019s Surface Processes - Water is found in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds. Water exists as solid ice and in liquid form (2-ESS2-3).\n\nPerformance Expectations:\n\n2-LS4-1. Make observations of plants and animals to compare the diversity of life in different habitats.\n\n2-ESS2-3 Obtain information to identify where water is found on Earth and that it can be solid or liquid.\n\n----------\nLove SciShow Kids and want to help support it?
