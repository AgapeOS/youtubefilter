      "description": "Squeaks and Jessi are learning all about the animals that live at the bottom of the world, including penguins - emperor penguins, macaroni penguins, and more! We learn why penguins look like they're all dressed up, and what kind of food penguins eat.\n\nHosted by: Jessi Knudsen Casta\u00f1eda (she/her/they/them)\n\nTeachers and parents: scroll down to check out the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for this episode!\n\nFirst Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Idea:\n\nLS1.A: Structure and Function - All organisms have external parts. Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air (1-LS1-1).\n\nPerformance Expectation:\n\n1-LS1-1. Use materials to design a solution to a human problem by mimicking how plants and/or animals use their external parts to help them survive, grow, and meet their needs.\n\nSecond Grade Next Generation Science Standards\n\nDisciplinary Core Ideas:\n\nLS4.D: Biodiversity and Humans - There are many different kinds of living things in any area, and they exist in different places on land and in water (2-LS4-1).\n\nESS2.C: The Roles of Water in Earth\u2019s Surface Processes - Water is found in the ocean, rivers, lakes, and ponds. Water exists as solid ice and in liquid form (2-ESS2-3).\n\nPerformance Expectations:\n\n2-LS4-1.

Different animals use their body parts in different ways to see, hear, grasp objects, protect themselves, move from place to place, and seek, find, and take in food, water and air. Plants also have different parts (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits) that help them survive and grow. (1-LS1-1)\nPlants and animals have both internal and external structures that serve various functions in growth, survival, behavior, and reproduction. (4-LS1-1)\nDifferent sense receptors are specialized for particular kinds of information, which may be then processed by the animal\u2019s brain.
