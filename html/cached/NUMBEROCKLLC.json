Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath.\n\nMultiples of Six Song History:\nIn the neon-lit heart of KidzVibe Night Club, just a few meters beyond the monkey bars,   DJ Six-Tables used to spin magic... well he did until it was time for the 2nd and 3rd Grade party-goers to head to bed at 8 O'clock. His turntables twisted out secrets of sixes for all the kids to lear, multiples radiated through the air like they tend to do in that environment. We've all been there and we know how it feels.\n\nThe kids danced in those times, and boy did they ever dance.  They danced like there was no school tomorrow - and probably because there WAS no school tomorrow.  It was Arbor Day, and that town loved its trees even more than Clay Aiken, beloved former American idol Winner, so everybody got the day off - and the proceeding day as well.  \n\nIn those days of unrestricted freedom, you could hear a chant emerge as far away as Numberock St.  6! 12! 18! 24!  Laughter would erupt as DJ Six-Tables dropped a beat, only to catch the audience off guard with a math joke, \u201cWhy did the number 6 feel sad? And the answer? Because 7, ate, 9!\u201d The room erupted, theories of humor have been debated for centuries, but that joke would eventually force humor scientists to reevaluate everything they had ever known.  The kids understood, and that was all that mattered.\n\nAnd in that kaleidoscope of giggles, math became cool again. DJ Six Tables will remain a legend! He was the ultimate remix in human form: part educator, part musical maestro, and 100% soul.",

So we decided to put his theory to the test by inviting him over and it ended up turning into this Angles Video. \n\nSpeaking of angles - isn't that the whole point of the video?! - to teach kids about different types of angles and how to measure them?  I'm not really sure anymore.\n\nRegarding angles, we'll make sure to ask the important questions, like:  \n\nWhich type of angle is the cutest? \nI think right angles, personally. They try to act all perfect and 90, but who is buying that?!\n\nOK, Quick Update: Apparently that question is supposed to be a joke, and that the answer should be, \"A CUTE ANGLE\".  I give this joke a single HA. How many HA's do you give it?\n\nAnd, which angle looks like the antlers on the head of a FULL-GROWN moose?! \nWell, clearly that would be the obtuse angle.  We prove this with absolute certainty if you watch the actual video.  It's probably the last time we'll have a moose in a video.  You wouldn't believe what it costs to rent a moose for an hour these days.\n\nNow let's return back to watching the video so we can discover our own personal answers to these questions.  And all kidding aside, it's time to put on your serious face on now.  And let's learn a thing or two, shall we?!",

What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 3rd Grade and 5th Grade.  This video also targets standards in the UK from KS4 (Year 4-6).\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.\n\n2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOur telling time to the nearest 5 minutes video is aligned with the following Common Core standards:\n\n4.MD (Solve problems involving measurement and conversions of measurements from a larger unit to a smaller unit.)\n\n5.MD (Convert like measurement units within a given measurement system.)",

I'm not sure how well it worked because the hair movements of our main female character was a bit awkward, don't you think?

The Women and Men of Measurement are here to save the day - that is - if your day consists of any unmet emergency measurement needs! \n\nNow, granted, they don't really have any superhero-like superpowers, and two out of five of them still can't seem to stop biting their nails out of habit (looking at you Conard) but they will will always show up 24 hours a day with a ruler in hand, and they will measure basically everything you have with absolute precision!  \n\nWe're still in the process of getting these superheroes upgraded to The Metric System, but they are actually pretty stuck in their ways, especially Red-Eye Ruby.

It seemed like a divine message, but then I looked up and saw it was just some rando guy with a spike and too much hair gel passing by on a gigantic cruise ship that we somehow didn't notice before.  We cut that part out of the video.\n\nBut honestly, he was right.  We just weren't giving any of our newfound wealth to THAT guy. Yet charity was a great idea!  So we gave half of the jackpot to charity and got serious karma points as well as a sense of purpose.\n\nBut hold up, we didn't just give it all away! The remaining stash? We split it up three ways.  And you know what, the thing I remember most fondly wasn't the fact that I become instantly rich, but that I was able to multiply fractions (in this case, 1/2 and 1/3) with my friends to figure out how much of the original treasure we were each gonna get. The money we made was just a bonus, to be honest.",

Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath.\n\nVideo Summary:\n\u201c3-D shapes! You know, those colorful things that make you feel like a three-dimensional kid again. Let\u2019s explore a few of them, as seen in the video above, and address the burning question: Do these shapes serve any purpose, or can we simply banish them from our lives altogether?\u201d \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udd0d\n\nCylinders: Picture it: you\u2019re sipping your fizzy drink, and there it is\u2014a cylinder, just hanging out, being all cylindrical. Two circular bases, congruent and parallel faces. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u201cHey, I\u2019m practical! Store your soup or your soda in me!\u201d \ud83e\udd6b\ud83e\udd64\n\nCones: You spot these bad boys in construction zones, right next to the orange cones that scream, \u201cI was born this way!\u201d But wait, there\u2019s more! Cones can be cream holders. \ud83c\udf66\ud83d\udea7 Wherever you see a circular base which has points that meet at the tippy-top, just like a party hat, you pretty much know what you have to deal with that that point. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u201cI\u2019m versatile! I can hold traffic or sprinkles!\u201d \ud83c\udf89\n\nPyramids: Ancient Aztecs and Egyptians were basically the original architects. They whipped up pyramids like it was a Tuesday afternoon.\ud83d\udd3a Mayans joined the party too and built a few! These babies have a polygon base (think triangles, squares, or pentagons) and triangular faces that meet in once place. There are many theories about why pyramids were built, but I most Egyptologists now believe that they just wanted to make a really cool 3D Shapes video but forgot to invent cameras.\n\nPrisms: Rectangular prisms? They\u2019re like rooms or the box my cute little Cabbage Patch Doll I named \"Pink Baby Hardhead Rosie\" was delivered in. Triangular prisms? Doghouse roof vibes, for real. Basically, any polygon with edges joining at the vertices can be a prism. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying, \u201cYou don't knoooow me! I can be what I wanna be!\u201d \n\nSpheres: These are the rock stars of the 3-D world. No base, no boundaries\u2014just pure roundness. Planets? Yep, they\u2019re perfectly round spheres. You guessed it\u2014sphere! Spheres are basically nature's way of saying, \"My spheres are bigger than your spheres.\"\ud83c\udf0e\ud83c\udfb1\n\nSo there you have it, folks. 3-D shapes: the unsung heroes of geometry. They\u2019re not just math; they\u2019re life. Next time you see a soda can, give it a nod, then check to see if it loaded with high fructose corn syrup. Gotta watch those sugar levels, sphere-iously.",

Against the backdrop of the sea, he plants his new crops, all while demonstrating how to multiply two-digit by two-digit numbers using the area model. This approach, also known as Partial Products Multiplication, provides a geometric perspective that deepens our understanding of multiplication mechanics.\n\nFarmer Maslow, a lover of Reggae music, green beans, and mathematics, has found the perfect blend in his profession. His coastal patch of land near the sea offers him a comfortable life. While he rarely breaks into a full dance routine, he often sways to the rhythm, feet firmly planted\u2014a fitting reflection of his grounded nature.\n\nWe asked Farmer Maslow to pause from his farm work and share a brief explanation of how the area model impacts his daily life. Here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cThe area model is akin to laying out a grid for your multiplication problem. Each cell in the grid represents a partial product.  \n\nSo, let's say you want to multiply 23 by 45, you can just break it down into smaller chunks.  In this example those smaller chunks will be 20 \u00d7 40, 20 \u00d7 5, then 3 \u00d7 40, and finally 3 \u00d7 5. \n\nNow,  just, add up these more simple partial products to arrive at the final answer! \ud83c\udf1f \n\nYou know, nn my farm, I don\u2019t need none of 'dem fancy chemicals or fertilizers to grow the freshest green beans this side of Kingston - nope - just a notepad, a sturdy pen, and a bit of good luck from the weather. Now, I\u2019m off to gaze at the ocean while swaying  gently from side to side. Lata, mon. Mi Gaan.\u201d\n\nThanks  Farmer M!  And as for where he lives? Five points if you guessed it:  Hint: The way he signed up holds the clue.\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf0a\n\nLastly, a heartfelt thank you to our viewers and to Farmer Maslow for contributing to this delightful Area Model Multiplication Song. Until the next song, keep rocking those math skills!",

Their mission? To decode an ancient treasure map that led to a secret cave mysteriously named \"Super Lady\". The catch? The secret location of the treasure was hidden on a map full of coordinates plotted on the coordinate plane, devoid of any additional clues.\n\nJamal, sporting his trusty headband, and Lily, armed with his-and-hers mini-geography handbooks tucked away in her boots, trudged through the jungle. The air smelled of freshly sharpened pencils\u2014the ones they had carved from trees\u2014and carried a faint hope of extra credit.\n\n\u201cJamal,\u201d panted Lily, \u201care we lost?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot even a little bit,\u201d replied Jamal, squinting at Lily\u2019s map. \u201cJust a little more. We\u2019re so close, I can taste (9,4).\"\n\nTheir coordinates led them to a cave\u2014a cave so eerie that its opening bore fangs. Inside, Jamal\u2019s torchlight flickered, revealing equations etched into the walls. Jamal nudged Lily. \u201cBehold! The x-axis and y-axis!\u201d It was the most beautiful coordinate system they had ever seen.\n\nAnd there, the story pretty much ends. Jamal and Lily didn\u2019t mind that the treasure chest held no gold; the mathematical knowledge they gained from their adventure was the true reward. Besides, they were more than content with the vintage phones and years\u2019 worth of classic Super Lady comic books they discovered.\n\nLastly, a heartfelt thank you to our viewers and to Jamal and Lily for contributing to this whimsical Coordinate Plane Song. We\u2019ll see you in the next video. Until then, keep rocking those math skills!",

But this wasn\u2019t the Godzilla you\u2019ve seen in movies\u2014this one had a peculiar obsession: unsimplified fractions!\n\nYou see, Godzilla\u2019s scales were heavy with the weight of countless fractions that hadn\u2019t yet been converted into simplest form. Each day, he patrolled the murky waters, chasing submarines that carried these burdened calculations. Their hulls were etched with shattered numerators and denominators, like battle scars from forgotten math wars.\n\nThe submarines darted through the briny underwater stew, their propellers churning. Inside, wide-eyed crew members clung to their calculators, desperate to simplify the fractions before Godzilla caught up. \u201cReduce! Reduce!\u201d they whispered, dividing numerators and denominators by the same value. The goal: to make those fractions as light as a feather.\n\nBut was there hope on land? Oh yes! On the shores, numbers catapulted skyward. They shattered sacrificially into fragments for the betterment of fractions and all of fraction-kind \u2014 like fragile shards of previously larger unsimplified  numbers. Reduced, yes, but not defeated! For even in their simplest forms, while carried the scars of division, the echoes of lost wholes, they were happy.\n\nAnd the children? They watched from cliffs, their eyes wide. They saw the surreal dance of numbers, the battle between Godzilla and the submarines. It was like a math-themed blockbuster movie, with fractions flying toward and over them like fireworks.\n\nAnd in their final simplest form, those fractions whispered a universal truth: We\u2019re all part of something bigger, like pieces of a grand puzzle.\n\nSo next time you see a simplest-form fraction, remember what they had to go through to become one. And know that even in the scariest of moments, there\u2019s hope\u2014a new beginning waiting to unfold.\n\nAnd never forget that in order to simplify a fraction into simplest form, one needs to divide the numerator (the top number) and the denominator (the bottom number) by the same value until they can no longer be divided into a whole number. \n\nThank you for watching our Simplest Form Song: Simplifying Fractions and learning with us.",

Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath.\n\nVideo History Lesson:\nNothing says \u201cadventure\u201d like plotting points on a graph.  Well, at least when there is treasure on the line,  it's actually not so bad.  At least that is what our two friends, Jamal and Lily, found out in the video you're watching now.\n\nSo basically this whole thing started when Lily was like \u201cWell, we are stuck on this deserted island and don't even know how we got here, let\u2019s try and follow these coordinates!\u201d And Jamal sarcastically quipped, \u201cGreat, just what I wanted to do with my day off\u2014math homework.\"  Lily was like, \"Jamal. Hold up.  It's a lot better than dying here on this deserted beach without any good reading material like retired issues of Super Lady magazine to keep us entertained.\" Jamal, being an avid reader of dated back-issues of Super Lazy magazine was thus convinced that Lily was right.  Her reasoning was tighter than a squirrel's grip on a stolen acorn. Enough, said,  Jamal though, It was coordinate plane time, baby. Do or die!\n\nThe two traipsed off into the heart of the jungle, swatting mosquitoes, and finally stumbled into this cave-like underground thing with fangs bore at the entrance.  It would have been terrifying if Lily and Jamal weren't such historical enthusiasts of macabre elements of style. Classic vampire vibes. Nice touch, nature.  \n\nBut the smell inside was another story altogether.  It was something almost impossible to describe.  They couldn't quite place what it smelled like, but explorers of the ancient past have recorded that it smelled like American Cheese cooked slowly melting away on a sun-beaten truck tire - which to me just sounds like the way your average cave is gonna smell.  But hey, at least they had torches! \n\nAnyway, that was pretty much the whole story other than them uncovering an ancient treasure that had been buried for thousands of years but still inexplicably contained smartphones from 1997 and a bunch of Super Lady magazines.  It was really anticlimactic, to be honest.  Actually, wait, that's not exactly the whole story.  My main point is that everybody learned a ton about ordered pairs and how to graph coordinate points with both positive and negative numbers.  \n\nJamal went on to design video game worlds armed with his newfound knowledge of graphing and Lily retired at age 13 because there was a super-rare Super Lady magazine edition that was worth over a million dollars.  \n\nBelieve it or not, she didn't even sell it. She'd just rent it out for $2,000 a month to Instagrammers who thought it would make them look cool.  Now that's smart!\n\nThank you for watching our Coordinate Plane Song and learning with us.

Convert Percents back into Decimals, too!\n\nAfter reinspection of the video, it appears our protagonist fisherman ended up taking a ride on a fish rather than getting back in his boat.  It was also very considerate of the seagull to find and then return his hat.  I guess there ARE some good seagulls left in the world, after all. \n\nThank you for watching our Converting Decimals to Percents Song.",

      "description": "If you liked the video, you'll love our other fun worksheets, activities, and quizzes that go along with the video at https://learnmore.numberock.com/free-pv/.\n\nQ.Why is it important that students learn about Place Value?\nA. Learning about Place Value helps us understanding the meaning of each digit in a multi-digit number. Being able to bundle up 10 ones, because of the luxury of a tens place, allows us to express numbers like 10 and above efficiently without having to create a new digit for each number. Simply stated, place value helps us make sense of increasingly large (and small) numbers while saving time and energy communicating these values to one another.\n\nCan you imagine having to use 100 different symbols to express values from one to one-hundred? Can you imagine not having an easy way of telling if somebody just gave you $500 or $5,000? Without the current base-10 place value system, our modern lives would be most confusing to say the least!\n\nQ. What grade levels does this video target?\nA. Kindergarten, 1st, 2nd & 3rd Grade | KS1\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years. It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.\n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime. The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!\n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process. As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time. Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs. Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\nWe have a fun variety of Place Value Song-themed teaching resources. Learn more at https://learnmore.numberock.com/pv/.\n\nLearning Standards Alignment:\nCommon Core:\n1.NBT.B.2 | 1.NBT.2\nUnderstand that the two digits of a two-digit number represent amounts of tens and ones. Understand the following as special cases:\n2.NBT.A.1 | 2.NBT.1\nUnderstand that the three digits of a three-digit number represent amounts of hundreds, tens, and ones; e.g., 706 equals 7 hundreds, 0 tens, and 6 ones. Understand the following as special cases...\n4.NBT.A.1 | 4.NBT.1\nRecognize that in a multi-digit whole number, a digit in one place represents ten times what it represents in the place to its right. For example, recognize that 700 \u00f7 70 = 10 by applying concepts of place value and division.\n\nTEKS | Texas:\n1.2E\nUse place value to compare whole numbers up to 120 using comparative language.\n2.2A\nThe student is expected to ruse concrete and pictorial models to compose and decompose numbers up to 1,200 in more than one way as a sum of so many thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones.\n3.2B\nThe student is expected to describe the mathematical relationships found in the base-10 place value system through the hundred thousands place.",

Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath.\n\nVideo Summary:\nYou've made even though you probably never were sure that you had been invited! Actually, you definitely weren't invited, but we're still so happy to have you join us.  \n\nSo now you find yourself at time-traveling dinner party!\ud83c\udf89 But where exactly are you? You're at the end of a quiet country road in New York set way back in 1925. There's plenty to see here, decorative lights, cobblestone paths, and maybe even Jay Gatsby himself. \n\nBut what\u2019s the theme of this party? Drumroll, please\u2026 multiples of nine! We'll be counting:\n\nNumber Shaped Balloons: Up in the sky, colorful balloons float like giant jellybeans. Each balloon represents a group of nine. \n\nFireflies: These little bugs are like living lanterns. They blink on and off, creating a secret code. And guess what? Their dance moves follow the same pattern as the balloons! They go 9, 18, 27, just like our friends in the sky.\n\nDecorative Lights: Picture twinkling fairy lights strung up in front of a mansion. They\u2019re like tiny stars that guide us. And guess what? Yep, they\u2019re grouped in nines too! They light up in a magical sequence: 9, 18, 27, and beyond.\n\nNow, why is all this important? Well, it helps us understand something called multiplication. When we multiply, we\u2019re basically adding groups of the same number. So when we say \u201c9 times 2,\u201d we\u2019re really saying \u201ctwo groups of 9.\u201d That\u2019s 18! \ud83c\udf88\n\nAnd here\u2019s the best part: We\u2019re not just learning math; we\u2019re dancing through time! So put on your imaginary dancing shoes, my friend, and let\u2019s waltz with the nines. \ud83d\udd7a\ud83d\udcab\n\nThank you for watching our 9 Times Tables Song and learning with us.",

Why is it important for me to learn how to compare and/or order decimals?\nA. If you've ever gone to a store and see a list of prices for competing products, it will be really hard to make a judgement call if you can't tell which price is the cheapest.  \n\nIf you're a football scout comparing the time of the best athletes, you'll want to instantly be able to compare 40 yard dash times as the players complete their combine.  These times are almost always expressed to the nearest 100th of a second, in order to put together a full profile of the player you are scouting. \n\nTo effectively take part in our economy, it's also necessary to be able to understand fractional parts of %'s of ownership, often expressed in decimals, when it comes to understanding how much of a company you own.   \n\nDid you know just .001% of Apple Computers is worth about $10,000,000?  Decimal places can sure make a lot of cents!  The examples of understanding decimals values in the real world are almost endless!\n\nQ. What grade levels do this video target?\nA. 4th Grade & 5th Grade.  However reinforcement of this concept may continue all the way up until 6th grade.   \n\n \u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\n\nNewly Available for Website Subscribers:\n1. Number Notes | Highly-visual math worksheets that integrate drawing and creative processes that make problem-solving and note-taking way more fun. \n\nResearch has shown that resources like these worksheets help students to integrate their artistic side with the mathematical side of their brain and as a result aides with long-term memory retention.  \n\nOur own research has shown us that teachers who try these activities love them!  It seems to be a natural extension beyond song and video and into additional visual learning tools that when used in concert with our videos, cater to the many different types of learners that in your classroom - especially those non-mathy types.\n\nHope to see you at https://learnmore.numberock.com/free-cdn.",

What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 3rd Grade and 4th Grade.  This video also targets standards in the UK from KS2 (Year 4-5).\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.\n\n2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOur Skip Counting By 4 video is aligned with the following Common Core standards:\n\n3.OA.1 (Multiply and divide within 100.)\n\n3.OA.7 (Use the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems.)",

I'd like to show my students this video but my school blocks YouTube videos.  Where else can I watch this video to work around this problem?\nA. You can watch this video here; ad-free and child-safe:\nhttps://numberock.com/lessons/multiples-of-3/\n\nQ. What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 3rd Grade and 4th Grade.  This video also targets standards in the UK from KS2 (Year 4-5).\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nA. We have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over on our website at numberock.com.\n(see clickable link at the top of this YouTube description).  \n\nThere, you can access our complete library of learning resources which can be accessed free for a full month (and you can cancel anytime).  At the end of the month you'll have the opportunity to lock in a price of  $4.95/month or $49.95/year for as long as the subscription remains active.\n\nPremium members gain immediate access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments with grade-book recording + individual student performance reports, printable games, and more.  \n\nOur library of resources is growing and getting continually better.\n\nComing Soon For Subscribers:\n1. Number Notes | We're currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! \ud83c\udf4e\n\nOur Skip Counting By 3 video is aligned with the following Common Core  standards:\n\n3.OA.1 (Multiply and divide within 100.)\n\n3.OA.7 (Use the four operations with whole numbers to solve problems.)",

Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath. \ud83c\udf4e\n\nThank you for watching our US Presidents Song For Kids.\n\n \u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nThis Presidents of the USA song for kids Starts from George Washington and goes all the way to Barack Obama and Donald Trump. With some bluegrass music in the background, it'll be hard not to start tapping your feet to the jig as you memorize all 45 US Presidents from first to last.  \n\nWhat better way to learn about all the presidents of the United States than by a song which makes it easy to remember them in chronological order?\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n1. Self-Graded Assessments | These will soon be available for every Common Core and TEKS standard from 2nd-6th Grade so you'll be able to track and monitor student progress while your students complete standards-aligned quizzes that are integrated with the NUMBEROCK video they just watched.\n\n2. Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\n\ud83c\udf4e Hope to see you at https://numberock.com! \ud83c\udf4e",

Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath.\n\n \u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\n\nHere is a neat little trick to help you master the 12 times table. \n\u00bb\u00bb is 10\u00d7 plus 2\u00d7\nExample: 12\u00d74 = 40+8 = 48\n\nQ. I'd like to show my students this video but my school blocks YouTube videos.  Where else can I watch this video to work around this problem?\nA. You can watch this video here; ad-free and child-safe:\nhttps://numberock.com/lessons/the-multiples-of-12/\n\nQ. What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in 3rd Grade and 4th Grade.  This video also targets standards in the UK from KS2 (Year 4-5).\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nA. Make sure to check out our additional teaching resources over on our website at numberock.com.\n(see clickable link at the top of this YouTube description).  \n\nOnce there, you can access our complete library of learning resources which can be accessed free for a full month (and you can cancel anytime).

You can watch this video here; ad-free and child-safe:\nhttps://numberock.com/lessons/symmetry/\n\nQ. What is a symmetry?\nA. Symmetry is when a shape or object has two completely identical sides that are either facing each other or are around an axis. A line of symmetry is the line that divides the two identical parts, each part being a mirror reflection of the other.\n\nQ. What grade levels does our Symmetry Land Song For Kids target?\nA. 4th grade (But applicable for standards from 2nd grade to 5th grade)  Because of the song's theme, we think kids in Kindergarten and 1st grade would also be positively engaged by the song.  Appropriate for UK students in KS1 and KS2.\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nA. Make sure to check out our additional teaching resources over on our website at numberock.com.\n(see clickable link at the top of this YouTube description).  \n\nOnce there, you can access our complete library of learning resources which can be accessed free for a full month (and you can cancel anytime).

The student is also expected to identify line-symmetric figures and draw lines of symmetry.\n\nI CAN STATEMENT: I can identify a symmetrical figure and draw lines across them so that when they are folded along those lines, the two halves will perfectly overlap.\n\nTEKS Standards\n4.6B\nThe student is expected to identify and draw one or more lines of symmetry, if they exist, for a two-dimensional figure.\n\nI CAN STATEMENT: I can identify and draw the lines of symmetry of two-dimensional shapes.",

The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.

Our library of lesson materials is not only super-affordable but is also FREE to try out at http://numberock.com/letsrockmath.\n\nVideo: Count to 20 Number Song for Kids | Counting 1-20 Fun Song for Children\nGrade Levels: Pre-K / Preschool, Kindergarten, & 1st Grade\n\nFollow Lindsey and her cousin Benji as they go on a picnic and see all sorts interested animals representing the numbers 1 to 20. They count to 20 to find out how many dancing ducks there are, whistling fish, and even maestro bunnies jamming away on the upright bass as they sing, counting from 1-20 with all their new human and animal friends.\n\nQ. What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in Pre-K, kindergarten, and 1st Grade.  \n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.  Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\n\nA. Make sure to check out our additional teaching resources over on our website at numberock.com.\n(see clickable link at the top of this YouTube description).  \n\nOnce there, you can access our complete library of learning resources which can be accessed free for a full month (and you can cancel anytime).  At the end of the month you'll have the opportunity to lock in a price of  $4.95/month or $49.95/year for as long as the subscription remains active.\n\nPremium members gain immediate access to a wide variety of video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments with grade-book recording + individual student performance reports, printable games, and more.  \n\nWe have additional teaching resources that are always expanding over at https://www.numberock.com.  For the low price of $4.95/month, premium members gain access to video-aligned activities like worksheets, printable posters/anchor charts, task cards, self-graded assessments, games, and more.  \n\nComing Soon:\n\n1.  Number Notes | Were currently working on creating exercises where students will be able to take notes artistically on printable templates featuring characters from the videos.  \n\nResearch has shown that this will help to integrate their artistic side side of the student's brain with the mathematical side of their brain which helps with long-term memory retention.  Our own research has shown us that teacher's who use start using these templates love them!  It seems to be a natural fit as we move beyond our unique auditory learning tools into visual learning tools, that when used in concert, cater to the different types of learners that you teach everyday.\n\nHope to see you at https://numberock.com!\n\nOur Counting to 20 Song for Kids video is aligned with the following Common Core standards:\n\nCCSS K.CC.3\nWrite numbers from 0 to 20. Represent a number of objects with a written numeral 0-20 (with 0 representing a count of no objects).\n\nCCSS. K.CC.4a\nWhen counting objects, say the number names in the standard order, pairing each object with one and only one number name and each number name with one and only one object.\n\n\nCCSS K.CC.4b\nUnderstand that the last number name said tells the number of objects counted. The number of objects is the same regardless of their arrangement or the order in which they were counted.\n\n\nCCSS.K.CC.4c\nUnderstand that each successive number name refers to a quantity that is one larger.\n\n\nCCSS.Math.Content.K.CC.5\nCount to answer \"how many?\" questions about as many as 20 things arranged in a line, a rectangular array, or a circle, or as many as 10 things in a scattered configuration; given a number from 1-20, count out that many objects.",

Discover more ad-free videos and fun video-aligned lesson extenders at https://numberock.com.\n\nAbout the Song:\nThis song helps students master important 7th Grade math standards by introducing the concept of letters in algebraic expressions, ie Algebra.  Students during their elementary education most often deal in expressions that have specific numeric values, but as they develop their mathematical skills beyond elementary, they'll soon discover that many expressions and equations have letters called variables in place of a specific number. \n\nThese letters stand in for an unknown numeric value that and represent a range of potential values.  Since these values are unknown, mathematicians have decided that letters, like \"x\" and \"y\" for example, make great substitutes for numbers when we have incomplete information.\n\nAdditionally, students watching the song will be taught how to identify parts of expressions with mathematical terms.  Some of these terms are sums, products, factors, quotients, coefficients and more.",

Mientras hace su tarea m\u00e1s tarde en la noche, Benny se atasca en un problema sobre trazar una fracci\u00f3n en una recta num\u00e9rica que es mayor que uno, por lo que le env\u00eda un mensaje de texto a Thania para obtener ayuda.\n\nLetras:\nLe pregunt\u00e9 a mi mejor amiga \u00c9rica\nD\u00f3nde va un medio en la recta num\u00e9rica.\nElla dijo: \"Primero dibuja la recta\".\nLuego me cant\u00f3 una canci\u00f3n perfecta.\n\nDe cero a uno es el todo que se dividir\u00e1.\nEl denominador dice en cu\u00e1ntas partes lo har\u00e1.\nSalta desde cero hasta la primera marca,\nY un medio es lo que encuentras cuando llegas all\u00e1.\n\nMi peluche no habla, pero lo o\u00ed preguntar:\n\"Oye, Ben, en la recta, \u00bfun tercio d\u00f3nde va?\"\nYo le dije: \u201cPrimero, dibuja la recta.\nLuego canta conmigo esta canci\u00f3n perfecta\u201d.\n\nDe cero a uno es el todo que se dividir\u00e1.\nEl denominador dice en cu\u00e1ntas partes lo har\u00e1.\nSalta desde cero hasta la primera marca,\nY un tercio es lo que encuentras cuando llegas all\u00e1.\n\n\u201c\u00bfQu\u00e9 se hace -pregunt\u00e9 con fervor-\nsi no es uno el numerador?\"\nDijo: \"tratemos de buscar cinco novenos\nen la recta num\u00e9rica lo hallaremos.\nPrimero dividamos en nueve nuestro entero\nLuego da cinco saltos y a cinco novenos llegaremos\".\n\nDe cero a uno es el todo que se dividir\u00e1.\nEl denominador dice en cu\u00e1ntas partes lo har\u00e1.\nSalta desde cero hasta la quinta marca,\nY a cinco novenos lograr\u00e1s llegar.\n\nUsemos la recta para hablar del pastel.\nContemos las cinco rebanadas en \u00e9l.\nCinco son las partes, el denominador, por lo que cinco va debajo en la fracci\u00f3n.\nEsta recta va desde el cero al dos,\nPero la fracci\u00f3n es menor que uno.\nCrea cinco espacios desde cero al uno.\nAhora, el \u00faltimo paso y as\u00ed no me abrumo\nEl numerador uno es mi rebanada.\nEscribo un quinto bajo la primera marca.\nRecuerda este consejo, hazlo muy despacio.\nY no cuentes las l\u00edneas, sino los espacios.\n\nDe cero a uno es el todo que se dividir\u00e1.\nEl denominador dice en cu\u00e1ntas partes lo har\u00e1.\nSalta desde cero hasta la primera marca,\nY un quinto es lo que encuentras cuando llegas all\u00e1.\n\nGracias por aprender sobre fracciones en una recta num\u00e9rica con nosotros.  \nEspero que puedas unirte a nosotros en el pr\u00f3ximo video!\nMuchas Gracias,\nNumberock",

Learning about Place Value helps us understanding the meaning of each digit in a multi-digit number. Being able to bundle up 10 ones, because of the luxury of a tens place, allows us to express numbers like 10 and above efficiently without having to create a new digit for each number. Simply stated, place value helps us make sense of increasingly large (and small) numbers while saving time and energy communicating these values to one another.\n\nCan you imagine having to use 100 different symbols to express values from one to one-hundred? Can you imagine not having an easy way of telling of somebody just gave you $500 or $5,000? Without the current base-10 place value system, our modern lives would be most confusing to say the least!\n\nQ. What grade levels does this video target?\nA. 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade | year 3, year 4\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years. It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.\n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime. The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!\n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process. As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time. Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs. Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\nWe have a fun variety of Place Value Song-themed teaching resources. Learn more at",

      "description": "FREE TRIAL LINK:  \nhttps://learnmore.numberock.com/free-pvr\n\nQ.Why is it important that students learn about Place Value?\nA. Learning about Place Value helps us understanding the meaning of each digit in a multi-digit number. Being able to bundle up 10 ones, because of the luxury of a tens place, allows us to express numbers like 10 and above efficiently without having to create a new digit for each number. Simply stated, place value helps us make sense of increasingly large (and small) numbers while saving time and energy communicating these values to one another.\n\nCan you imagine having to use 100 different symbols to express values from one to one-hundred? Can you imagine not having an easy way of telling of somebody just gave you $500 or $5,000? Without the current base-10 place value system, our modern lives would be most confusing to say the least!\n\nQ. What grade levels does this video target?\nA. 3rd, 4th, and 5th grade | year 3, year 4\n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years. It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.\n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime. The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!\n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process. As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time. Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs. Where can I experience more of what NUMBEROCK has to offer?\nWe have a fun variety of Place Value Song-themed teaching resources. Learn more at",

What grade levels do this video target?\nA. This video targets learning standards in Pre-K, kindergarten, and 1st Grade.  \n\nQ. Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\nQ. I love your songs.

Where did you guys come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, began as a 5th Grade math teacher of 7 years.  It came together after years of experimenting with my lessons trying to figure out the best way to help my students retain the math concepts they were learning.  \n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. I knew I found the secret sauce when not only were my students retaining the concepts longer, they were singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess and at home with their parents during dinnertime.  The songs were so catchy, my students couldn't get the math songs out of their head!  \n\nDuring testing, I often found my students humming the melodies in order to jostle their memory of a rule or problem solving process.  As we've all experienced, there is something about the power of music that allows us to retain information easier and for longer periods of time.  Without getting into the finer details of multi-sensory learning and how it often helps the students who most need the help, the power of a catchy song is hard to deny.\n\n\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\u00bb\u00bb-------------\u00a4-------------\u00ab\u00ab\n\nNewly Available for Website Subscribers:\n1.

      "description": "Earl is back and this time he's got protractors, lots of 'em.  He has an urgent message the public needs to be aware of, and it has to do with drawing and measuring angles, or as he calls it, \"degrees extraction\". \n\nIn order to fully commit to the lesson, Earl's taken a day off from delivering pizza. We'll find him sippin' on organic apple juice boxes with his friend Jay.  They gaze at the clock, but not to tell what time it is. Rather, their focus remains solely on the two hands of the clock which form a 99 degree angle. Earl and his good friend then celebrate their love of protractors which inspired a secret handshake, a symbol of a bond that no-one can break.  \n\nAlso, the moose from the original Angles video makes a reappearance, but if you watch all the way to the very end, you may be just as confused as we are about if the moose is actually making a reappearance, or if appearances aren't always exactly what they seem.\n\nSo wait, has this whole angles video series been some sort of moosed-out fever dream?  Honestly, we have no idea.  That's for you, and you alone, to decide.  \n\nIf you remember, in the last video, we posed the question, \"Which angle looks like the antlers on the head of a full-grown moose?\"  In this video, we ask if our whole universe comes into and out of existence with each resting breath of the Numberock moose.  Our guess?  Probably.",

From puppies riding excavators to dancing ducks, they count along, discovering how many animals they can find. The journey is filled with catchy melodies, fun visuals, and opportunities for kids to sing and count along as they explore numbers 1-10 with their new animal friends!\n\nQ. What grade levels does this video target?\nA. This video is designed for Pre-K, Kindergarten, and 1st Grade learning standards.\n\nQ. Where did Numberock come from?\nA. Numberock is a project that I, Mr. Hehn, started as a 5th Grade math teacher after 7 years in the classroom. It was born out of my desire to create engaging ways for my students to retain and enjoy math.\n\nQ. Does Numberock drive real results in the classroom?\nA. Absolutely! My students began retaining math concepts more effectively, singing the songs outside of the classroom during recess, and even teaching the songs to their families at home. Music became their secret tool for memory recall, especially during testing.\n\nThere\u2019s something undeniable about the power of music\u2014it sticks in your head, and when used to teach math, it helps students grasp and retain concepts in a fun and engaging way. And this method works particularly well for students who might struggle with traditional learning tools.\n\nQ. I love your songs! Where can I find more from Numberock?\n\nA. Check out all that NUMBEROCK has to offer on our website at numberock.com. You can explore our complete library of learning resources for free for an entire month!

      "description": "This Earth Day rap song focuses on educating students on protecting our planet, Earth, emphasizing that it\u2019s our only home. The song covers \"The Three R's\"; reducing, reusing and recycling.\n\nIt suggests practical steps like recycling cans and bottles by sorting them properly and reducing paper use to limit pollution. Opting to walk or bike instead of drive helps lower emissions, while combining errands into one trip conserves fuel. Small actions\u2014such as conserving water, switching to LED lights, or composting\u2014can have a big impact on reducing waste and energy use. The song calls for collective effort, urging us to consider future generations and embrace reducing, reusing, and recycling to ensure Earth\u2019s well-being.\n\nNumberock Could Really Use Your Support:\nDownload lesson materials aligned with video: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Reduce-Reuse-Recycle-Earth-Day-Activities-Bundle-1st-Grade-6th-Grades-2254692\nDownload MP3 song for offline use: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Earth-Day-Rap-Song-Reuse-Reduce-Recycle-MP3-Download-NUMBEROCK-13332843\nDownload MP4 sideo for offline use: https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/Product/Earth-Day-Rap-Music-Video-Reuse-Reduce-Recycle-MP4-Download-NUMBEROCK-13332885\n\n#earthday2025 #earthdaysong #reducereuserecycle #educationalrap",
