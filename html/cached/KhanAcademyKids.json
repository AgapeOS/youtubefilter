      "description": "Join us for a special episode of Circle Time with Caroline and Sophie from Khan Academy Kids. Today, we welcome Teacher Naomi and her son Noah who talk about diversity. Listen as they discuss what it means to be different, and how our physical differences make the world an interesting and beautiful place. \n\nIt can be hard for parents to know how to have these conversations with young children. Teacher Naomi emphasizes that differences do not mean people are better or worse or good or bad. Rather, learning about people and getting to know them can help us build common bonds and friendships. \n\nCaroline and Sophie continue the conversation and talk about how they are similar and different. Kids can think about ways they are similar and different from those in their own lives, along with ways to celebrate that diversity. Take a look at books in Khan Academy Kids with themes around diversity and friendship. Read the book \u201cThe Story Club\u201d by Cynthia Platt. Hear how the Khan Kids friends each write a story in their own way. Finally, see our friends from Show & Tell who have shared artwork from around the world. How are they similar? How are they different? \n\nThis video is the first in a series that explains the values of diversity, race, and justice to young children. Our special guest, Naomi O\u2019Brien, is a teacher, author, mother, and advocate for social justice. Learn more about Naomi at https://readlikearockstarteaching.com/. \n\nThe series is aligned with the guidelines for anti-bias education from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. NAEYC curriculum goals include helping to develop a child\u2019s positive personal identity, empathy towards others, and the awareness of fairness. Stay tuned for more videos in the series that cover the topics of race and justice. \n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your child\u2019s story, too. Send their pictures or drawings to our team at http://khan.co/KhanKids-SubmitYourArt. When we hear more stories, we have more to share and celebrate!\n\nWe\u2019ll be bringing you a new Circle Time every other week.

      "description": "Join us for the second video in our diversity series on Circle Time with Khan Academy Kids. Today, we welcome back Teacher Naomi and her son Noah who help explain the concepts of identity and race. Learn how scientists and society sometimes study and group people based on similarities. Then, listen to the difference between grouping in a good way (to build community) versus grouping in a bad way (racism). Getting to know people, rather than making judgments about skin color, is an important step in building a healthy community. \n\nContinue the conversation with Caroline and Sophie as they talk about similarities and differences, like where they\u2019re from, how they speak, and their family customs and traditions. Then read along to the story \u201cGot to Be Me\u201d by Cynthia Platt. Meet T-Rex the dinosaur who dared to be different. Finally, enjoy a diverse selection of artwork made by friends around the world! \n\nThis video is the second in a series that explains the values of diversity, race, and justice to young children. Our special guest, Naomi O\u2019Brien, is a teacher, author, mother, and advocate for social justice. Learn more about Naomi at https://readlikearockstarteaching.com/. \n\nThe series is aligned with the guidelines for anti-bias education from the National Association for the Education of Young Children. NAEYC curriculum goals include helping to develop a child\u2019s positive personal identity, empathy towards others, and the awareness of fairness. \n\nWe\u2019d love to hear your child\u2019s story.
