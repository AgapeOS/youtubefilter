      "description": "Here is a sample from Rock 'N Learn Telling Time. \n\nIn today's fast-paced world, kids need to know how to tell time quickly and accurately with both digital and traditional (analog) clocks. Now, it's a breeze with the help of Timothy Time, the Clock That Rocks and his comical friends. Cool music, catchy rhymes, and colorful animation entertain kids of all ages. Kids learn to tell time to the hour, half hour, and quarter hour. They practice using AM and PM, counting by fives, telling time to five minutes, and telling time to the exact minute. They also learn about digital clocks, calendars, days of the week, and months of the year. It's about time!\n\n\"I teach 2nd grade at Erickson Elementary School in Tucson, Arizona. I showed your Rock N Learn: Telling Time video to my second graders for the second time today and they absolutely LOVE it! In the ten years that Ive been teaching, I have never seen a better educational video. It is so terrific; it held my interest the whole time! It is so beautifully done and is just great! Not only that, telling time is a very difficult concept for 7-8 year olds to grasp and you not only made it easy, you made it FUN!\"\u2014Kelly Munsell\n\n\"Timothy Time and Kuku bird teach children how to tell time in this rockin production. Snappy music and short segments will hold young viewers attention as they learn how to tell time.\"\u2014Parents Guide to Childrens Media\n\n\"This exciting video presents lessons about the difficult-to-grasp concept of time. Kids will learn how to read clocks and relate telling time to their everyday lives. This is an educationally valuable tool for home learning.\" \u2014ReviewCorner.com",

      "description": "Kids love this song that tells a classic children\u2019s story about three little pigs going out into the world to build their houses and eventually facing the big, bad wolf. What choices do these little pigs make? Here you will find a lively kids\u2019 song that provides the main points of the story and keeps a kid-friendly style appropriate for all ages. Have fun singing along!\n\nThe Three Little Pigs Song Lyrics:\n\nOoo, oh yeah!\n\nThree little pigs built their houses one day.\nThe first little pig built his house out of straw.\nBut he didn\u2019t like it, he didn\u2019t like it\nwhen the wolf came along.\nHe wasn\u2019t happy, he wasn\u2019t happy at all.\n\nLittle pig, little pig, let me in. \nNot by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\nThen I\u2019ll huff and I\u2019ll puff, and I\u2019ll blow your house in.\n\nOooo. Ha ha ha, that\u2019s right, baby! I\u2019m the big bad wolf!\n\nThree little pigs built their houses one day.\nThe second little pig built his house out of sticks.\nBut he didn\u2019t like it, he didn\u2019t like it\nwhen the wolf came along.\nHe was in an awful, he was in an awful fix.\n\nLittle pig, little pig, let me in.\nNot by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\nThen I\u2019ll huff, and I\u2019ll puff, and I\u2019ll blow your house in.\n\nOoo Ha ha!\n\nThree little pigs built their houses one day.\nThe third little pig built his house out of bricks.\nAnd he was ready, he was ready\nwhen the wolf came along,\n\u2018Cause he had not used any straw or sticks.\n\nNo way.\n\nLittle pig, little pig, let me in. \nNot by the hair of my chinny chin chin.\nThen I\u2019ll huff, and I\u2019ll puff, and I\u2019ll blow your house in.\n\nOooo. Ha ha ha.  Hey, wait a minute \nthe house is suppose to fall down. \n\nIt didn\u2019t!\n\nI\u2019m the big bad wolf and I huffed and I puffed. \nBut wait nothing\u2019s happening. \n\nYou silly wolf, you can\u2019t blow down bricks. \n\nOh, you little pigs stop that give me some respect. \nI\u2019m the big bad wolf, now. \n\nYou can\u2019t blow down my brick house.\n\nI\u2019ll blow your house in. I will, I\u2019ll huff and puff. \n\nJust do all you want. Huff and puff. \n\nJust you wait, you\u2019ll see. \n\nBlow yourself blue in the face. You can\u2019t blow down bricks. \n\nYou better watch out. I\u2019m gonna blow your house down. \nI will, just you wait and see. \n\nThis story about the three little pigs and big, bad wolf can be used as a teaching lesson about building your life with a solid foundation. You will be much better prepared to face life\u2019s challenges though careful planning, getting a good education, and developing your skills. Hard work and persistence will pay off. Too often, we don\u2019t teach kids the importance of planning and being prepared for unforeseen adversity. That especially applies to health and finances but other areas as well. Whenever we build a solid foundation using good values and habits, it doesn\u2019t mean our lives will be easy. It means we can better handle tough times and be ready when good opportunities come along. Not only does it help us, but we can better serve and protect the ones we love and care about.\n\nThe straw and sticks represent lazy habits and only living for the moment. They symbolize lacking self-discipline. The story of the three little pigs is a true classic tale that dates back to at least a published version in 1890, but it\u2019s probably much older than that.\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

      "description": "Baby Shark is a fun song for kids to enjoy singing along. Baby Shark, Momma Shark, Daddy Shark, Grandma Shark, and Grandpa Shark swim together. They swim away from a giant squid, swim with a remora, and discover a seahorse. \n\nA remora is a ray-finned fish that attaches itself to the body of other fish to travel in the ocean. Remoras eat leftovers from the skin of sharks and keep the sharks clean.  Sharks and remoras help each other. Although remoras can swim on their own, they do not have a swim bladder and have trouble swimming long distances. So, it\u2019s great when they can attach to a shark or other sea animal.\n\nBaby Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nBaby Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nBaby Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nBaby Shark\n\nMama Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nMama Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nMama Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nMama Shark \n\nDaddy Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nDaddy Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nDaddy Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nDaddy Shark\n\nGrandma Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGrandma Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGrandma Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGrandma Shark\n\nGrandpa Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGrandpa Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGrandpa Shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGrandpa Shark\n\nWow!\nNot a shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nGiant squid do, do, do, do, do, do\nGiant squid do, do, do, do, do, do\nNot a shark\n\nSwim away do, do, do, do, do, do\nSwim away do, do, do, do, do, do\nSwim away do, do, do, do, do, do\nSwim away \n\nWow!\nNot a shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nA remora do, do, do, do, do\nA remora do, do, do, do, do\nNot a shark\n\nSwim with sharks do, do, do, do, do, do\nSwim with sharks do, do, do, do, do, do\nSwim with sharks do, do, do, do, do, do\nSwim with sharks \n\nWow!\nNot a shark do, do, do, do, do, do\nIt\u2019s a seahorse do, do, do, do, do\nIt\u2019s a seahorse do, do, do, do, do\nNot a shark\n\nHappy sharks do, do, do, do, do, do\nHappy sharks do, do, do, do, do, do\nHappy sharks do, do, do, do, do, do\nHappy sharks \n\nBaby shark\n\nThis version features vocal performances by Luci Christian.\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

      "description": "Based on a classic children\u2019s tale, this kids song relates to modern day concerns about how it can feel when someone is different and gets teased or bullied by others. This video with song lyrics can be useful during discussions about bullying and why any teasing or isolating other kids can have serious consequences. It also helps to know that many problems arise when we don\u2019t learn to look for the good in others. It you try to reach out to someone who is being avoided by other kids, you can help them feel accepted, discover new things about them, and feel good being a friend to someone in need. If you are someone being teased, please know that you have many special qualities inside that will get better as you get older. Many kids go through an awkward stage where they feel like they don\u2019t belong. It\u2019s good to have talks with adults willing to listen. Make sure children have the resources they need, including trained counselors if necessary. It\u2019s been over 170 years since Hans Christian Andersen wrote the story, but the message has much relevance today in a society that tends to teach people to value others by how they look. Most people can recall a moment in their lives when they felt like they didn\u2019t measure up to those around them.\n\n\nA mother duck sat on her nest\nwaiting for her eggs to hatch.\nOne egg was rather large in size.\nIt had no other match.\n\n\"Peep, peep,\" said the newborn ducks.\n\"Quack, quack,\" said their mother.\nOne duck was strange, one duck was odd.\nHe didn't look like the others.\n\nHe didn't look like the others.\nHe didn't look like he belonged.\nNobody there seemed to know\nthat he was a beautiful swan.\n\nThe mother took her ducklings to the water.\nOther ducks were staring at him.\nThey said the one duckling was ugly.\nBut my how he could swim!\n\nEach day that passed, the worse it got.\nThe animals teased the ugly one.\nThey pushed and shoved, calling out to him.\nThey never seemed to tire of making fun.\n\n\u2018Cause he didn't look like the others. (the others)  \nHe didn't look like he belonged.\nNobody there seemed to know\nthat he was a beautiful swan.\n\nAt last our friend could stand no more.\nHe decided to run away.\nHe wanted to find a fun, safe place\nwhere he could swim and play.\n\nHe came to a swamp where some wild ducks lived.\nHe chose this for his home\nUntil one day a hunter came,  \nhe knew again that he must roam.\n\nAnd he didn\u2019t look like the others. \nHe didn\u2019t look like he belonged. \nNobody there seemed to know\nthat he was a beautiful swan. \n\nEverywhere our friend would go, \nThe story would seem the same. \nNever welcome anywhere, \nit really was a shame. \n\nUntil one day when he was grown, \nsomething strange occurred. \nOh, whose reflection could that be?\nWho was that beautiful bird?\n\nWell, he didn\u2019t look like the others. \nHe had grown so big and strong.\nEverybody finally knew\nthat he was a beautiful swan. \n\nTry not to judge by how someone looks.\nFind out what\u2019s within.\nA lovely swan may live inside.\nThe beauty\u2019s beneath our skin. \n\nIf you treat others by how they look, \nThat\u2019s not being too smart. \nOh, look inside to find their worth. \nWhat\u2019s important is in the heart. \n\nDon\u2019t you know that everyone is different?\nBut everybody can belong, \nif deep inside us, in our hearts, \nthere lives a beautiful swan. \n\nThere lives a beautiful swan. \nOh, there lives a beautiful swan.\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

      "description": "The Little Red Hen Song is based on a kids folk tale teaching children basic moral values: Be thrifty, take initiative, plan ahead, work hard, be self-reliant, and persevere.\n\nKids also learn about fairness. When the other animals refuse to help grow wheat, make flour, and bake bread they do not get to share the reward of eating the bread. Original music sung in a parody style of gritty 80s rock, this kids tune brings lots of fun while portraying bold lessons about values. It\u2019s as though the song\u2019s raw energy reflects the realistic truths about living a highly successful life.\n\nThe Little Red Hen song lyrics:\n\nThe little red hen found some wheat.\nIf we plant it, we can make a treat.\n\nWho will help me make it grow so high?\nThe duck, the rat, and the pig all said, \u201cNot I!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you will not help me then\nI\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d said the little red hen.\n\nThe wheat grew up and turned yellow.\nIf we cut it, we can make some bread, you know.\n\nWho will help me cut this wheat that\u2019s high?\nThe duck, the rat, and the pig all said, \u201cNot I!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you will not help me then.\nI\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d said the little red hen.\n\nOooo . . . yeah!\n\nOoo, we need the miller to make flour from the wheat\nbefore we can bake a tasty treat.\n\nWho will help me carry this bag that\u2019s tied?\nThe duck, the rat, and the pig all said, \u201cNot I!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you will not help me then.\nI\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d said the little red hen.\n\nWe need to use the flour to make the bread.\nIf you\u2019ll come and help me, we can all be fed.\n\nWho will help me bake the bread tonight?\nThe duck, the rat, and the pig all said, \u201cNot I, no !\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you will not help me then\nI\u2019ll do it myself,\u201d said the little red hen.\n\nThe bread came out so warm and sweet.\nThe duck, rat, and pig came running to eat.\n\nOh no, no... \u201cBecause you would not help then\nI\u2019ll eat it myself,\u201d said the little red hen.\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

      "description": "Jack and the Beanstalk is a favorite classic children\u2019s story. Kids love this energetic tune that parents can use to discuss finding opportunity while exercising restraint when confronted with increasing and dangerous risk. This could apply to many situations in life where people never find happiness or satisfaction no matter what they accomplish. Mostly, this song provides fun kids entertainment.  \n\nJack needed money so that he could buy food.\nHis mother said, \"Jack, go sell the cow.\"\nBut Jack traded for some magic beans instead,\nAnd take a look at what's happened now...\n\n(chorus)\nBeanstalk, beanstalk growin' up so high.\nBeanstalk, beanstalk reachin' to the sky.\nJack climbed the beanstalk,\nAnd much he did find.\nHe climbed that beanstalk three magical times.\n\nNow when Jack first climbed to the giant's house\nHe looked around and what did he see?\nThe giant's gold coins\u2014they caught Jack's eye.\nJack said, \"I want these for me.\"\n\nJack took the gold coins and down he went.\nHe gave them to his mom on the ground.\nHis mother was so pleased with what she saw;\nShe started jumping up and down.\nMother: Oh Jack, this is FANTASTIC!\n\nJack and his mother did enjoy the gold coins.\nThey always had plenty of food,\nBut then one day no more coins were left.\nHis mom said, \"What will we do?\"\n\n(chorus)\nBeanstalk, beanstalk growin' up so high.\nBeanstalk, beanstalk reachin' to the sky.\nJack climbed the beanstalk,\nAnd much he did find.\nHe climbed that beanstalk three magical times.\n\nOn the second climb Jack saw a wonderful hen.\nGold eggs were what that hen could lay.\nJack grabbed the hen and went back down\u2014\nAnother great magical day!\n\nBut Jack was greedy and he wanted more.\nHe wondered what else might be up there.\nGold eggs were great and they paid the rent,\nBut Jack went back without any care.\n\n\n(chorus)\nBeanstalk, beanstalk growin' up so high.\nBeanstalk, beanstalk reachin' to the sky.\nJack climbed the beanstalk,\nAnd much he did find.\nHe climbed that beanstalk three magical times.\n\nThe giant's golden harp was what Jack saw.\nJack felt this was what he must have.\nHe grabbed the golden harp, but the harp cried out,\nAnd awoke the giant up from his nap!\n\nThis time the giant was fast on his feet.\nFerociously he chased after Jack.\nJack was so scared, he ran as fast as he could,\nBut he almost had a heart attack!\n\nThe story as you know turns out okay,\nBut Jack learned all about greed.\nBe happy with the things you have,\nAnd don't ever take more than you need.\n\n(chorus)\nBeanstalk, beanstalk growin' up so high.\nBeanstalk, beanstalk reachin' to the sky.\nJack climbed the beanstalk,\nAnd much he did find.\nHe climbed that beanstalk three magical times.\n\nBeanstalk, beanstalk\nBeanstalk, beanstalk\nJack climbed the beanstalk,\nAnd much he did find.\nHe climbed that beanstalk three magical times.\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

      "description": "This traditional nursery rhyme goes back many years and presents a riddle. The earliest published version is from around 1730. This version was printed around 1825. Kids love discovering that no matter how hard they try to count the people, animals, and sacks, the answer is really quite simple if it\u2019s only the narrator. However, if all were headed to St. Ives, the complex mathematical answer is 2802.  Two males, 7 females, 49 sacks, 343 cats, and 2401 kittens. Most interpretations of this riddle assume the narrator is going the opposite direction from the others, so the answer is only one. He\u2019s the only one actually stated that is going to St. Ives. \n\nAs I was going to St Ives song lyrics: \n\nAs I was going to St. Ives,\nI met a man with seven wives,\nEach wife had seven sacks,\nEach sack had seven cats,\nEach cat had seven kits:\nKits, cats, sacks, and wives,\nHow many were going to St. Ives?\n \nThis modern day version of the song does not have to be about one man having multiple wives. These women could be the man\u2019s daughters; they actually look alike, right? So check this out\u2026 they are all married, different husbands, so that\u2019s why they are all called wives in the song. What do you think?\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

Below are links to each section of this video:\n\n00:00   Rock 'N Learn Title Screen  \n00:05  Find the Sounds\n02:21  Sound it Out\n05:13  Putting it All Together\n08:45  CVC Rhyming Words\n\nThis video begins with two phonics games to encourage kids to join in. Kick off the learning fun by playing along with \u201cFind the Sounds,\u201d a phonics game to practice phonemic segmentation. Then, Chip the Robot zooms in to play \u201cSound it Out\u201d and practice oral blending.\n \nThen, get valuable practice reading Consonant-Vowel-Consonant words with a fun music video for the song \u201cPutting at all Together.\u201d \n\nTo wrap things up, rhyming couplets of Consonant-Vowel-Consonant words make fun phrases to go along with colorful illustrations. Kids will love reading along with Brad and Chip the Robot. \n\nPhonemic segmentation can be used to help with spelling. It takes a word that learners hear and splits it into its sounds. Students then identify the sounds and think of the letters that go with each sound to spell a word.\n\nOral blending uses the reverse process: taking the letters in a word, thinking of the sounds that they make, and blending them together to make a word. Both segmentation and blending are important phonics skills to boost reading skills and spelling ability. \n\nUsing video as part of a lesson can help students retain more information and develop a better understanding of concepts. This video is useful to introduce the concepts of phonemic segmentation and oral blending. It is also great for daily practice. \n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

After a quick review of upper and lowercase letters, young learners practice the most common sound each letter makes. An on-screen mouth shows how to form the sounds.\n\nExcitement builds as kids race the clock to say letter sounds in silly sentences before hearing the answers. Then, learners play several games along with the video to reinforce their understanding of letter-sound associations that will help them read and spell. They practice consonant combinations that include blends. Finally, after learning some common sight words, kids feel successful reading complete sentences and even short stories.\n\nRock 'N Learn Letter Sounds has helped people of all ages learn to speak English. This video is often recommended by teachers who specialize in teaching English Language Learners (ELL). Plus, the \"on-screen mouth\" has been a huge hit with speech therapists. Rock 'N Learn Letter Sounds was developed with speech and language experts to ensure sounds are correctly enunciated.\n\nRock \u2018N Learn has videos for kids of all ages.

Eventually, your child starts speaking along. The captivating mouth on screen is helpful for proper pronunciation.  As young children become ready, they develop proper articulation skills through imitation, often for the first time. \n\nLuci Christian, an award-winning voice actress appearing in dozens of films, uses her talents to get little learners tuned in and talking. Especially useful when you\u2019re concerned your child may not be talking as much as peers. Help ease the frustration of not being able to communicate. \n\nBusy parents appreciate this self-paced approach children can use with minimal assistance. Along with critical phrases to communicate feelings, children learn parts of the body, parts of the face, and family words. Includes more than 65 words and phrases.",

You will see!\n\nSaucer (singing):\nI'm a little saucer, round and flat\nI'm the place where the teacup sat\nSit the teacup on me like a hat\nThen you'll know just where it's at!\n\nOven (singing):\nI'm a little oven, I cook food\nI'd like to... (sing along with you)  Whoa!\n\nTeapot (interrupting):\nHold on! Waaaait a minute. YOU aren't a teapot... or a teacup... or even a saucer. You have nothing to do with tea. We aren't going to sing with you!\n\nOven (crying):\nOh no! I'm sorry... boo hoo hoo...\n\nCup:\nNow Teapot, it's always better to be kind. Everyone is different, and everyone has something special to offer.\n\nTeapot:\nOkay... I'm sorry I was rude. Oven, you can sing too. Show us what you've got!\n\nOven:\nReally! Oh boy! \n\nOven (singing):\nI'm a little oven, I cook food\nI forgive you for being rude\nThis will put you all in a good mood\n[DING! Oven opens to show cookies]\n\nTeapot:  Wow!\n\nOven (singing):\nI baked cookies and they're oh so good!\n\n[Everyone cheers]\n\nTeapot: Thank you, Oven!\n\nOven:  You're welcome!\n\nAll (singing):   \nWe can all be friends as you can see\nWe are as happy as we can be\nI am kind to you; You're kind to me\nLive together in harmony\n\nOven: Hoo hoo!   ...

Desert is done!\n Hurray for pumpkin pie!\n\nOver the river and through the woods,\n To Grandmother's house we go;\n The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh,\n Through white and drifted snow!\n\nOver the river and through the woods,\n Oh, how the wind does blow!\n It stings the toes and bites the nose,\n As over the ground we go.",

If you use our videos to sing and learn English, you\u2019ll appreciate this version with lyrics. Lots of fun. Yes, they all come out to meet her, she sometimes wears red pajamas, and she does have to sleep with grandma. Watch our animated kids do a fun dance that\u2019s easy to learn. This song has been a children\u2019s favorite since at least the 1920s. Prior to that, the melody appeared in some spiritual songs and was eventually adapted by railroad workers during the 1890s.

      "description": "\"I'm a Little Teapot\" full video here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtZYTzzdHa8\n\nHey parents and teachers! Here are some suggestions for using our \"I'm a Little Teapot video at home and in the classroom. This free video is a great resource for remote learning.\n\nWhen working with kids, we are always looking for ways to encourage kindness, right? Kindness at school, kindness among siblings, kindness with friends\u2026\n\nAt Rock 'N Learn, we created a video that's a fun twist on a classic song: I'm a Little Teapot.\n\nOur version of the song has the familiar verse about the teapot, but we go on to introduce a tea cup character... and even a saucer.\n \nThings are going great until... someone a little different comes along. When oven wants to join in, teapot is not happy. She acts a little rude, and hurts oven's feelings. This provides a great opportunity to encourage kindness. \n \nTeacup saves the day by getting teapot to let oven join in. Finally, oven shows how everyone has something to offer. He makes cookies! What a great way to encourage young learners to include everyone.\n \nWe hope you'll enjoy using this video at school and in the home. It's great for launching discussions about being kind to others, even if they are different. Watching again can be a helpful reminder of this concept when needed. The link to the video is on screen and in the description of this video. Thanks for watching, and be sure to subscribe.",

      "description": "Five Little Speckled Frogs is one of the best preschool and kindergarten songs for learning early math concepts, number sense, recognizing numerals, and identifying more or less of a quantity. Preschoolers form a basic understanding of counting up to five and subtracting from five. Give children a head start for when they learn math in school. Toddlers love this song. They giggle as the frogs jump in the water. This version includes lyrics on screen to make it easy for adults to sing along and share this fun learning experience. Pause the video and count with your child. Watch it over and over and notice children\u2019s progress as they count or sing along. You will begin to discover other learning opportunities in everyday life where you can count objects with your child. Adding or removing objects and counting them helps form a basic understanding of addition and subtraction even with very young children. \u201cStudies show that a child\u2019s math skills at kindergarten entry are a better predictor of future academic success than reading skills, social skills, or the ability to focus,\u201d according to the National Association for the Education of Young Children.\n\nFive little speckled frogs \nsat on a speckled log \neating some most delicious bugs.

How are plant and animal cells alike? You might be surprised that there are more similarities than differences. Join Kevin as he transports to the Cellular Learning Center. You will learn that only plant cells have cell walls that are made of cellulose. Both plant and animal cells have a cell membrane surrounding the cell. It allows some things to come in and out of the cell. Both cells have cytoplasm that contains the cytoplasm - the tiny organs of a cell. The nucleus is where all of the genetic material is stored. This genetic material is made of molecules called DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. The nucleus contains all of the information for running the cell and making new cells. Only animal cells have organelles called centrioles which aid in cell division. Both plant and animal cells have ribosomes. You will also learn about golgi bodies, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, vacuoles, chloroplasts (in plant cells), and lysosomes (in animal cells). This is a lot of material that can be useful for a science test. It is designed to be at about a fourth grade level, but may be useful for students at any grade level, even much higher grades. Teachers will find this to be a wonderful introduction and overview for studying plant and animal cells at any grade level.",

      "description": "Kids love learning about the characteristics of arthropods, fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Using a fun game show format, students learn that arthropods have an exoskeleton, segmented bodies, and jointed legs. They are cold-blooded. Fish are vertebrates (have a spine), gills for breathing underwater, and most are covered in scales and have fins. Amphibians begin life with gills and live in the water. Later they develop lungs and live on land. They have moist, hairless skin. Reptiles are vertebrates, lay eggs on land, have scales, and are cold-blooded. Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates. They breathe air and are bipedal (walk on two legs). They also lay hard-shelled eggs. All have feathers, wings, and beaks. Mammals are warm-blooded vertebrates, they breathe air and have hair or fur. Most are born live, not hatched from an egg. The mothers produce milk after birth to feed their offspring. All mammals have three middle-ear bones and a four-chambered heart.\n\nWatch the full free version of our Life Science video here: https://youtu.be/gugUKAzc4O8",

      "description": "Kids enjoy learning about the five senses: sight, taste, smell, hearing, and touch. Join Kevin in the Sensory Learning Center. Have you ever wondered how the five senses work? Here are easy-to-understand explanations of the five senses. The material was developed with educators for fourth grade standardized tests, but it\u2019s also useful for lower and upper grades. Even some advanced preschoolers enjoy watching and learning from it. High-school and college students say it helps them review the five senses. Parents educating their children at home during school closures will get a break from teaching with educational videos from Rock \u2019N Learn. Kids can watch and learn by themselves. Be sure to check out our channel and subscribe at www.youtube.com/rocknlearn. Watch the full free version of our Human Body video here: https://youtu.be/AHQGNb0zBgg.\n\nIn this segment from Rock 'N Learn Human Body, learn how these parts of the eye work together: cornea, pupil, iris, lens, muscles around the eye, vitreous humor. retina, rods, cones, visual cortex of the brain, eyebrows, eyelashes, eyelids, and tears. Discover the four main taste sensations: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter. Some experts add a fifth called umami or savory. Learn how sense of taste depends heavily upon sense of smell and the olfactory epithelium traveling up the olfactory nerve to the olfactory cortex of the brain. Hearing is explained with sound waves, ear canal, middle ear, eardrum (or tympanum.), hammer, anvil, stirrup, cochlea, and cilia. Learn how loud music can destroy cilia which never grow back. Learn how the ears help you keep balance with the semicircular canals. Finally learn about the sense of touch and the common types of receptors found in the skin. What areas of your body are more sensitive?",

There\u2019s some serious learning going on. Look out for the splashdown at the end! \n\nYeah! Let's travel through the alimentary canal and learn about digestion now.\nInto your mouth you put your food. \nYour tongue pushes it back after it is chewed.\nThe epiglottis comes next for us.\nIt helps food go down the esophagus.\nAnd not down the wind pipe!\n\nNext comes the stomach, the food goes in\nand is broken down before the small intestine.\nOoh the blood picks up some nutrients there\nand takes them to the liver to store and share.\n\nThen comes the large intestine for waste accumulation.\nIt takes out more water and gets things ready for defecation!\nWaste moves through the colon getting harder as it flows\ntill finally out of the rectum it goes.\n\nWe developed this a few years ago with Scott Cawthon, creator of the wildly successful Five Nights at Freddy's series. Scott worked for Rock 'N Learn at the time and did all of the animation. At Rock 'N Learn, we're all so proud of the success Scott has enjoyed!",

Eventually, your child starts speaking along. The captivating mouth on screen is helpful for proper pronunciation. As young children become ready, they develop proper articulation skills through imitation, often for the first time. \n\nLuci Christian, an award-winning voice actor appearing in dozens of films, uses her talents to get little learners tuned in and talking. Especially useful when you\u2019re concerned your child may not be talking as much as peers. Help ease the frustration of not being able to communicate. \n\nBusy parents appreciate this self-paced approach children can use with minimal assistance. It teaches critical phrases to communicate their needs. Includes more than 90 words and phrases.",

      "description": "For our newest Multiplication Rap version with animated characters: https://youtu.be/_UVcNBjoxs4\nBut if you are looking for Rock 'N Learn's original Multiplication Rap video, here it is. Maybe you learned your multiplication facts using it, and now you have kids of your own. Or, perhaps you just want a little trip down memory lane. (Or, Multiplication Blvd., laugh.) This was first released on VHS in 1998. We have had so many requests from our fans who want to see this original Rock 'N Learn Multiplication Rap video that millions of kids have used. For some, it brings some fond childhood memories of learning multiplication facts. We are pleased to offer it! This features Brad Caudle, one Rock 'N Learn's two original founders, still actively involved in creating Rock 'N Learn educational entertainment. An interesting side note: Brad has long hair, and when we first video-recorded this back in 1998 his hair was long and flowing. One school system expressed some concern about the role model it presented, so we tied his hair, put on the cap, and redid the video. Not sure if we still have that untamed long-hair version, but it would be fun if we did! Be sure to subscribe to this channel. More Rock 'N Learn classics coming soon! https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn",

      "description": "This animated phonics song helps children learn the sound of the digraph CH in English. A digraph is a combination of two letters representing one sound. Colorful characters teach kids two words at a time with the CH sound. Kids will love singing along and watching the action after each group of two words. As they do, they\u2019ll practice making the ch sound. Developed with speech therapists to form each letter sound correctly. Extra practice reading words with the letter combination CH follows the song.\n\nFor more digraph and trigraph practice:\nck   https://youtu.be/JbFpfKlrhzw\nph and gh   https://youtu.be/IJ0V4peFU4s\nsh   https://youtu.be/vJWKudfRipc\nth   https://youtu.be/TlX5jSEN5sQ\nwh   https://youtu.be/rGOtW405L1o\nshr   https://youtu.be/38zecmUP1Y8\nsqu   https://youtu.be/he5p5nbSXzM\ntch   https://youtu.be/41rarInjzqo\n\nCH Digraph Song lyrics:\n\nThe letters C and H together make the sound:  CH-CH-CH\n\nch - chair  \nch-ch chair \nch - cherry  \nch-ch cherry\nch-ch-ch \n\nch - cheese  \nch-ch cheese\nch - chew\nch-ch chew\nch-ch-ch \n\n\nch - chug \nch-ch chub \nch - choo choo \nch-ch choo choo\nch-ch-ch \n\nch - change  \nch-ch change\nch - chest\nch-ch chest\nch-ch-ch \n\nch - chimp  \nch-ch chimp \nch - chase\nch-ch chase\nch-ch-ch \n\nch - chips  \nch-ch chips \nch - chili \nch-ch chili\nch-ch-ch \n\nch - child  \nch-ch child \nch - chain  \nch-ch chain\nch-ch-ch \n\nThe letters c and h can come at the end of a word.\n\nch - lunch  \nlunch ch-ch \nch - punch\npunch ch-ch \nch-ch-ch \n\nGreat job!

      "description": "What is Multiplication?\nhttps://youtu.be/dPksJHBZs4Q\n\nMultiplication Rap\nhttps://youtu.be/_UVcNBjoxs4\n\nHey parents! Sometimes when we help our kids with homework, we discover that things are being done a little differently than when we went to school. Even simple multiplication has some new methods and techniques. In this video, we'll show you how the Area Method for multiplication works. \n \nConsider the multiplication problem 42 times 6. \n\nThe way I learned to solve this problem is with a technique called the Algorithm method, which you may have just called carrying. \n\nStarting with the ones place, I multiply 6 times 2. The answer is 12. Of course, I can't just write down 12 in the answer. I place the 2 from the ones place here, in line with the other ones place.\n\nThen, I carry the one from the tens place and write it above the 4.\nSix times 4 is 24, plus the one we carried equals 25.\nWe put that here in the answer below.\n\nMy answer is 252. \n\nThat's the old-school tried and true way, but some learners do have trouble with it. \n\nThese days, there's another way for beginners to learn to multiply: the Area Method.\n\nFirst, draw a rectangle, and split it into two parts. We're multiplying by 6, so we'll put a six here on the side.\n\nNow, we need to write the number 42 across the top of our rectangle in expanded notation:  40  \u2026  plus \u2026 2, there! \n\nI'm going to find the \"area\" of each of these rectangles by multiplying length times width.\n\nFirst, 40 times 6. I know that 6 times zero gives us zero for the ones place\u2026 and six times 4 is 24 for the tens place. This part of our rectangle has an area of 240.\n\nThe other one is easy! 6 times 2 gives us 12 for the area of this part.\n\nNow all I need to do is add the areas of the 2 rectangles together.  240 plus 12\u2026 2 plus zero gives us a 2 in the ones place\u2026 4 plus 1 gives us a 5 in the tens place\u2026 and this 2 goes in the hundreds place of the answer. 252 -- that checks out! We got the same answer we did with the good old algorithm method.\n\nNow, I know some of you are wondering\u2026 WHY?! Why can't teachers just do it the way I learned it?\n\nWell, the Area Method of Multiplication provides another way of looking at how multiplication works. When teaching multiplication, it's useful to have different ways of doing things for different levels of learners. Some beginners may find the area method easier when first learning, then move on to multiplication with carrying later. \n\nWe hope this explanation was helpful to you.

      "description": "Santa is up on the housetop, click, click, click. This Rock \u2019N Learn version of Up on the Housetop is a fun Christmas song that kids and adults enjoy. Originally written in 1864, it has been recorded by many famous artists through the years. Santa makes his appearance up on a rooftop and descends down the chimney to visit Kate and Bryce. Now it may seem like Santa brings Bryce better gifts than he brings Kate, but is that really true? First, we don\u2019t actually know everything that is in those Christmas stockings. Second, that could be a really nice RC plane that Kate got from Santa. Or then, perhaps on the Naughty/Nice scale, Bryce actually did much better than Kate this year. What do you think? \n\nUp on the Housetop lyrics:\n\nUp on the housetop reindeer pause\nOut jumps good old Santa Claus\nDown through the chimney with lots of toys\nAll for the good little girls and boys\n \nHo, ho, ho! Who wouldn\u2019t go?\nHo, ho, ho!

      "description": "How do you teach sight words to kids at home or school and for ESL? With this video, kids learn to read, spell, and write 7 high-frequency words with an easy approach that includes letter tracing and word shapes. These sight words are at a preschool and kindergarten level. As the word shape and outline of each sight word appears, learners have a chance to read the word before hearing it. Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by giving us a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and subscribing to our channel which has new videos posted each week. https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn\n\nThe sight words we will be posting each week correspond to Rock \u2019N Learn Preschool Sight Words video with fun, animated characters:  https://youtu.be/wgrtvyu1fOY\n\nMany teachers and parents make this program part of the routine each day to build reading, spelling, and writing skills. It\u2019s perfect for classrooms, both in-person and online. You can adapt the approach to be more challenging for advanced students and easier for new or struggling students. Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRepetition is the key to learning sight words. Use this program at least once a day for several weeks, and you will begin to see progress with all students. Rock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy. When this video becomes part of a daily routine, children actually tend to look forward to it, as they develop foundational skills and feel the pride that comes from learning. \n\nAll Rock \u2019N Learn sight words and phonics videos can be important resources to help a child learn to read. We\u2019ve been helping kids learn for over 30 years using research-based methods developed with classroom teachers who are highly skilled at helping kids learn to read and write, especially children with disabilities and other challenges. Students learning English for the first time at any age or ability level tend to benefit from this sight words video and the other learning resources from Rock \u2019N Learn. Visit https://www.rocknlearn.com for more information. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel and be sure to give our videos a thumbs up.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying that learning sight words is the only strategy for learning to read. Most children, especially those struggling, benefit from explicit phonics instruction presented in a systematic, orderly progression for learning letter-sound correspondences. Here are free and proven videos from Rock \u2019N Learn for learning to read that will help build strong phonics decoding skills:\n\nABC Phonics Song:  https://youtu.be/tKsIi1MH4lw\nLetter Sounds:  https://youtu.be/0wDoUs8hrJM\nPhonics 1:  https://youtu.be/Jam0DCe_bYo\nPhonics 2:  https://youtu.be/plFuEmwVN4o\nPhonics 3:  https://youtu.be/zZ_6dTb0LOQ\nPhonics 4:  https://youtu.be/VQqWs9qIyYU\n\nFor those who prefer DVDs or digital downloads: \nhttps://www.rocknlearn.com\nhttps://www.amazon.com/rocknlearn\n\nRegardless of a child\u2019s IQ or socioeconomic status, Rock \u2019N Learn helps provide the early skills to develop strong reading and writing ability, essential for a child\u2019s success in life.",

      "description": "Here\u2019s an effective way to learn to read, spell and write sight words for kids. It's perfect for ESL, preschool, and kindergarten. Dedicated practice with high frequency words is an important component in helping kids learn to read and spell. Although phonemic awareness is important too, tricky words that don\u2019t follow the rules especially need sight words practice.\n\nWith this video, kids learn to read, spell, and write 7 high-frequency words with an easy approach that includes letter tracing and word shapes. These sight words are at a preschool and kindergarten level. As the word shape and outline of each sight word appears, learners have a chance to read the word before hearing it. Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by giving us a \u201cthumbs up\u201d and subscribing to our channel which has new videos posted each week. https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn\n\nThe sight words we will be posting each week correspond to Rock \u2019N Learn Preschool Sight Words video with fun, animated characters:  https://youtu.be/wgrtvyu1fOY.\n\nMany teachers and parents make this program part of the routine each day to build reading, spelling, and writing skills. It\u2019s great for classrooms, both in-person and online. You can adapt the approach to be more challenging for advanced students and easier for new or struggling students. Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRepetition is the key to learning sight words. Use this program at least once a day for several weeks, and you will begin to see progress with all students. Rock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy. When this video becomes part of a daily routine, children actually tend to look forward to it, as they develop foundational skills and feel the pride that comes from learning. \n\nAll Rock \u2019N Learn sight words and phonics videos can be important resources to help a child learn to read. We\u2019ve been helping kids learn for over 30 years using research-based methods developed with classroom teachers who are highly skilled at helping kids learn to read and write, especially children with disabilities and other challenges.

Developed with speech therapists to form each letter sound correctly. Extra practice reading words with the letter combination SP follows the song.\n\nSP Blend Song lyrics:\n\nThe letter s makes the sound s-s-s\nand the letter p makes the sound p-p-p\nIf we put s and p together, they make the sound: sp-sp-sp\n\nsp - spade  \nsp-sp  spade\nsp - spud \nsp-sp spud\nsp-sp-sp\n\nsp - spider  \nsp-sp  spider\nsp - spout \nsp-sp spout\nsp-sp-sp\n\nsp - sponge \nsp-sp  sponge\nsp - spill \nsp-sp spill\nsp-sp-sp\n\nsp - spoon  \nsp-sp  spoon\nsp \u2013 spice \nsp-sp spice\nsp-sp-sp\n\nsp - spots \nsp-sp spots\nsp - spaniel  \nsp-sp  spaniel\nsp-sp-sp\n\nGreat job!

      "description": "Here\u2019s an effective way to learn to read, spell and write sight words for kids. It's perfect for ESL, preschool, and kindergarten. Dedicated practice with high frequency words is an important component in helping kids learn to read and spell. Although phonemic awareness is important too, tricky words that don\u2019t follow the rules especially need sight words practice.\n\nWith this video, kids learn to read, spell, and write 7 high-frequency words with an easy approach that includes letter tracing and word shapes. These sight words are at a preschool and kindergarten level. As the word shape and outline of each sight word appears, learners have a chance to read the word before hearing it. Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by and subscribe to our channel. New videos posted each week. https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn\n\nThe sight words videos we will be posting each week go with Rock \u2019N Learn Preschool Sight Words video with fun, animated characters and lots of exciting action:  https://youtu.be/wgrtvyu1fOY.\n\nMany teachers and parents make this video part of the routine each day to build reading, spelling, and writing skills. It\u2019s great for classrooms, both in-person and online. You can adapt the approach to be more challenging for advanced students and easier for new or struggling students. Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy. When this video becomes part of a daily routine, children actually tend to look forward to it, as they develop foundational skills and feel the pride that comes from learning. \n\nAll Rock \u2019N Learn sight words and phonics videos can be important resources to help a child learn to read. We\u2019ve been helping kids learn for over 30 years using research-based methods developed with classroom teachers who are highly skilled at helping kids learn to read and write, especially children with disabilities and other challenges. Students learning English for the first time at any age or ability level tend to benefit from this sight words video and the other learning resources from Rock \u2019N Learn. Visit https://www.rocknlearn.com for more information. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel and be sure to give our videos a thumbs up.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying that learning sight words is the only strategy for learning to read. Most children, especially those struggling, benefit from explicit phonics instruction presented in a systematic, orderly progression for learning letter-sound correspondences. Here are free and proven videos from Rock \u2019N Learn for learning to read that will help build phonemic awareness and strong phonics decoding skills:\n\nABC Phonics Song:  https://youtu.be/tKsIi1MH4lw\nLetter Sounds:  https://youtu.be/0wDoUs8hrJM\nPhonics 1:  https://youtu.be/Jam0DCe_bYo\nPhonics 2:  https://youtu.be/plFuEmwVN4o\nPhonics 3:  https://youtu.be/zZ_6dTb0LOQ\nPhonics 4:  https://youtu.be/VQqWs9qIyYU\n\nFor those who prefer DVDs or digital downloads: \nhttps://www.rocknlearn.com\nhttps://www.amazon.com/rocknlearn\n\nRegardless of a child\u2019s IQ or socioeconomic status, Rock \u2019N Learn helps provide the early skills to develop strong reading and writing ability, essential for a child\u2019s success in life.",

      "description": "This animated phonics song helps children learn the sound of the beginning blend SW in English. A blend is a combination of letters where each letter makes its own sound. The sounds of the letters are blended together. Fun characters teach kids two words at a time with the SW sound at the beginning. Kids will love singing along and watching the action after each group of two words. As they do, they\u2019ll practice making the SW beginning blend sound. Developed with speech therapists to form each letter sound correctly. Extra practice reading words with the letter combination SW follows the song.\n\nSW Blend Song lyrics:\n\nThe letter s makes the sound s-s-s\nand the letter w makes the sound w-w-w\nIf we put s and m together, they make the sound: sw-sw-sw\n\nsw - swim  \nsw-sw  swim\nsw - swan \nsw-sw swan\nsw-sw-sw\n\nsw -  sweet \nsw-sw  sweet\nsw - swirl \nsw-sw swirl\nsw-sw-sw\n\nsw - swoop \nsw-sw  swoop\nsw - swerve \nsw-sw swerve\nsw-sw-sw\n\nsw - swap  \nsw-sw  swap\nsw \u2013 sweater \nsw-sw sweater\nsw-sw-sw\n\nsw - sweaty  \nsw-sw  sweaty\nsw - swimsuit \nsw-sw swimsuit\nsw-sw-sw\n\nGreat job!

      "description": "Here\u2019s an effective way to learn to read, spell and write sight words for kids. It's perfect for ESL, preschool, and kindergarten. Dedicated practice with high frequency words is an important component in helping kids learn to read and spell. Although phonemic awareness is important too, tricky words that don\u2019t follow the rules especially need sight words practice.\n\nWith this video, kids learn to read, spell, and write 7 high-frequency words with an easy approach that includes letter tracing and word shapes. These sight words are at a preschool and kindergarten level. As the word shape and outline of each sight word appears, learners have a chance to read the word before hearing it. Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by and subscribe to our channel. New videos posted each week. https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn\n\nThe sight words videos we will be posting each week go with Rock \u2019N Learn Preschool Sight Words video with fun, animated characters and lots of exciting action:  https://youtu.be/wgrtvyu1fOY.\n\nMany teachers and parents make this video part of the routine each day to build reading, spelling, and writing skills. It\u2019s great for classrooms, both in-person and online. You can adapt the approach to be more challenging for advanced students and easier for new or struggling students. Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy. When this video becomes part of a daily routine, children actually tend to look forward to it, as they develop foundational skills and feel the pride that comes from learning. \n\nAll Rock \u2019N Learn sight words and phonics videos can be important resources to help a child learn to read. We\u2019ve been helping kids learn for over 30 years using research-based methods developed with classroom teachers who are highly skilled at helping kids learn to read and write, especially children with disabilities and other challenges. Students learning English for the first time at any age or ability level tend to benefit from this sight words video and the other learning resources from Rock \u2019N Learn. Visit https://www.rocknlearn.com for more information. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel and be sure to give our videos a thumbs up.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying that learning sight words is the only strategy for learning to read. Most children, especially those struggling, benefit from explicit phonics instruction presented in a systematic, orderly progression for learning letter-sound correspondences. Here are free and proven videos from Rock \u2019N Learn for learning to read that will help build phonemic awareness and strong phonics decoding skills:\n\nABC Phonics Song:  https://youtu.be/tKsIi1MH4lw\nLetter Sounds:  https://youtu.be/0wDoUs8hrJM\nPhonics 1:  https://youtu.be/Jam0DCe_bYo\nPhonics 2:  https://youtu.be/plFuEmwVN4o\nPhonics 3:  https://youtu.be/zZ_6dTb0LOQ\nPhonics 4:  https://youtu.be/VQqWs9qIyYU\n\nFor those who prefer DVDs or digital downloads: \nhttps://www.rocknlearn.com\nhttps://www.amazon.com/rocknlearn\n\nRegardless of a child\u2019s IQ or socioeconomic status, Rock \u2019N Learn helps provide the early skills to develop strong reading and writing ability, essential for a child\u2019s success in life.",

Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by and subscribe to our channel. New videos posted each week. https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn\n\nThe sight words videos we will be posting each week go with Rock \u2019N Learn Preschool Sight Words video with fun, animated characters and lots of exciting action:  https://youtu.be/wgrtvyu1fOY.\n\nMany teachers and parents make this video part of the routine each day to build reading, spelling, and writing skills. It\u2019s great for classrooms, both in-person and online. You can adapt the approach to be more challenging for advanced students and easier for new or struggling students. Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy. When this video becomes part of a daily routine, children actually tend to look forward to it, as they develop foundational skills and feel the pride that comes from learning. \n\nAll Rock \u2019N Learn sight words and phonics videos can be important resources to help a child learn to read. We\u2019ve been helping kids learn for over 30 years using research-based methods developed with classroom teachers who are highly skilled at helping kids learn to read and write, especially children with disabilities and other challenges. Students learning English for the first time at any age or ability level tend to benefit from this sight words video and the other learning resources from Rock \u2019N Learn. Visit https://www.rocknlearn.com for more information. Please subscribe to our YouTube channel and be sure to give our videos a thumbs up.\n\nWe\u2019re not saying that learning sight words is the only strategy for learning to read. Most children, especially those struggling, benefit from explicit phonics instruction presented in a systematic, orderly progression for learning letter-sound correspondences. Here are free and proven videos from Rock \u2019N Learn for learning to read that will help build phonemic awareness and strong phonics decoding skills:\n\nABC Phonics Song:  https://youtu.be/tKsIi1MH4lw\nLetter Sounds:  https://youtu.be/0wDoUs8hrJM\nPhonics 1:  https://youtu.be/Jam0DCe_bYo\nPhonics 2:  https://youtu.be/plFuEmwVN4o\nPhonics 3:  https://youtu.be/zZ_6dTb0LOQ\nPhonics 4:  https://youtu.be/VQqWs9qIyYU\n\nFor those who prefer DVDs or digital downloads: \nhttps://www.rocknlearn.com\nhttps://www.amazon.com/rocknlearn\n\nRegardless of a child\u2019s IQ or socioeconomic status, Rock \u2019N Learn helps provide the early skills to develop strong reading and writing ability, essential for a child\u2019s success in life.",

      "description": "Here\u2019s an effective way to learn to read, spell and write sight words for kids. It's perfect for ESL, preschool, and kindergarten. Dedicated practice with high frequency words is an important component in helping kids learn to read and spell. Although phonemic awareness is important too, tricky words that don\u2019t follow the rules especially need sight words practice.\n\nWith this video, kids learn to read, spell, and write 7 high-frequency words with an easy approach that includes letter tracing and word shapes. These sight words are at a preschool and kindergarten level. As the word shape and outline of each sight word appears, learners have a chance to read the word before hearing it. Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by and subscribe to our channel. New videos posted each week. https://www.youtube.com/rocknlearn\n\nThe sight words videos we will be posting each week go with Rock \u2019N Learn Preschool Sight Words video with fun, animated characters and lots of exciting action:  https://youtu.be/wgrtvyu1fOY.\n\nMany teachers and parents make this video part of the routine each day to build reading, spelling, and writing skills. It\u2019s great for classrooms, both in-person and online. You can adapt the approach to be more challenging for advanced students and easier for new or struggling students. Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy. When this video becomes part of a daily routine, children actually tend to look forward to it, as they develop foundational skills and feel the pride that comes from learning. \n\nAll Rock \u2019N Learn sight words and phonics videos can be important resources to help a child learn to read. We\u2019ve been helping kids learn for over 30 years using research-based methods developed with classroom teachers who are highly skilled at helping kids learn to read and write, especially children with disabilities and other challenges.

Research shows the importance of teaching sight words along with phonics, which we will discuss later.\n\nStudents at a higher level can use pencil and paper and attempt to write the words along with the video. If they are not yet skilled enough to write the words with the video, this can be an activity they practice later as you dictate each word slowly enough for young writers to keep up, cuing and assisting them as needed. It is common for kids to have difficulty writing. They will often print the letters backwards and complain how hard writing is. Using this video on a routine basis will take away some of the frustration and give the practice that is needed to gain reading and writing proficiency.\n\nRock \u2019N Learn\u2019s sight words videos complement our phonics programs and work with any curriculum. Even when using phonics-based instruction, which we strongly recommend, some words don\u2019t follow the decoding rules of phonics. Becoming good at reading and writing sight words is essential to build reading fluency and for overall academic success, especially as students advance to higher grades. Sight words, along with phonemic awareness, are part of the building blocks of early childhood literacy.

      "description": "This animated phonics song helps children learn the sound of the ending  blend LF in English. A blend is a combination of letters where each letter makes its own sound. The sounds of the letters are blended together. Fun characters teach kids two words at a time with the LF sound at the end. Kids will love singing along and watching the action after each group of two words. As they do, they\u2019ll practice making the LF ending blend sound. Developed with speech therapists to form each letter sound correctly. Extra practice reading words with the letter combination LF follows the song.\n\n\n\nLF Blend Song lyrics:\n\n\nThe letter L makes the sound l-l-l  \nand the letter F makes the sound f-f-f\nIf we put L and F together at the END of a word, they make the sound: lf-lf-lf\n\n\nlf - elf \nelf lf   \nlf - shelf \nshelf lf  \nlf - lf\n\n\nlf - wolf \nwolf lf   \nlf - golf \ngolf lf \nlf - lf\n \nlf - myself \nmyself lf  \nlf - yourself \nyourself lf \nlf - lf\n\n\nlf - gulf \ngulf lf  \nlf - bookshelf \nbookshelf lf \nlf - lf\n\n\nlf - himself \nhimself lf-lf  \nlf - herself \nherself lf-lf \nlf - lf\n\n\nGreat job!

      "description": "Here\u2019s an effective way to learn to read, spell and write sight words for kids. It's perfect for ESL, preschool, and kindergarten. Dedicated practice with high frequency words is an important component in helping kids learn to read and spell. Although phonemic awareness is important too, tricky words that don\u2019t follow the rules especially need sight words practice.\n\nWith this video, kids learn to read, spell, and write 6 high-frequency words with an easy approach that includes letter tracing and word shapes. These sight words are at a preschool and kindergarten level. As the word shape and outline of each sight word appears, learners have a chance to read the word before hearing it. Kids enjoy seeing each lowercase letter traced. This helps focus attention on the sight words. Learners become better at recognizing the shapes of letters and build spelling skills. Kids see how to print each word as it is modeled for them. Subscribe for more sight words videos each week. \n\nBe sure to like this video by and subscribe to our channel.

Let's open it!   Here\u2026  We\u2026 Go!\nIt's the number five! We can show five as a number like this. \nHow else can we show five? We can spell the word five with letters.\nf\u2026 i\u2026 v\u2026 e\u2026 five! \n\nThis is how you sign the number five. \n\nLook at this 10 frame:\nLet's fill it with counters until we have five. Remember to go from left to right, top to bottom, and don't skip any squares.\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ! \n\nThere! We've shown the number 5 in our 10 frame. Now, let's take these five counters and put them in a different pattern. \nWe didn't add or take away any counters, so we should still have 5. \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 !\n\nWow, still 5 Let's re-arrange them again\u2026 \ndo we still have five?\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 !\nYes! We still have 5 counters, because we didn't add any or take any away.\n\nCounters are fun, but let's show the number 5 in some other ways. Do you like to play games? Look at this die.\nHow many dots are showing?\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 !  Five dots.\n\nWhat about dominoes? How many dots are on this one?\n1 \u2026 2, 3, 4, 5 !  Five dots in all.\n\nHere's another domino. How many dots does it have?\n1, 2 \u2026 3, 4, 5 !  Five dots.\n\nNow, let's draw five tally marks:\nOne, two, three, four, \nNumber five shuts the door!  \n\nI'll bet we can think of even more ways to show the number five. What if we draw five stars?\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ! Five stars.\n\nHere are some smiley faces. How many do you think we have? \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ! Five smiley faces.\n\nLet's draw five petals on this flower:\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ! We drew  five petals on this flower.\n\nDo you like pizza? How many pepperonis are on this slice?\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ! \n\nItalian Chef: Ha, ha! Five Pepperonis. \n\nThere are so many fun ways to show the number 5. We've counted up to 5 together quite a few times! Now, let's count back from 5 all the way down to zero!\n5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0!\n\nRemember, zero is the same as none. Let's clap and count together back up to five. \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5!\n\nNow, point at the number 5, and use your finger to trace it in the air. Here we go!\nStart at the top\u2026 pull down and curve around. Jump back to the top\u2026 and give it a cap!\nYou did it! Five!",

How many dots does it have?  1, 2 \u2026 3. Three dots.\n\nNow, let's draw three tally marks: One, two, three ! \n\nI'll bet we can think of even more ways to show the number three.

We've counted up to 3 together quite a few times! Now, let's count back from 3 all the way down to zero. 3, 2, 1, 0\n\nRemember, zero is the same as none.

Let's open it!  \n        Here\u2026  We\u2026 Go!\n\nIt's the number Eight.\n\nWe can show Eight as a number like this. \n\nHow else can we show Eight? We can spell the word Eight with letters.\ne\u2026 i\u2026 g\u2026 h\u2026 t\u2026 Eight!\n\nThis is how you sign the number Eight. \n\nLook at this 10 frame.\n\nLet's fill it with counters until we have Eight. Remember to go from left to right, top to bottom, and don't skip any squares.\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nThere! We've shown the number 8 in our 10 frame. Now, let's take these Eight counters and put them in a different pattern. \n\nWe didn't add or take away any counters, so we should still have 8. \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nWow, still 8 Let's re-arrange them again\u2026 \ndo we still have Eight?\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nYes! We still have 8 counters, because we didn't add any or take any away.\n\nCounters are fun, but let's show the number 8 in some other ways. Do you like to play games? Look at these dice.\n\nHow many dots are showing?\n1, 2, 3, 4\u2026  5, 6, 7, 8   Eight dots.\n\nWhat about dominoes? How many dots are on this one?\n\n1, 2, 3\u2026 4, 5, 6, 7, 8   Eight dots in all.\n\nHere's another domino.

How many stop signs do you see?  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  Eight stop signs.\n\nSay\u2026 how many sides does this stop sign have? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  \nEight sides! This stop sign is an octagon.\n\nLet's draw 8 arcs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8  Eight arcs. Oh no, they look like frowns! Let's turn them upside down. Smile! That's better!\n\nLook at this octopus. How many legs does it have? \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nCan you SEA all my legs?\nWe sure can -- Oh, (laughs) I SEA what you did there! \n\nThere are so many fun ways to show the number 8. We've counted up to 8 together quite a few times. Now, let's count back from 8 all the way down to zero. \n\n8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0\n\nRemember, zero is the same as none. Let's clap and count together back up to Eight. \n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nNow, point at the number 8, and use your finger to trace it in the air. Here we go!\n\nStart at the top \u2026 make a half circle to the middle\u2026 curve the other way down to the bottom\u2026 finish the bottom circle\u2026 then finish the top circle.\nYou did it!

      "description": "Learning to skip count is a fun and useful skill to help develop number sense. When students begin to notice numerical patterns, they start making generalizations about how numbers work. Their computational skills benefit greatly. Skip counting is especially helpful for understanding and performing multiplication. As kids learn to skip count by rote, they eventually see how the concept relates to real-life math. Learn to skip count by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 25. Students see real objects depicting each group as they practice and gradually build speed. A number line at the bottom of the screen clearly shows how this concept works, with the number being counted highlighted. Kids follow along, have fun, and learn. Developed along with classroom teachers to boost math skills.\n\nChapters:\n00:00   Skip count by twos (wheels on a bicycle)\n00:55   Skip count by threes (sides on a triangle)\n02:20   Skip count by fours (tires on a car)\n03:47   Skip count by fives (fingers)\n04:36   Skip count by sixes (cans in each pack)\n06:02   Skip count by sevens (days in a week)\n07:40   Skip count by eights (crayons in a pack)\n09:18   Skip count by nines (spaces in tic-tac-toe)\n10:46   Skip count by tens (cents for each dime)\n11:43   Skip count by elevens (players on a soccer team)\n13:14   Skip count by twelves (eggs in a carton)\n14:51   Skip count by twenty-fives (cents for each quarter)",
