The air over the water is cooler and heavier. The cool air rushes in toward the low-pressure zone over the land, forming a lovely sea breeze. But what about jet streams?

Like, there are the friends you hang out with, your family, your hockey team, your Crash Course fan club, and that\u2019s just for starters! And even though these groups are totally different, in each of them there\u2019s something that all its members have in common.\n\nWe've learned that all objects---that is, all things made of /matter/--- have properties and qualities that make them different from one another.\n\nLike, the metal water bottle we had in our lunch bag was a good conductor of heat, and the fruit strip was more malleable than the potato chip. Just like groups of people have major things in common, so do different materials. So how does that work? How can we group materials by their properties?\n\n///Standards Used in This Video///\n5-PS1-3. Make observations and measurements to identify materials based on their properties.
