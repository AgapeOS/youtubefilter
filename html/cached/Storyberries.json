When I found I was not getting enough story commissions, I decided to write my own stories. The first two \"Carlota Doesn't Like Yellow \"and\" Carlota's Move\" were published in 2005 by the Editorial Biblioteca Nueva. From there I have collaborated as an illustrator with several publishers, authors and magazines, but I have also continued to invent stories.\n\nIn 2009 I published, together with the author-illustrator Elena Dams \u201cThe Collection of Children's Rights\u201d, ten stories to explain to little ones their rights and those of other children. In 2014 I started my website www.macasmerdou.es dedicated to the design and illustration of personalized products. In 2016 I collaborated as an illustrator in the collection of short stories, \"Los Secrets and Adventures of Posi,\" by Cristina Ozores, edited by the Vellmar\u00ed association, with the collaboration of the Environment and Culture of the Consell Insular de Formentera, an educational project for the dissemination among the youngest of the importance of grasslands of oceanic posidonia in the marine ecosystem of the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nStory therapy is my latest project. It consists of the creation of stories on request, for children who may have a problem, who may need assistance overcoming the circumstances of their life, or who simply want to be protagonists of their own story. I have recently launched my blog where you can see all the stories that I am doing for very special boys and girls. \n\nYou can follow me here: www.cuentoterapia-macasmerdou.blogspot.es \"\n\nMusic:\n\"Simple Music to Frighten Small Children By\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\"Scheming Weasel (faster version)\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\"Sing Along with Jim\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\"Vivacity\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\nAdditional music from:\nhttps://www.zapsplat.com/\n\nThis audio and video was created by Storyberries and it is copyright protected.\n\n\u00a9 Storyberries 2020\n\ud83c\udf53",

His tale of Pembral is in part an ode to his dearly patient mother, whose son was known to his school teachers as a 'day dreamer'. Pembral Forgets invokes the hallmarks of fall, with colorful leaves and frost on the ground, and, of course, the wonderful aroma of baking in the kitchen. It is Steve's first effort as an author.\n\nAbout the Illustrator:\nSue\u00a0Clancy, an American artist, author, and illustrator who lives in Washington state is known for her whimsical, timeless, comforting, quirky and oddly cute art images and artist books often featuring animals. Though she is the author/artist for more than 6 books and numerous fine art exhibits she is still very carefully supervised in her art studio by a miniature longhaired dachshund and a tabby cat. Clancy loves to read, cook and play with words and pictures. You can see more about Clancy's art here:\u00a0www.sueclancy.com\n\nMusic Video: \"Sock Hop\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), \"Amazing Plan\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), \"Hyperfun\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)\nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0 License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ \n\nAdditional music: zapsplat.com, mixkit.co and zapsplat.com\n\nThis audio and video was created by Storyberries and it is copyright protected.\n\n\u00a9 Storyberries 2020\n\ud83c\udf53",

During this time, I was delighted and privileged to also rediscover my love for the arts. I have been taking the opportunity to refine my skill set, learn some new skills and pick up on current technology which serves the artistic community. Few people ever have the privilege of making their passion their pursuit as well and making a career of it, but I am finally in a position to attempt to do just that. With the support of my family, I am enjoying every moment I spend creating my treasured illustrations and showing my sons what is possible when passion meets perseverance.\n\nYou can follow Nicola's work at her Instagram account @nicolaanneillustrates\n\nMusic video and sound effects from zapsplat.com and\n\"Frozen Star\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0, License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\n\"Water Prelude\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com), Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 4.0, License http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ \n\nThis audio and video was created by Storyberries and it is copyright protected.\n\n\u00a9 Storyberries 2020\n\ud83c\udf53",
