It\u2019s \u2018time\u2019 for some happy trees, and we\u2019ve got just what you need: https://pxlfy.me/BobRossWatchMightyMojoToys\nYou\u2019ve seen him before - he's the quiet soft-spoken guy with the fuzzy afro hair painting mountains and trees with big brushes in a matter of seconds. Bob Ross is public television's most beloved personality and here is the behind-the-story look at his journey to becoming America's pop-culture icon.\n\nThis docu-story reveals the personal life of Bob Ross through the loving accounts of close friends and family, childhood photographs, rare archive footage - what you know: his unwavering dedication to wildlife for example, and what you don't know: Bob Ross' straight hair, his fascination with fast cars, and so much more.\n\nYou'll see rare film clips of Bob Ross with mentor William Alexander, and the very first rough-cut Joy of Painting episode. And you'll learn how one little TV commercial to advertise local painting classes slowly turned this gentle-mannered fellow from simple beginnings into a viral phenomenon that continues to allow millions around the world to realize their dream of becoming an artist.\n\nEnjoy fascinating interviews and insights from some famous Bob Ross enthusiasts too, such as talk show pioneer Phil Donahue, film stars Jane Seymour and Terrence Howard, Chef Duff Goldman, and country music favorites Brad Paisley and Jerrod Niemann.\n\nBob Ross: The Happy Painter is presented in three parts: The Man, The Television Artist, and His Legacy.\n\nSubscribe to the official Bob Ross YouTube channel - http://bit.ly/BobRossSubscribe\n\nOfficial Bob Ross website - http://www.BobRoss.com\n\nOfficial Bob Ross Twitch.tv Stream! - http://twitch.tv/BobRoss\n\nOfficial Bob Ross Twitter Account - https://twitter.com/bobrossofficial\n\nAll episodes of Bob Ross are now live on Roku - http://bit.ly/BobRossOnRoku",

And instead of paying me money, I was only about 10 years old. They gave me several exotic pets. And one of them was an Alligator. And he was only about a foot long when they gave him to me. I'll never forget I took that rascal home and I wasn't that popular with my mother when I dropped her onto the living room floor out of a big ol' bag. And I kept him for about a year/year and a half. And he grew to about close to two to three feet long but he got mean. I don't think you could make a pet out of an alligator so I took him down to one of the local lakes and let him loose. Chances are he's still there today, sure he, by now he's probably huge and scarin' swimmers to death.\" \n- Bob Ross \"Cypress Swamp\" 1992 | Season 25 | Episode 8\n\n#shorts #bobross #paintlikebobross\n\nLink to video: https://youtu.be/FdIUHudQABI\n\nhttp://www.BobRoss.com",

Chris is a true Midwestern gentleman, soft spoken and polite -- but the biggest takeaway from our conversation was how much Bob encouraged Chris' artistic side from the moment they met. There were no stakes, no cameras -- and here was a real-life story of a mentor molding a young apprentice.  \n\n\"I feel Bob every step of the way,\" Chris says, describing his career not only as a CRI\u00ae but also as a Senior Director of Sports Production at Ball State University in Indiana.
