This is explained around 3 mins 40. and takes the notes of the melody.  - Eb G and Bb (an arpeggio over that Eb/G chord)  and then to an Ab for that Ab chord. \n\nEverything Matt plays here are chord tones so if you\u2019re having difficulty we\u2019d suggest getting hold of a chord chart for the song in that original key of Eb. The bass notes you\u2019ll be fretting will be one of the three chord tones in the chord being played.  If you haven\u2019t worked through chord tones yet we\u2019d suggest either the Intermediate Worship Bass Course or the Play by Ear and Understand Chords Course, both of which will give you a clearer understanding of the chord tone choices you can play. This will help you narrow down your note choices to one of three in the chord.",

And even look at playing in B with a detuned top E for all sorts of new sounds! There's a section on using a high strung guitar in worship and more worship leading tips from Tim Hughes, David Ruis, Tre Shepherd and Noel Richards.\n\nYou can buy the rest of the 3-DVD set here: http://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/christian-guitar/existing-player/acoustic-worship-guitar.html\n\nFor instant access to ALL Musicademy's 1,200 worship training videos head over to our online video streaming subscription site https://www.musicademy.com/training",

In this part 2, you will be guided to play the song How Great is Our God in a step by step manner with the tutor explaining all the different chords and voicings available. Unless you are already familiar with chords based playing we would recommend that you first watch part 1.\n\nIn part 3 (available along with many other lessons, from http://www.musicademy.com/info/worship-keyboard/) you can enjoy a play through of the song with the Muscademy band.\n\nOnce you have been through these lessons more proficient players can progress to the rest of the Intermediate course. If you are less experienced and would like to consolidate your new learning with relatively simple songs go to the Beginners course (volumes 3 and 4 would be ideal) or our online video Keyboard Song Learner lessons.You can download a chord chart in the free members section of our website and if you would like a further detailed explanation of chords based playing, you will also find some written articles there.\n\nhttp://www.musicademy.com/info/worship-keyboard/\n\nFor instant access to ALL Musicademy's 1,200 worship training videos head over to our online video streaming subscription site https://www.musicademy.com/training",

      "description": "Here's a complete lesson taken from Musicademy's Worship Keyboard Collection. Teaching Matt Redman and Jonas Myrin's You Alone Can Rescue, this lesson focuses on teaching riffs and interesting lines the keyboard player can use as well as making the most of different sounds on the keyboard itself.\n\nThis lesson gives a good introduction to the style of teaching on the Worship Keyboard Collection where you will learn the keyboard parts to 18 different songs. First you listen to a professional (Worship Backing Band) recording of the song and hear tutor Tim Martin discussing and unpacking the different sounds and techniques. An on screen chord chart also guides you through the song. Tim then teaches each of those parts using camera close-ups of the keyboard before inviting you to join him in a play through. These lessons will radically improve your playing of both these individual worship songs but also improve your overall musicianship.\n\nBuy the DVD here http://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/keyboards/beginner/worship-keyboard-collection.html\nFor instant access to ALL Musicademy's 1,200 worship training videos head over to our online video streaming subscription site https://www.musicademy.com/training\n\nWatching this lesson is also a good opportunity for you to see our Worship Backing Band MultiTrack software in action. This isolates the different instruments enabling you to either solo them or remove them from the mix.\n\n\nChord charts\n\nYou can buy the Worship Keyboard Collection either on DVD or in our online subscription site. The 18 chord charts used in the series are available in a discounted bundle pack \nhttp://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/chord-charts/keyboard-chord-charts.html\nor you can buy the chord chart for You Alone Can Rescue individually. http://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/chord-charts/chord-chart-you-alone-can-rescue.html",

      "description": "Could your worship team spare just two hours for some invaluable practical training that will forever improve how you play together? \n\nWorship Team Workshops are a growing range of downloadable video-based training courses from Musicademy that your worship team can work through together in a single session in the space you\u2019d normally rehearse; whether that\u2019s at church, in a practice room or even at home.\n\nThe workshops unpack invaluable skills through a series of training videos to watch together alongside guided group discussions, practical exercises and plenty space to play together to try out the learning. \n\nEach workshop is designed around a two-hour session and split into parts so can be approached piecemeal if you have less time in a single sitting. Plus, there are participant worksheets, facilitator notes to help guide the group leader and even backing tracks and chord charts to try out the learning with.\n\nCourse materials include:\n- Downloadable video-based training lessons\n- Printable delegate notes for all participates\n- Printable facilitator notes for group leaders\n- Worship song backing tracks\n- Chord charts\n\nDownload the workshops here http://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/worship-band-skills/worship-team-workshop.html\n\nThere are currently three workshops available to buy. And a 20% discount is automatically applied at the checkout when all three are purchased at the same time.\n\nThe workshops are designed for novice and seasoned musicians alike with learning that applies to both contemporary and orchestral instruments. Each takes 2 hours but can also be worked through in three smaller parts - 60/30/30 mins - if your team has less time in a single sitting.\n\nWorkshop: Understanding Groove\n- What is groove and why it\u2019s important\n- Rhythmic mistakes that worship teams typically make\n- How to find a consistent groove within any song\n- How to find your instrument\u2019s individual role within the groove\n- How to create rhythmic and textural balance in the overall sound\n\nWorkshop: Dynamics\n- Developing and using range\n- Creating space in music\n- Understanding different types of dynamics\n- Using dynamics and tips for playing dynamically\n- Building tension and release\n\nWorkshop: Listening and Communication Skills\n- Setting up your stage to develop listening and communication skills\n- Understanding different types of musical communication\n- Developing musical communication skills with and without instrument\n- Communication in rehearsals: tips and ideas\n- Buy Listening and Communication Skills now\n\n\nDownload the workshops here http://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/worship-band-skills/worship-team-workshop.html\n\nVideos\nThe training videos are taken from Musicademy\u2019s critically acclaimed Worship Band Skills course but distilled into bite-sized lessons focused on developing a single skill.\n\nDiscussions\nIts really important for your team to have space to collectively reflect on how the learning might apply to them, so between the videos we guide you through some pertinent questions to help encourage honest but productive discussion.\n\nExercises\nOnce we\u2019ve explored the learning in the videos and discussions we build in some fun and enlightening practical group exercises to help everyone develop the skills as a team.\n\nSpace to play together\nThen after the exercises we leave plenty of time to play together to practice those skills in the context of well-known worship songs.\n\nWorksheets, backing tracks and chord charts\nWe provide worksheets for each participant to help them understand the course schedule with space to make notes, and key ideas to remember. Some courses also feature worship song backing tracks and accompanying chord charts to use to work through the learning.\n\nFacilitator notes\nIn addition to the participant worksheets we provide some written notes for the group leader/facilitator. These help them guide everyone through the course, keep the schedule on time, facilitate the discussions and exercises, encourage participation and be aware of potential \u2018hotspot\u2019 issues.\n\n\nDownload the workshops here http://www.musicademy.com/store/uk/worship-band-skills/worship-team-workshop.html",
