One, two! And through and through\nThe vorpal blade went snicker-snack!\nHe left it dead, and with its head\nHe went galumphing back.\n\n\"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?\nCome to my arms, my beamish boy!\nO frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'\n  He chortled in his joy.\n\n`Twas brillig, and the slithy toves\nDid gyre and gimble in the wabe;\nAll mimsy were the borogoves,\nAnd the mome raths outgrabe.\n\nSubscribe to FreeSchool: https://www.youtube.com/user/watchfreeschool?sub_confirmation=1\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/watchFreeSchool\n\nCheck our our companion channel, FreeSchool Mom! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcEtHRQhqiCZIIb77LyDmA\n\nAnd our NEW channel for little ones, FreeSchool Early Birds!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3OV62x86XHwaqsxLsuy8dA\n\nMusic: Jaunty Gumption, Lord of the Land - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)",

This is the story of Apollo 11, the mission that took Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins to the moon and take that historic \"one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Watch the launch of the massive Saturn V rockets, listen to exchanges between the astronauts and mission control, see footage from the historic space mission that landed on the moon, and find out more about how the astronauts got to the moon (and back!) and what they did there!\n\nIf you are studying the moon landing, I highly recommend visiting http://wechoosethemoon.org - it's an immersive interactive website with video, audio, and photos, arranged to feel like you're participating in the moon mission!\n\nThis movie is different than my other videos because it is made of historical and archival footage from NASA. Thank you, NASA for allowing your materials to be used!!!\n\nSubscribe to FreeSchool: https://www.youtube.com/user/watchfreeschool?sub_confirmation=1\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/watchFreeSchool\n\nMusic: Jaunty Gumption - Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)",

Today, Pachelbel's Canon is a popular choice for weddings and funerals, and is perfect for a soothing background.\n\nSubscribe to FreeSchool: https://www.youtube.com/user/watchfreeschool?sub_confirmation=1\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/watchFreeSchool\n\nCheck our our companion channel, FreeSchool Mom! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTcEtHRQhqiCZIIb77LyDmA\n\nAnd our NEW channel for little ones, FreeSchool Early Birds!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3OV62x86XHwaqsxLsuy8dA\n\nMusic: Canon in D by Johann Pachelbel, Canon in D Major by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100301\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

The Maya were fierce warriors who practiced human sacrifice, but they were also scholars, writers, mathematicians, astronomers, and artists.

Do you know what sound a giraffe makes? It's not surprising if you don't. For a long time people thought giraffes didn't make any sounds at all.

New research published in 2015 claimed that giraffes \"hum\" at night and provided some fascinating recordings of this phenomenon.\n\nSubscribe to FreeSchool:  https://www.youtube.com/user/watchfreeschool?sub_confirmation=1\n\nVisit us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/watchFreeSchool\n\nOr check out our website for more content: http://www.freeschoolpublishing.com/",

In the bleak landscape of 19th-century England, she struggles to find her purpose - and somewhere to belong. After years at boarding school, her path leads her to the mysterious Thornfield Hall, where she takes a position as a governess._\n\n_There, she meets the dark and enigmatic Mr. Rochester, and what begins as a curious acquaintanceship soon blossoms into a love charged with passion and peril. But Thornfield and its brooding master hide deep secrets that will divide her loyalty and place Jane in an impossible position. Will she surrender, or will she be true to herself, no matter the cost?_\n\nThis version of Jane Eyre has been adapted to a 6th-grade reading level, to provide a more accessible entry into classic literature without removing large passages of the story. Great pains have been taken to retain as much of the original work as possible, while still reducing the reading difficulty. \n*Examples of the changes made include:*\n\u2022 Simplification of sentence structure\n\u2022 Updating or providing context for obsolete words\n\u2022 Translation of foreign-language passages\n\u2022 Replacing advanced vocabulary with simpler words\n\u2022 This edition also contains hand-drawn pen-and-ink illustrations.\n\n*Readers who may benefit from this version of the novel include:*\n\u2022 Teenage readers\n\u2022 Students with learning disabilities\n\u2022 English as a Second Language (ESL) or English Language Learners (ELL) readers\n\u2022 Adult literacy learners\n\u2022 Educators\n\u2022 Casual readers\n\nThe thumbnail image includes an image by wirestock on Freepik.",
