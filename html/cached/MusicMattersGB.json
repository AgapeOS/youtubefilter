Gareth and Alex play a piano and organ duet to commemorate Remembrance Day as we remember all who have fought and fallen in war. The music of 'Nimrod' from the Enigma Variations is the work that sealed Elgar's fame. Its profound beauty and reflective nature make it a favourite among those seeking a moment of calm. It is always played at the Cenotaph, Whitehall in London at the National Service of Remembrance held on Remembrance Day. We decided to take Elgar's original arrangement of Nimrod for piano solo and incorporate the sustain and power of the organ to create a piano and organ duet.\n\n\"They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.

They can also be used as a means of modulation, which is what is demonstrated in this music theory lesson. Watch as we clarify the nature of a Diminished 7th chord and explain how it functions within a key. We then go on to suggest how the Diminished 7th can be a most effective means of modulation, especially when one makes enharmonic alterations to notes within the chord.

      "description": "Learn how to use a German 6th chord to modulate from one key to another. The German 6th has a chromatic chord function within the key to which it belongs and can add helpful colour and tension to the harmony. The German 6th can also provide a useful way to modulate as an alternative to using pivot notes or pivot chords, especially when one considers that a German 6th in one key is an enharmonic equivalent of a Dominant 7th in another key. Using a German 6th chord in this way can effect an immediate modulation into a key five flats away from the starting key, thereby enabling extreme modulation. This music theory lesson explains the construction of the German 6th chord, explains its conventional use, then shows how useful it is as a means of modulation. Really useful for composers and arrangers, and helpful to performers and analysts wanting to understand such functions in the music they are performing. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to modulation using the german 6th\n1:47 - What is a german 6th chord?\n3:26 - Using the german 6th chord to change key\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "You may be familiar with modulating to a different key using a pivot chord but can you modulate using a pivot note? Use this modulation technique to modulate to more extreme keys. When Baroque composers first ventured into the realms of modulation they used pivot chords i.e. a chord that belonged both to the key they were leaving and to the key they were joining. This gave them a smooth transition from one key to another and served musicians well during the Baroque and Classical periods. By the 19th century there was a desire to be more radical in modulation by moving to more extreme keys rather than simply to nearby keys. The problem encountered was that there were no pivot chords linking keys that were far apart so composers alighted on the idea of using single pivot notes. This music theory lesson explains and illustrates the technique and having watched it you will be able to modulate to any key you wish by learning how to make effective use of pivot notes. It\u2019s a real liberation. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to modulation using a pivot note\n1:59 - Pivot chords vs pivot notes\n3:23 - Using a pivot note to change key\n4:41 - Using a different pivot note to move keys\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Name that Carol Challenge! How many can you get? This Christmas Toccata was composed by Gareth Green and appears here as a Music Matters Christmas Quiz. In it, we hear 8 Christmas Carols, one which is used extensively and seven others that are weaved in with various degrees of subtlety. Can you name the Christmas Carols? After an introduction based on Bach\u2019s famous Toccata in D Minor, there follows a Fugue that uses as it\u2019s Subject the main Carol of the work. Later the piece breaks into a more energetic section based on Widor\u2019s famous Toccata from his 5th Organ Symphony. After a brief reference to Beethoven\u2019s \u201cFur Elise\u201d, the piece concludes more reflectively based on the final Carol.\n\n\ud83c\udfbcChristmas Toccata - Get your copy of this score here!\nFor organists wanting to obtain a copy of the score here is a link to the publisher...\nhttps://ejmusicpublishing.com/collections/gareth-green\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Christmas Toccata\n0:07 - Christmas challenge rules\n1:46 - Playing the piece\n7:15 - Revealing the answers\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Learn how to modulate using the Neapolitan chord, a more advanced modulation technique that allows you to move keys quite dramatically. In this music theory lesson we explain how to use the Neapolitan Chord as a means of modulating to a key five flats away from the starting key. We show you how to construct a Neapolitan Chord and how to make conventional use of it as a chromatic chord within a key. Then we demonstrate how the Neapolitan Chord can be used in order to modulate to a key five flats away from the starting key. This is a really useful technique for composers and arrangers, as well as helping performers and analysts to understand what is happening in the music they are performing. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to modulation using the Neapolitan chord\n2:15 - What is a Neapolitan chord?\n4:21 - Modulation using the Neapolitan chord\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "In this episode of composing for the piano we take the Music Matters theme and present it as a Waltz in Romantic style. The Music Matters theme was originally written in 4 time. By converting it into 3 time with some rhythmic reorganisation this arrangement by Gareth presents the same theme in Waltz character. The video also demonstrates how to write an effective texture on three levels, with the melody at the top, chord stability in the middle, and with a faster-moving rolling left hand generating rhythmic momentum as well as providing the bass and further filling out the chords. There are also some changes to the harmony to illustrate other possibilities for harmonisation.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the piece\n1:08 - Looking at the harmony\n4:24 - Rhythmic choices in the melody\n4:48 - Thinking about texture\n5:34 - What does it sound like?\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Accidentals might be flagging up a key change, or they might be decorative chromatic notes, or they might be signifying a minor key, or they may be part of a chromatic chord.

      "description": "Minor key harmony can be very complicated. Many people are reasonably happy about choosing chords to harmonize a melody in a major key but minor keys present particular challenges, especially when trying to figure out your way around the natural minor scale, melodic minor scale and harmonic minor scale and dealing with the inevitable conflicts between melody and harmony. In this music theory lesson, we show you how to add chords and harmonize a melody in a minor key and you will learn some of the most successful minor key chord options and chord progressions. Additionally there is advice on avoiding the pitfalls of harmonizing in melodies in a minor key and how to end up with chords that paint the melody well, while adding suitable colour and harmonic rhythm that functions well. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to minor key harmony\n0:33 - Harmonic vs melodic minor scales\n3:01 - Working out the basic diatonic chords\n5:32 - Thinking about cadences\n10:54 - Completing the chord scheme\n17:20 - Plotting the bass line\n18:29 - Filling out the middle parts\n20:33 - Checking for consecutives\n21:35 - What does it sound like?\n21:48 - Adding inessential notes and other details\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In this music composition lesson we analyse the harmony of the opening section of Bach\u2019s C Minor Partita, BWV 826 and explores the chords Bach uses to enrich his harmonic vocabulary, giving ideas to composers and arrangers who want to write more colourful, exciting harmony. During this extract Bach uses extended chords and chromatic chords, such as Diminished 7ths, to elaborate the harmony and to create drama - techniques that could be applied in many different musical styles.

      "description": "Harmonizing a melody using chromatic chords and advanced harmonic techniques to effect modulation to extreme keys. The melody to be harmonized includes an extreme modulation from Eb to B major before travelling back to Eb major. This music theory lesson demonstrates step by step the most effective ways to complete the harmony, using augmented 6th chords, secondary dominants, diminished 7ths, borrowed chords and chromatically altered extended chords. The harmonization also includes the use of enharmonic equivalents as pivot notes in modulation. By the end of this music theory lesson you will know how to harmonize melodies using sophisticated chords, chromatic notes, and modulation to extreme keys. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to extreme modulation using chromatic harmony\n2:14 - Working with a very chromatic melody\n3:30 - Choosing the initial chords\n4:50 - Modulation or secondary dominant?\n11:17 - Dealing with suspensions\n15:07 - Borrowed chords, extended chords and diminished chords choices\n20:40 - Extreme modulation using enharmonic pivot notes\n26:02 - Augmented 6th chords\n32:15 - Playing the finished piece\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Classical melody writing tricks and music composition techniques. We begin with an exploration of how melody notes must either belong to the harmony or be identified as inessential notes. We then move on to consider how conjunct and disjunct movement can be balanced to add impact to a melody and explain how to organise harmonic rhythm in such a way as to add pace and direction to a melody while using it to avoid predictability. Finally, we reflect on how to add rhythmic character to a melody. These four classical melody writing tricks will transform your melody writing and music compositions. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to classical melody writing tricks\n0:32 - Justifying every note\n9:01 - Conjunct and disjunct movement\n10:59 - Harmony and harmonic rhythm\n14:17 - Rhythmic character\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Some keyboard players tend to read individual lines from left to right on the score. This is useful for absorbing melodic lines and patterns. Other keyboard players tend to read vertically by preference - in other words they read chords rather than melodic patterns. The best sight readers do both. If you're looking to improve your sight reading of harder pieces and become a proficient sight reader this advanced sight reading video will show you how to go about learning to sight read music both horizontally and vertically.

      "description": "Yes, the notes E#, B#, Cb and Fb really do exist and it's important to know why. In this music theory lesson we explain the often confusing topic of enharmonic equivalents and why in music we sometimes have to call a note E# instead of F, or B# instead of C, or Fb instead of E, or Cb instead of B as well as sometimes needing to use double sharps or double flats. We clear up the theory behind the issue, look at why scales and keys have to be organised according to certain patterns, and why scales are organised with one of each letter of the musical alphabet, sometimes necessitating the use of  E#, B#, Fb, Cb, double sharps and double flats. We'll then investigate the use of E#, B#, Fb, Cb, double sharps and double flats in two pieces of music, one by Bach, the other by Chopin. This music theory lesson will clear up any confusion about enharmonic equivalents.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15hZqqIBaymeXMt_u7Jov6j5mngvBPw84/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the notes B#, E#, Cb and Fb\n0:27 - Learning about enharmonic equivalents\n6:32 - Double sharps and double flats\n9:18 - Examples of enharmonics in pieces by Bach and Chopin\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Why do they exist and what are they? In this music theory lesson we explain the Natural Minor scale and clear up confusions that people often have between Modes and Natural Minor scales. We then look at how to distinguish the Natural Minor scale from the Harmonic and Melodic scales showing what they have in common and how they vary. By the end of this music theory lesson you will know why the 3 minor scales exist and their uses. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to minor scales\n0:38 - The natural minor scale\n2:04 - Difference between the natural minor scale and a mode\n4:50 - The harmonic minor scale\n6:21 - The melodic minor scale\n8:21 - Why do we have 3 minor scales?\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "How to work out which notes belong to the harmony and which are non-harmonic tones. In this music theory lesson we take a busy melody in F# minor and explain how to classify all the notes as harmony notes or as non-harmonic tones and inessential notes. Having alighted on a harmonic framework that fits the given melody we explain the various types of non-harmonic tones and inessential notes. We then go through the given melody explaining which notes are harmony notes, which are auxiliary notes, which are passing notes, which are anticipatory notes and which are appoggiaturas, covering chromatic notes on the way. This music theory lesson will be particularly useful for composers and arrangers needing to work with a sensible paced harmonic rhythm in the context of a fast-moving melody. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to non-harmonic tones and inessential notes\n0:22 - Working out the key of the music\n3:10 - Non-harmonic tones and inessential notes examples\n8:31 - Working through the melodic example\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Often it is possible to count 2 or 4 beats to the same piece of music. In this music theory lesson we explain the subtle difference between 2/4 and 4/4 in terms of accentuation of strong and weak beats.

      "description": "The Mannheim school of composers, led by Stamitz, steered significant musical developments during the second half of the eighteenth century. This music appreciation lesson explains some of their most significant innovations and explains the impact they had on the course of music. An often underestimated group, their contribution was huge. Apart from the development of the Symphony and of Sonata Form, the inclusion of the Clarinet, and the simplification of the Baroque style they initiated, they also introduced fun devices such as the Mannheim Rocket, the Mannheim Birds, and the Mannheim Sigh. What were these devices and how did subsequent composers embrace them? Watch this lesson to find out how these composers influenced great composers like Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the Mannheim School of Composers\n2:24 - Who were the Mannheim composers?\n3:33 - What did they do?\n11:44 - Some of their compositional innovations\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

When it comes to inessential notes many musicians understand passing notes, understand auxiliary notes, and are happy about anticipatory notes. But what about escape notes, also known as escape tones or echappee? Here we explain what they are and clarify the various ways in which these patterns qualify as echappee.

This music composition lesson explores how to take a melody with a given chord scheme as a basis for adding an additional melodic line, writing a counter-melody or descant. We explore why 3rds and 6ths are particularly useful in this endeavour but why they don\u2019t always work in relation to the given chord scheme. We also explore how and when to use other intervals and how to write a second melodic line that has an independent melodic and rhythmic character, yet belongs well to the primary melodic line. This topic will be especially valuable to composers and arrangers but also to improvisers. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to writing a descant\n0:33 - A look at the solo melody\n1:24 - Which intervals work best?\n5:35 - Keeping the chords in mind\n9:46 - Writing our descant\n19:35 - Playing the finished melody\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Some people need to understand the theory behind writing out a piece in a transposed key; others want to get better better at reading a piece in one key and playing it in another. This music theory lesson explains the safest method for written transposition then goes on to explore the topic from a practical perspective.

      "description": "How to read chords on a lead sheet on the piano. Many pieces of music are presented in lead sheet format i.e. where a melodic line is printed with chord symbols above. What do these symbols mean and how does one play from a lead sheet? This music theory lesson explains how major, minor, diminished, and augmented chords are written on a lead sheet, then goes on to cover the notation of various 7th chords. All of the information is then related to a piece of music and we demonstrate how to play the melody with the various indicated chords. If you\u2019re not sure about lead sheets and how they work or if you want to improve your grasp of lead sheets this is the lesson for you. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1_I9jlAOtGmv89csuvAFFXLROylTIdKDS/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to reading chords on a lead sheet\n0:42 - Playing the melody\n1:27 - Basic chord symbols and notation\n6:35 - Extended chord symbols and notation\n11:57 - Polychords\n14:22 - Slash chords\n15:10 - Working through the lead sheet\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson begins with what is often a typical working of a four-part harmony exercise, which doesn\u2019t sound bad but doesn\u2019t sound good. We explore what works and what could work better. By flushing out the technical faults then explaining how to repair them, a better result starts to take shape. Beyond that the video considers how to embellish some notes to improve the flow and expressive qualities of the piece. The transformation is substantial.

A lot of people are happier doing this in major keys than they are in minor keys so in this music composition lesson we're going to learn how to choose the right chords in a minor key. There are various challenges that present themselves when working in minor keys, for example dealing with augmented 2nds and ensuring that there is no conflict of interest between the harmonic minor and melodic minor scales. Various chord progressions are considered to show how to create the most effective chord movement, the aim being to discover effective chords that paint and colour the melody, while maintaining an effective harmonic rhythm. Having watched this music composition lesson you will feel much more confident about choosing the right chords in minor keys. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to choosing chords in minor keys\n1:22 - Working out the key of the music\n6:25 - Writing out the basic diatonic chords\n7:21 - Choosing chords for the first phrase\n15:44 - Choosing chords for the second phrase\n22:08 - What does it sound like?\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "The submediant shift involves using a pivot note to move from one key to another that is four flats to the left on the circle of fifths. In this music composition lesson you'll learn a technique that will add colour to your harmony and that will offer a way to modulate in one move to a key that is four flats away on the circle of fifths. For example, the note C belongs to the tonic chord of C major but by repeating the note as the middle note of a tonic chord in Ab major, a moment of colour can be created in C major or a modulation to the flattened submediant key can be instantly achieved. A really useful device for composers and arrangers. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the submediant shift\n0:35 - Pivot chord modulation\n2:09 - Pivot note modulation\n3:25 - Incorporating the submediant shift technique\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "How to improve your piano accompaniments. This music performance lesson explores how to bring piano accompaniments to life when you simply have a set of chords to read. When piano and other keyboard players read a melody from a lead sheet that is supplied with chords, the temptation is to play the melody in the right hand and to put down block chords in the left hand. The result is something that sounds accurate but is not very expressive or musically satisfying. In this video we explore how to use the given chords as the basis for figuration, arpeggiation etc, and how to spread notes effectively across the texture so there is not a huge gap between the melody and the chords, avoiding a thick clunky sound in the left hand. This video will provide ideas to explore and to develop a personal style that works for you. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to improving your piano accompaniments\n0:38 - The most common mistake people make\n3:40 - Creating a better texture\n5:17 - Incorporating some figuration\n8:23 - Adapting some of the chords\n8:48 - Accompanying a singer or another instrument\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In the standard four-part choir we expect to find Sopranos, Altos, Tenors, and Basses. The Tenors generally sing at a range an octave below the Sopranos, while the Basses do the same below the Altos. Terms are clarified, such as the difference between Alto, Contralto and Counter Tenor, and the additional intermediate voices are also covered, such as the Mezzo Sopranos and Baritones. By the end of this music theory lesson you will understand the various voice types, their ranges, and the principles of writing for voices in a choral framework. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to classical voice types\n0:19 - Standard four-part choir\n1:05 - Other voice types\n4:30 - Vocal ranges\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson explains melodic and harmonic progressions designed during the Galant period (1720-1770) as summaries of ways to begin or end phrases. A number of progressions known as the Galant Schemata were constructed in response to a desire to simplify the ornate elaborations of the Baroque. These progressions became commonly used by many famous composers and are still relevant today.

      "description": "The history of musical pitch. Many of us assume that musical pitch has always been gauged at the same level but this is not the case. Concert pitch is the pitch reference to which a group of musical instruments are tuned for a performance. Even though it is generally agreed that the concert pitch standard today is A=440hz this has not always been the case. This music appreciation lesson explores the variations in pitch since the Baroque period and explains how the 440hz was eventually standardised, recognising that even now there is variation. This fascinating topic explains much about pitch variation over the centuries and the impact it has made on music. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the history of musical pitch\n2:37 - What went on before A=440hz?\n4:21 - What evidence is there of earlier tunings?\n8:45 - The A=440hz standard on the piano\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In this music performance lesson we begin by exploring the most common symptoms that people experience before going on to consider practical ways of dealing with performance nerves. When we get nervous we can experience rapid pulse and agitated breathing, a dry mouth, shaking hands, trembling voice, sweaty hands, nausea amongst other symptoms. So what can we do about these performance nerves? We consider the quality of practice, things to avoid on the day in terms of stimulants, how to shift the focus from self to the positives of the performance, how to transform negative self-fulfilling prophecies to positive expectations, how to prepare on the day mentally and psychologically, and much more besides. This music performance lesson will really help you deal with nerves on the day. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to music exam nerves\n2:07 - Symptoms of nerves while performing\n5:15 - What can you do to beat exam nerves?\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "How to play from a lead sheet and inject some musical style into the accompaniment. This music performance lesson begins with some key reminders about reading from a lead sheet and then demonstrates a basic reading, presenting the melody in the right hand and the chords in the left hand. Having discovered the shortcomings of this approach the video explains how to organise the chords in a more satisfying way then explores options for distribution of the rhythm and texture in ways that bring out the character of the song. The video ends with a more sophisticated performance. Useful for anyone wanting to achieve a really satisfying interpretation of a lead sheet. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17XhuFnusj9s33kZhZ0y0TemeK-qsY_6F/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to interpreting a lead sheet with style\n1:02 - The common mistake people make\n5:32 - Cleaning up the sound\n10:04 - Improving the rhythmic flow\n11:50 - Chord additions\n14:48 - Putting it all together\n18:10 - An example performance\n19:46 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "What is the difference between 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures? Mathematically it appears that 3/4 and 6/8 are two versions of the same thing. On the face of it, there may appear to be little difference between music in 3/4 time or music in 6/8 time. Musically they are quite distinct, 3/4 being a Simple Triple time and 6/8 being a Compound Duple time. In this music theory lesson the detail of this is unpacked and examples played that demonstrate the essential differences. It is important for players and composers alike to grasp this topic in order to avoid confusing the two. By the end of this music theory lesson you will hear a distinct difference and it will help you to communicate the distinction between the two time signatures in the music you perform. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the difference between 3/4 and 6/8 time signatures\n0:35 - The theory behind time signatures\n6:48 - How can you tell the difference?\n11:29 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

The use of low dynamics, slow tempo and plenty of rhythmic space are just three of the ingredients employed by Debussy to create the intended atmosphere, with three thematic ideas constructed, contrasted and combined to provide structure and variety. The underpinning thread that unites the whole piece is the use of the whole tone scale. The two transpositions of the whole tone scale are explored as well as how Debussy uses the whole tone scale in \u201cVoiles\u201d melodically and harmonically. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZKnq8JD7Hp22BBF2KFdi36jywpMogT7z/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Debussy's use of the whole tone scale\n3:13 - Playing the piece\n4:57 - The whole tone scale\n8:41 - Analysing the piece\n16:28 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "What is a Tritone Substitution? How do you work out a tritone substitution? How do you use one? The tritone is defined and it\u2019s use within a Dominant 7th chord is explored. The inversion of the tritone is demonstrated as a means of finding the tritone substitution then the replacement of the Dominant 7th with a tritone substitution is explored. Different ways of finding the tritone substitution are investigated and comparison is made with other ways of seeing the tritone substitution e.g. as a German 6th chord. By the end of this music theory lesson you will understand what a tritone substitution is, how to find it, and how to use it. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to tritone substitutions\n0:24 - How a tritone works\n3:55 - Why is the tritone called the devil's interval?\n4:29 - How to resolve a tritone\n5:16 - What is it substituting?\n9:18 - Finding tritone substitutions in different keys\n11:31 - The best ways to use a tritone substitution \n14:21 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "How did Franz Liszt compose and what are some of the hallmarks of his compositional style? We try to get inside the head of Liszt and unpack the first page of his monumental Sonata in B minor for piano, of 1854. We explore the shielding of the home key, the key and modulatory scheme, and the ambiguity of the tonality. The use of the Diminished 7th is a particular focus along with the use of scale passages suggesting more than one possible key. In addition, melodic and rhythmic devices are explored, as well as Liszt\u2019s use of texture and motifs within the internal structure. This composer insights lesson will be of interest to those seeking a greater understanding of Liszt\u2019s style as well as those wanting to develop analytical skills or wanting to write in this dramatic style. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1IHuVOEi21vZzRVAA6Qwaxk634GRx6mBE/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how did Liszt compose?\n1:16 - Playing the piece\n1:51 - Analysing the piece\n19:34 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Understand the difference between 2/2 and 4/4 time signatures. Mathematically it appears that 2/2 and 4/4 are two versions of the same thing. Musically they are quite distinct because 2/2 contains two minim beats per bar, while 4/4 contain four crotchet beats per bar, giving the two time signatures a very different feel from each other.  In this music theory lesson the detail of this is unpacked and examples played that demonstrate the essential differences. It is important for players and composers alike to grasp this topic in order to avoid confusing the two time signatures.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the difference between 2/2 and 4/4 time signatures\n0:17 - The theory behind time signatures\n3:46 - How can you tell the difference?\n6:02 - The importance of the difference\n8:04 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "An insight into the introduction of George Michael\u2019s \u201cCareless Whisper\u201d to discover the skills employed to create the opening to this iconic song. This video lays out the chord scheme used during the introduction and demonstrates the rather plain nature of the basic chord progression. We then unpack the extensions used on the chords and show how they enrich the harmony. Having explored the harmonic scheme we explore how the extended chords are used in the melodic line to create a memorable introduction. Useful for those who want to understand how this song and this style work and useful for songwriters and composers interested in expanding their approach. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to George Michael's skillful use of extended chords\n0:52 - Playing the introduction\n1:47 - Exploring the chord plan\n4:02 - Melodic use of extended notes\n8:01 - Structural design of the intro\n9:27 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In both systems there is an element of logic that helps to grasp how it works and it is useful for musicians to be able to translate between the two.

      "description": "Bach loves to use scalic bass lines within his chorales as a solid foundation for building the harmonic structure. Often the bass lines interact with the other parts within the texture to create a conversational type of movement. Let's find out how and why he does this by examining the choice of harmony, chromatic chords, secondary dominants, borrowed chords. and modulation, the part writing, the use of inessential notes and suspensions, plus other features of the Bach Chorale style. Useful for anyone wanting to improve their ability to write harmony, to analyse harmony, or to understand the detail of Bach\u2019s style.

      "description": "What does pandiatonicism mean in music? How did pandiatonicism come about and which composers used it? This music theory lesson explains pandiatonicism, \u2018pan\u2019 meaning \u2018all\u2019 and \u2018diatonic\u2019 meaning inside a key. Examples are explored which illustrate how the style is diatonic rather than chromatic and how chords are built through extension or note addition within the diatonic scale. The non-functional aspect of the pandiatonic style is unpacked and composers such as Stravinsky, Copland, Hindemith, Milhaud, as well as jazz composers working in the style are compared with other approaches such as Serialism. This video will be useful to performers, composers and students of twentieth century music.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1SncdgYnTKw6qpRtC7nclaRZ4CVI4iM_j/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to pandiatonicism\n0:35 - What does pandiatonic mean?\n3:52 - Where does the term pandiatonicism come from?\n6:20 - Chord building\n8:15 - How did pandiatonicism come about?\n9:29 - Stravinsky example\n11:49 - Jazz example\n15:02 - Major and minor keys and chord hierarchy\n16:08 - Pandiatonic composers\n16:51 - Copland example\n18:43 - Serialism vs pandiatonicism\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "How did Brahms go about composing music? Let's explore part of the opening section of the Intermezzo op118 no2 by Brahms as we try to answer that very question. We explain how Brahms handles the repetition of the opening phrase, which occurs four times, and explores what is repeated and what is modified, melodically, harmonically, and rhythmically. The internal structure of the phrase is broken down so you can grasp how a three note motif is used as two short fragments followed by a more connected second half of the phrase. Intervallic tension and use of texture help you to engage further with the Brahms style as we consider what makes this such a beautifully expressive piece. Useful for anyone wanting to grasp key aspects of the Brahms style or who wants to develop ability in analysis. Also useful for composers wanting to write in an expressive Romantic style. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Av1k3lvLqVjJtIGHj3WmWo8BptsXkv5B/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how did Brahms compose?\n0:24 - Playing the piece\n2:14 - Melodic design\n8:31 - Harmonic choices\n15:37 - Other features\n17:45 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Mathematically it appears that 3/4 and 3/8 are two very different time signatures. Musically they are closer to each other than might appear to be the case. 3/8 is often misinterpreted as a Compound time when it is actually a Simple time. Reasons for a composer to choose between 3/4 and 3/8 are investigated. In this music theory lesson the detail of this is unpacked and examples played that demonstrate the essential differences. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the difference between 3/4 and 3/8 time signatures\n1:35 - The theory behind time signatures\n6:27 - How can you tell the difference?\n8:12 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

The difference between these and more common modes is explained, along with an explanation of how each mode has a particular number of possible transpositions. The patterns of intervals within each mode is unpacked along with an explanation of how Messiaen creates groups of notes within each mode. This music theory lesson then takes you through each mode and we explore which notes and intervals are used in each. A fascinating exploration for anyone wanting to understand more fully the melodic and harmonic basis of Messiaen\u2019s music and a very helpful resource for composers wanting to explore this direction in your own music. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/165Y7QIsCehRNXv5kHD7T9PjN7LTBJllC/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Messiaen's Modes of Limited Transposition\n3:15 - First mode (whole tone)\n5:01 - Understanding the limited transposition\n6:28 - Second mode (octatonic)\n8:24 - Third mode\n10:33 - Fourth mode\n11:49 - Fifth mode\n13:16 - Sixth mode\n14:46 - Seventh mode\n15:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson will give you real confidence in using second inversion chords well. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1bKfhG1L1c7r_nusAH90LhhW3NT8FGrU1/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using 6-4 5-3 chord progressions\n1:38 - Why are second inversion chords unstable?\n3:08 - Passing 6-4's\n4:40 - When should you use second inversion chords?\n6:00 - Cadential 6-4's\n6:32 - Examples of using 6-4 5-3 chord progressions\n10:46 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson explains the best ways to write approach chords to Neapolitan chords and the best ways to resolve them. After explaining how to form Neapolitan chords in a major key, the resolution chords are considered before going on to consider the merits or otherwise of each of the diatonic chords as approach chords. Part writing issues are illustrated and potential traps are investigated in relation to parallel 5ths & 8ves, doubling of major 3rds, and false relations, which easily create difficulties in relation to progressions involving Neapolitan chords.

The melodic design is explained alongside the rich harmony, which features extended and chromatic chords. In particular, we consider how Rachmaninoff builds the melody out of a simple three note motif then extends the phrases into longer arches. We then consider how the repeated quavers of the right hand accompaniment drives the music forwards while the left hand provides a long sustained line that also provides secondary melodic interest. The vocal line is sung without words adding colour to the whole in this beautifully expressive work. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14NsHGqg82EQCRnSv_DdliHJnPoNk3Pz2/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Rachmaninoff's lyrical use of motif\n1:08 - Playing the piece\n2:23 - Use of motif in the melodic line\n6:37 - The piano accompaniment\n9:56 - Harmonic analysis\n16:12 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star harmonized in four different styles, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and 20th Century. In the first style the melody is presented as a Cantus Firmus in Baroque style with two lower parts added below using Baroque figuration. The second presentation comes in Classical style featuring a simple texture and harmonic structure using typical Classical period features such as Alberti Bass, turns and appoggiaturas. A full-blooded Romantic version follows employing much chromatic harmony and thick piano texture. To finish is a version in Cool Swing style making plenty of use of extended chords along with melodic decoration and tritone substitution. Useful for composers, arrangers, and for those wanting to gain insight into these different musical styles. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/12jSSoQDr7c36z5zXKEAqD9oiBPt6Y-Z9/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star harmonized in 4 different styles\n1:02 - Playing the four versions\n2:54 - Baroque style composition choices\n6:06 - Playing the Baroque version\n6:24 - Classical style composition choices\n9:43 - Playing the Classical version\n10:01 - Romantic style composition choices\n21:41 - Playing the Romantic version\n22:49 - 20th Century style composition choices\n27:10 - Playing the 20th Century version\n27:30 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This video takes a look at one of his Chorales in which some rules are broken in order to achieve a better musical effect. Join us as we examine the choice of harmony and modulation, the part writing, the use of accented and unaccented passing notes, plus other features of the Bach Chorale style. Useful for anyone wanting to improve their ability to write harmony, to analyse harmony, or to understand the detail of Bach\u2019s style.

      "description": "How do you use Neapolitan chords in? How does a Neapolitan sixth chord resolve? What are the best approach chords to use before a Neapolitan? This music composition lesson explains the best ways to write approach chords to Neapolitan chords and the best ways to resolve them. After explaining how to form Neapolitan chords in a minor key, the resolution chords are considered before going on to consider the merits or otherwise of each of the diatonic chords as approach chords. Part writing issues are illustrated and potential traps are investigated in relation to parallel 5ths & 8ves, doubling of major 3rds, and false relations, which easily create difficulties in relation to progressions involving Neapolitan chords. A useful video for people wanting to work with chromatic chords. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/18GIu19EdPKIqmRd11KEEJb-3HA-Iyi3m/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to  how to use Neapolitan chords in minor keys\n2:08 - Building a Neapolitan chord in a minor key\n3:47 - Neapolitan resolutions\n5:28 - Neapolitan approach chords\n5:54 - Example 1\n6:32 - Example 2\n7:17 - Example 3\n9:49 - Example 4\n12:00 - Example 5\n14:09 - Example 6\n15:35 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

The more common progressions are included alongside some less often used progressions, which are nevertheless effective.

      "description": "How Grieg builds musical character in \u201cWedding Day at Troldhaugen\u201d, number 6 of his op.65 Lyric Pieces written in celebration of his own 25th wedding anniversary. The celebratory character is explored through the tonality, the articulation, the tempo, the repeated rhythmic patterns, and the spirited melodic design. The main thematic contrasts are explained with the much more reflective central section expressed through a slower tempo, a legato approach, lower dynamics and the intimacy of a melodic conversation between the hands, perhaps designed to represent husband and wife in dialogue. This composer insights lesson draws out some of Grieg\u2019s key stylistic characteristics and illustrates how to paint a musical picture of an evocative title. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14jnHpKj9Zjdcw4Qk-gku-Xv91yuAbdjE/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how Edvard Grieg builds character\n0:37 -  Playing the piece\n0:57 - Analysing the initial opening ideas\n7:00 - Developing the music\n10:36 - Celebratory character\n11:48 - Recurring ideas in the second section\n15:35 - Reflective contrast\n19:22 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Domenico Scarlatti wrote over 550 single-movement sonatas for the harpsichord, making characteristic but innovative use of the instrument. This composer insights lesson explores sonata K208 in A major. Having clarified the Binary structure that typifies Scarlatti\u2019s approach we then explore the singing melodic line that is assigned to the right hand, including the melodic shape, the rhythmic design (including syncopation), and the use of appoggiatura ornamentation. The purpose of the left hand is then investigated, including its purpose in providing a driving pulse, the harmonic content, and some embellishment through suspensions. The resulting style is very different from that of Bach or Handel, who were both born in the same year as Scarlatti, but it remains a Baroque style that is most expressive and individual. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15Shh31SM86V2T5y6OqOi0_GIibwkyJ5j/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Domenico Scarlatti's sonatas\n1:29 - Playing the piece\n2:40 - Historic context\n3:11 - Left hand accompaniment\n5:03 - Melodic right hand\n12:38 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "A journey through the hit song \u201cKilling me softly\u201d in order to work out what makes it such a success. We look at the design of the melody and how one phrase relates to another. We also examine the rhythmic structure and the colourful chordal scheme. Unpredictable features are drawn out as well as the elements that give the song a sense of cohesion. Through the study we discover how the song generates and releases musical tension to match perfectly the emotional mood of the song and how the surprise ending works so well. Ideal for those wanting to unpack what makes this song work and to those wanting to compose their own songs. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17GZp3PkC1S6vv7IxdGoo7pjaz1VvWXr8/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Charles Fox's Killing Me Softly, why was it a hit?\n2:22 - Use of chords and harmony\n9:01 -  Melodic design\n15:14 - Further harmonic analysis\n17:38 - Rhythmic character\n18:06 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Why a German 6th sounds exactly the same as a Dominant 7th but functions very differently. This music theory lesson shows you how to construct a Dominant 7th in the key of Db and a German 6th in the key of C, drawing attention to the enharmonic differences. It explains the rules of engagement for resolving the two chords, showing how the Dominant 7th resolves in Db and how the German 6th resolves in C and then demonstrates how the two chords can interchange. A useful video for analysts, composers and performers alike. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the difference between a german 6th and a dominant 7th\n0:38 - The initial difference\n1:58 - Building a dominant 7th chord\n2:46 - Building a German 6th chord\n4:33 - The important differences in their function\n12:35 - Enharmonics and creative uses\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "An insight into the orchestration and harmonic language contained within Holst\u2019s \u201cVenus - the bringer of peace\u201d from his Suite \u2018The Planets\u2019. Holst makes an original and colourful combination of a Horn solo with 4 Flutes and 3 Oboes, repeated with Flutes and Clarinets, all using a mostly non-functional chord language that has much in common with the French Impressionist style of Debussy and Ravel. While there is an underlying sense of Eb major other chords are used, often at phrase endings, that contradict the base key. This composer insights lesson offers a taste of the Holst style and insight into this remarkably evocative work. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17SgKjoZBcsgrVYXskP3tWjiTqWOlBViv/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Holst's use of Impressionist colour\n1:20 - Playing the piece\n2:11 - Orchestration\n4:03 - Harmonic language\n14:15 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music performance lesson considers the broad benefits of singing for our mental, physical, and emotional health then goes on to explain how singing is every musician\u2019s first instrument in the sense that singing was the earliest musical experience most of us enjoyed. The physical aspects are clarified relating to the connection between the voice and the ears and the benefits for improving pitching and relative pitch are explored. Barriers to singing are identified, including being tone deaf, or inexperienced in singing, or breaking voices for teenage boys, or reluctance to sing, or reticent tone. The benefits to expression in instrumental playing are also considered by using the voice to feel the shape of a phrase, learning how to breathe at phrase endings and much more.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to why every musician should be a singer too\n1:10 - Physical and emotional health\n2:47 - Your first instrument\n3:43 - The voice is your own instrument\n7:03 - Expressive benefits\n13:11 - Are you really tone deaf?\n14:45 - Common barriers to singing\n17:20 - Responding to these barriers\n22:38 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Journey through the opening of George Shearing\u2019s \u201cLullaby of Birdland\u201d. What makes his compositional approach so successful? We look at the design of the melody and how one phrase relates to another. We also examine the rhythmic structure and Shearing\u2019s colourful use of extended chords. Unpredictable features are drawn out as well as the elements that give the song a sense of cohesion. Through the study we discover how Shearing generates and releases musical tension to match perfectly the emotional mood of the song. Ideal for those wanting to unpack what makes this song work and to those wanting to compose their own songs. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/15SygHF0Gnk0FFrvBgRrhGu4EuFg3BIs-/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to \n0:59 - Melodic and harmonic design\n13:44 - Rhythmic character\n15:08 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

One unusual feature of Sonata Form is examined and the sophistication of the piece is placed in the context of the simplicity of Mozart\u2019s approach. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/170d9D8UjFmWh6nXMPjXuH9b3duSDjof6/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Mozart the master of simplicity\n0:56 - Playing the piece\n1:25 - Sonata from structure\n3:16 - First theme\n4:01 - Second theme\n4:51 - Development\n7:11 - Recapitulation\n11:48 - Analysis of inner workings\n15:42 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In particular, there is a focus on how to use common notes (common tones) to maintain stability in the part writing when moving from one chord to the next. The video illustrates how to use the nearest available note when a common note is not available. By following this guidance your part writing will quickly improve and you will discover how effective is this approach in avoiding breaking the advisory \u2018rules\u2019 of harmony. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1GbPakk486kmN8kwGtY4YrNGr7yTCIyeP/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using a common note in harmony\n1:53 - Original passage\n8:18 - Refining the music with common notes\n11:52 - Using nearby notes\n17:25 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "An analysis of Op.79 no.2 G minor Rhapsody by Brahms. It takes Brahms a considerable number of bars to establish the home key and meanwhile he travels through a range of other keys. The melodic line is explored, including the growth of the line from the opening four note figure, alongside the bold bass line in octaves featuring wide leaps, while the middle of the texture features agitated triplets. The threads of the texture combine with a turbulent harmonic language to create the rhapsodic mood. All reveals the distinctive style of Brahms. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/157OMqBgazROgVyvjtRtRb9krBtTZowuw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to rhapsodic Brahms\n0:47 - Playing the piece\n1:19 - Personal memory of playing this piece\n3:21 - Analysing the music\n14:47 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Step inside the mind of Beethoven as we explore the features that make the opening movement so memorable, including the hypnotic impact of the triplet accompaniment figure, the distinctive nature of the melodic line with its repeated notes and dotted rhythms, as well as the twists and turns that keep the listener engaged in the harmony. All of this sits in the context of the unexpected Adagio opening movement but above all, Beethoven makes an emotional impact that is immediately engaging and continually draws us back to this iconic movement. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lcywj4DZjMoFcIyTQgp_TYDdjM_PETJw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what makes Moonlight Sonata so popular?\n1:08 - History behind the piece\n1:37 - What makes it different?\n2:01 - Playing the piece\n2:40 - Tempo and metre\n3:41 - Opening atmosphere\n11:25 - Melodic design\n17:32 - Unexpected harmonic choices\n22:13 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "This music composition lesson unpacks Bach\u2019s Sinfonia in B minor, drawing attention to the three motifs used to compose this piece. The three motifs are unpacked and we explore both the differences and the common ground between them. We then journey through the work and discover how these ideas are used in sequence, curtailed, presented in conversation between parts, and combined in various ways. The video gives insight into this piece, into Bach\u2019s style, and into how to write a piece using three motifs. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17NTiLPWaO0otZOqK9rbQNgeWiPA-heM4/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how motifs are used in Baroque style\n1:09 - Playing the example piece\n1:30 - First motivic idea\n4:51 - Contrasting left hand motif\n7:51 - A third motif\n9:13 - How Bach uses these motifs\n26:44 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In particular we explore how rhythm and modulation are used to create drama. Starting with the fast repeated quavers of the opening, this video explains how this drives the energy of the movement in conjunction with the semiquaver runs and other rhythmic features. You will also be taken on Beethoven\u2019s fascinating journey through a panoply of keys, including many unexpected twists and turns. The video offers insight into how this piece works and into how Beethoven writes and also inspires ideas for composers wanting to write with drama and energy. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_aGpzC6SPqY1Sm1nwjmxHhjgEcs5o4j/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to achieving drama through rhythm and modulation\n2:46 - Playing the piece\n3:31 - The drama of Beethoven\n14:12 - Development of ideas\n20:22 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "This music theory lesson explains how to effect radical modulation by using just a single note. By using a single pivot note, rather than a pivot chord, it is possible to modulate to distant keys without making the music sound strange. We work through an example together in which, in the space of a small number of bars, we modulate from F major to Db major to A major. This is an incredibly useful trick for composers to learn and for analysts to discover. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1MPxJOXNDbAzz7gMFv38chAIN3l5iaadz/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how to change key with one note\n0:20 - Playing the piece\n0:32 - Key scheme\n1:17 - Pivot chords\n4:23 - Explaining the process\n5:45 - Enharmonic conversions\n7:43 - Tips for use\n8:15 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This composer insights lesson begins by examining the melodic line in the right hand. Through much of the piece the melody does little more than alternate two notes but is interspersed with more elaborate melodic and rhythmic movement. An examination of the harmony reveals a piece full of chromatic colour that paints the poetic twists and turns of this stunning Prelude. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBqZ79wKoef7jI2v8KCDdbk0sUTLDWOY/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to hallmarks of Chopin's poetic style\n0:26 - Playing the piece\n0:48 - Background and context\n2:35 - Features of the overall design\n3:35 - Why the simple melody?\n13:18 - The importance of the harmony\n22:25 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "What is doubling the major third? How do you know if it's a major third? Can you double thirds? Why is doubling a major third bad? This music composition lesson explains one of the rules of writing four-part harmony, namely the advice to avoid doubling major chords, and goes on to explain how to identify them in a piece of music. When writing four part harmony, particular attention should be paid to the use of thirds in chords. Thirds should normally be included but, while minor thirds can be doubled, the advice is to avoid the doubling of major thirds. We present a passage of four-part harmony that includes quite a number of chords which infringe the rule and show you how to identify the doubled major thirds and how to alter the layout of chords to correct the problem. Useful for all engaged in the writing of harmony. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWKzn1H02EagEMbV7enWqB2awxs4JXgg/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to identifying double major thirds\n1:52 - Why is doubling major thirds supposed to be bad?\n5:37 - How do you identify major thirds?\n7:31 - Spotting double major thirds in a piece\n17:06 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson gives you plenty of options for chords that progress well from that starting point. This video shows you how the chord progressions work in major keys, and explores how root position chords might integrate well with occasional inversion chords. The more common progressions are included alongside some less often used progressions, which are nevertheless effective. Some progressions work well at the start of a phrase, others at the end of the phrase, while others would work best mid-phrase.

      "description": "Are you struggling to get started in writing a chord progression? If you want to use chord VII what are the best options for chords to follow? This music composition lesson gives you plenty of options for chords that progress well from that starting point. This video shows you how the chord progressions work in minor keys, and explores how root position chords might integrate well with occasional inversion chords. The more common progressions are included alongside some less often used progressions, which are nevertheless effective. Some progressions work well at the start of a phrase, others at the end of the phrase, while others would work best mid-phrase. If you\u2019re a composer looking for ideal chord progressions this video is for you.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the best chords to follow chord VII in minor keys\n0:15 - Using the harmonic minor\n1:17 - How chords work\n4:29 - Inversion chords\n5:45 - What's the point of this video?\n6:17 - Working through the example progressions\n12:51 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music theory lesson looks at the different ways of calculating the notes needed in a pentatonic scale then considers the makeup of the major pentatonic and the minor pentatonic scale.

The characteristics of the initial idea are considered from the perspectives of melodic and rhythmic design & harmonic implication. The video then demonstrates how to use the initial idea as a point of imitation throughout a passage scored for String Trio. Then the free parts are added showing how to vary the texture and to use ingredients of the main idea alongside chord tones and non chord tones.

      "description": "This famous work was hardly played between the death of Pachelbel and a revival of the piece during the 1960\u2019s, since when it has been performed throughout the world in many contexts and new arrangements. This music appreciation lesson explores the repeated bass line (the ostinato) and repeated chord pattern that goes on throughout the piece following a pattern known as the Romanesca. The bass and chord pattern repeats 28 times while a series of 12 variations unfold above the bass in the three violin parts, which are presented in canon. Besides providing background and context to this famous Canon in D, the work is unpacked and analysed before covering a number of modern songs that embrace Pachelbel\u2019s Romanesca pattern. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/18TTvfwYN5s8lqiOBR-C8MBGgi0J2UP6L/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Pachelbel and his canon\n0:32 - Background of the piece\n2:32 - How the Basso Continuo worked\n6:00 - What is a musical canon?\n7:46 - What's a chaconne?\n8:19 - When and why was the canon written?\n15:31 - The ostinato bass line\n18:05 - Analysis of the chords\n20:34 - Romanesca pattern\n22:23 - Structure of the work\n25:57 - Variations of the melodic patterns\n29:56 - Modern music influenced by Pachelbel's canon\n31:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "This music performance lesson explores the essentials required in the delivery of scales and arpeggios then explains the finer points that can be applied in scales and arpeggios in order to generate superb technical control and musical sensitivity. Beyond the accurate delivery of notes, rhythm and fingering, we consider the use of tone, dynamics and articulation. We also consider how to achieve shape through dynamic control, how to play one hand louder than the other, how to play legato in one hand and staccato in the other, as well as other techniques that can be honed through scale and arpeggio playing. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to playing scales better on the piano\n2:30 - Coordination and accuracy \n4:09 - Quality of tone\n5:10 - Playing a smooth legato\n6:45 - Playing a good staccato\n8:50 - Adding musical shape\n9:40 - Hand balance\n10:33 - Opposite articulations\n11:14 - Different rhythms\n11:37 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Colour in music can mean a number of different things. Some musicians experience Synesthesia in which particular notes, keys or chords are experienced directly in relation to particular colours. We talk about the Blues or about white noise, both terms that raise a reference to colour. The video expands on the above then goes on to explore colour in relation to chords, different textures, and to the varying colours available between one instrument or voice and another, and within the ranges of particular instruments or voices. The impact of dynamics, articulation, particular playing techniques, sound waves and instrument design all play their part in contributing to the colour and consequent emotional impact of a score. This music appreciation lesson explores the topic from the perspectives of the listener, the performer and the composer. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what is colour in music?\n3:11 - Instrumental colours\n10:34 - How does colour influence a composition\n11:52 - Varying the colour of sound\n15:59 - Why is colour in music important?\n16:34 - Describing tone colour\n17:32 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

We learn how Recitative was born and how Opera gradually developed from there to containing Arias, Choruses, Ballet, orchestral movements and the other features that make up Opera. We learn about the evolution of Opera Seria and Opera Buffa and how Italian Opera grew within and outside the Italian border.

The Baroque orchestra could be anything from small ensembles to surprisingly large instrumental groups. Some of the instruments are familiar to us but other instruments fell out of use, while other instruments were developed in new ways beyond the Baroque.

      "description": "See why every musician should become familiar with figured bass. For harpsichordists and organists needing to realise figured bass in performance realising figured bass fluently with style is essential. For others it\u2019s a useful way of understanding the mind of the Baroque composer. It\u2019s also a helpful way of thinking about music from the bass upwards rather than the more usual approach from the top downwards. Additionally figured bass helps to think about chords in terms of intervals above the bass line. Being able to think fluently between thinking chords in roman numerals, in lead sheet presentation, and in figured bass is the most helpful way of understanding harmony from multiple perspectives. So figured bass is for all. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1V5YihcnmDsxje9RY9VmyDTp0P7bcqI/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to why learn figured bass?\n3:35 - Explanation of how the figured bass system works\n9:31 - Seventh chords\n14:12 - Accidentals\n15:51 - Suspensions\n21:56 - Ways to play figured bass\n25:22 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This video will be helpful to anyone wanting to improve their harmony and to anyone wanting to harmonise Chorales in the style of Bach. The video covers modulations and cadences, explores ways of working backwards as well as forwards, considers how to use common notes between one chord and the next, thinks out writing a bass line predominately in contrary motion with the given melody, suggests harmonic alternatives and how to evaluate the best choice in any given situation, considers how to achieve melodic integrity in each of the lines, adds colour and movement through devices such as secondary dominants and inessential notes, and explores how touches of counterpoint can be incorporated even in such a homophonic structure. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LvTWo0ACTGnXPb6wBhqY9aoZ2BCLtHJh/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Bach's four-part writing\n1:20 - Musical phrases\n1:56 - Keys and modulations\n5:10 - Starting with the cadences\n8:06 - Playing the melody with the cadences\n8:32 - Filling out the cadences\n16:33 - Adding chords to first phrase\n25:21 - The first complete phrase\n26:41 - Adding chords to second phrase\n32:46 - Playing the completed chorale\n33:16 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson begins with a bass line and considers the best way to select chords to fit it. He then demonstrates how to write a melodic top line that fits with the harmony, that acts well alongside the bass line, and also works well as a melody. We consider the shape and direction of the melody along with the balance between conjunct and disjunct movement and the rhythmic character that can be achieved. Finally the middle parts are completed in a way that achieves as much stability as possible. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBZLk5npZVPvPNNtNR5AumB_fstzR3me/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to four-part harmony from a bass line\n1:31 - Explaining the exercise\n1:53 - Choosing the chords that work best\n11:23 - Designing a good melodic line\n17:34 - Filling in the alto and tenor lines\n23:17 - Getting a strong melodic line \n24:28 - Playing the finished piece\n24:38 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Many people struggle to know how to harmonize repeated notes. This music composition explores three strategies for dealing with such situations by harmonising the same note repeated six times. The first strategy is to consider the three diatonic chords that fit with the given note. The second strategy is to consider how to balance root position chords with inversion chords. The third strategy is to consider how to decorate the harmony with inessential notes and suspensions. A combination of these approaches ensures that repeated notes in the melodic line do not result in static harmony and a lack of progression. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xu4tj35i6i78oOIAeP-8OkZ0NcW9vmnE/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how to harmonize repeated notes\n0:54 - An example of a melody with repeated notes\n1:54 - The simple solution\n3:44 - Thinking about a better solution\n5:54 - Choosing the chords and inversions\n8:46 - A more interesting cadence\n10:02 - Filling in the alto and tenor parts\n12:55 - Adding passing notes\n13:40 - Thinking dominant seventh chords\n15:06 - Switching notes between parts\n15:38 - Incorporating a suspension\n18:05 - Decorating the suspension\n19:06 - Hints of a chord III\n21:14 - How does it all work together?\n21:54 - Playing the final harmonization\n22:02 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In particular, we discover how Bach uses a number of unresolved dominant 7ths back to back, making this a radical approach for Baroque times. Discover what Bach is doing and how successfully it works. We also take a look at the choice of harmony, the part writing, dealing with harmonic and melodic minor, plus other features of the Bach Chorale style. Useful for anyone wanting to improve their ability to write harmony, to analyse harmony, or to understand the detail of Bach\u2019s style.

      "description": "We consider the possibilities for using chord V as either a major or a minor chord. In the harmonic minor context used by most composers since 1600 chord V is always major but in the context of the descending melodic minor scale and in the natural minor scale chord V is minor. This music composition lesson explains when you would want to use V as a major chord or as a minor chord and considers the best approach and resolution chords. By the end of the video you will have a clear understanding of when and how to use chord V as a major or a minor chord. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1AAICWiNPzRrQOQQtUvvyZe0I1lw0ADd1/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using minor 5 chords\n0:23 - Dominant chords in a key\n1:19 - Harmony with the harmonic minor scale\n5:36 - Writing in the natural minor\n7:05 - Melodic minor scale similarities\n8:54 - Example one\n13:08 - Example two\n14:45 - Example three\n16:45 - Example four\n18:48 - Example five\n21:26 - Some other possible resolutions for minor 5\n23:52 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson takes a set of five notes and considers ideas for composing or improvising a piece based on those notes. We then explore how the Australian composer, Peter Sculthorpe uses this pitch set as the basis for a short piano piece. Having seen how the pitch set is used and repeated with different rhythms we examine other features of Sculthorpe\u2019s piece such as the use of pedal and low dynamics, as well as his permutations of the five note set.

      "description": "Discover how Alberti Bass works and how useful it is in breathing energy into accompaniments. Often composers write a successful melody but the accompaniment is limited to block chords. Using Alberti Bass is one way of liberating the accompaniment and even though this is a Classical period device it can be applied in music of other genres. This music composition lesson will assist composers and will also help performers recognise the use of Alberti Bass in the music they are playing. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16Oyx5ZxA3fMMOM5LxXVYz_8nrPkL6psT/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using Alberti bass as a compositional technique\n1:37 - Why is it called an Alberti bass?\n2:21 - What do we do when we use an Alberti bass?\n3:35 - Working the exercise\n7:38 - Playing the finished piece\n8:11 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Starting with the melodic line we discover how the contour works and how the phrase design enhances the rises and falls in musical tension. We then consider how the harmony supports the melody and how the figuration of the accompaniment plays a significant role. This composer insights lesson illustrates how these elements are combined through the genius of Schubert. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1AEr5DM5EuQVuGIrbWduKAkwuD48Z_End/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how Schubert creates emotion\n1:50 - Playing the piece\n2:40 - Melody\n8:16 - Harmony\n21:16 - Texture and design\n25:09 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Discover how Josquin des Prez developed compositional style during the High Renaissance period. Josquin des Prez followed composers like Du Fay and Ockeghem, and prepared the ground for Palestrina and his contemporaries. As a singer, much of his output is choral, including the secular Chanson. Most of his writing comprised sacred repertoire, such as Mass settings, and his most significant contribution came in the form of the Motet. His style is often homophonic but also frequently imitative. He was also one of the first composers to engage with word painting and with a less melismatic approach. This music appreciation lesson explores an overview of Josquin\u2019s music and the key features of his style, particularly through the window of the Motet. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWNiJ8_NFe4EjW2Ml9gHLzuQ3-FN1l4k/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Josquin Des Prez high Renaissance motets\n3:02 - His contribution to music\n7:43 -  What was Josqiuin about?\n11:09 - Domine ne in furore\n14:26 - Writing style and technique\n21:19 - Psalm text settings\n25:54 - An example of one of his motets\n26:48 - Analysing the music\n32:09 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

There is another more delicate, elegant side to Beethoven\u2019s musical personality that has roots in the Classical period. Step inside the mind of Beethoven as we explore the opening of his Op 49 G minor Sonata and unpacks the various aspects of this more delicate style. We examine the melodic design, the ingenious phrase structure and balance, the delicate textures, the using of figuration and ornamentation and the simple but beautifully crafted harmonic structure.

      "description": "We investigate a less familiar corner of Rossini\u2019s writing, namely the Preludio Religioso from his Petite Messe. Unusually, the movement is written for Harmonium. This composer insights lesson goes on to explore the initial fugal design and then considers how this breaks down in favour of a more homophonic texture and a structure which allows for cadential stopping points. We explore Rossini\u2019s use of sequence and how he develops the initial fugal ideas. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1AF49YasE4LxJEXuJN8p_acKYMB93WZdz/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Rossini's writing for the harmonium\n1:16 - What is a harmonium?\n2:36 - A little bit of fugato\n8:55 - Hybrid textures breaking into four parts\n11:25 - Moving through keys and use of sequance\n15:45 - A return of the fugato ideas\n18:18 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "A clever little music composition technique for you to try in your next piece. This music composition lesson begins with a reminder of how to extend triads to 7th chords in the conventional manner. It then goes on to consider an alternative way of introducing 7th chords by adding a note at the bottom of the chord rather than at the top. The result produces a way of starting with one chord, then using every note of the chord as common notes in forming the 7th of another chord. It\u2019s a great way of creating strong chord progressions and this video will be especially helpful to composers and arrangers. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BZd8tUA32TcSvHvyo35pCnnztSeI7e38/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to upside down 7th chords\n0:21 - Building 7th chords\n2:48 - What are upside down chords?\n4:56 - Using chords upside down\n8:15 - Chord I example progression\n8:45 - Chord II example progression\n9:26 - Chord II example progression\n10:06 - Chord V example progression\n10:31 - Chord VI example progression\n10:55 - Chord VII example progression\n11:42 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Discover how to transform a piece of music that is using block chords into a much more engaging presentation with a moving bass line. Taking the opening of the British National Anthem this music composition lesson demonstrates how to keep the bass line moving by adding passing notes/ passing tones, auxiliary notes/ neighbour notes, by moving to other harmony notes/ chord tones. It then demonstrates how chromatic embellishment of the bass line can add colour to what otherwise might be a rather plain piece of music. This video will help musicians to understand more fully what is going on in much of the music they play and will empower composers wanting to transform something ordinary into something much more creative and engaging. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTw4UrP_tb5pOdcPjxAvM8DGVnsLj3bm/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to creating a moving bass line\n0:34 - Playing the piece\n1:15 - Techniques you can use\n3:11 - Working on the bass line\n16:29 - Playing the original version\n16:56 - Playing the adapted version\n17:21 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Many composers and students of harmony worry about harmonising repeated notes in a melody. Repeated notes can make for melodic stagnation and the remedy is often to create harmonic interest but how is this achieved? This music theory lesson goes through how to select the three diatonic chords that can be interchanged while a melody note is repeated, and explains how to use inversion chords in this context. He then explains how to use chromatic chords and secondary dominants to enrich the result further. In the example worked through during this video no fewer than eight repeated notes occur back to back in the melodic line yet the harmony is hugely varied. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1HhLdFxjfeCiAGG1hDD_oxJcMIRVu0WEk/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how to vary the harmony for repeated notes\n0:36 - A straightforward way to solve the issue\n2:34 - The point of this video\n3:25 - Playing the example\n4:02 - Working through the example piece\n15:51 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "This music theory lesson summarises the rule of the octave and explains how it offers insight into harmonic thinking and into Baroque harmony in particular. The rule of the octave begins with the notion of harmonising an octave of the scale in the bass using first inversion chords. We learn how the pattern is modified progressively through starting and ending with the tonic chord in root position, then employing the dominant chord in root position, then by preceding each tonic and dominant chord with a 7th chord. This pattern is explored in major and minor keys. The rule of the octave explains many of the harmonic progressions that are still regarded as strong today. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1kzNOENWNin5bhyVpdsg2l_x9TjedpxYL/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to who needs the rule of the octave?\n0:50 - The root position chord problem\n2:30 - Harmonizing with first inversion chords\n4:13 - Mixing root position and first inversion chords\n5:54 - The creation of standard chord progressions\n6:49 - Further modification\n8:50 - Why a balance of harmony is important\n9:57 - Incorporating seventh chords\n11:58 - The creation of pre-dominant seventh chords\n13:44 - Applying this to minor keys\n17:07 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

The video goes on to illustrate how chromatic alternation to notes can evolve the same pattern through different keys. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1sZZJ64_H-QpvVzL6OVdNy0Cr5vWsghko/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to harmonic sequences\n1:28 - The circle of fifths\n2:44 - Organising a bass line\n4:34 - Playing the first version\n4:41 - Analysing the basic progression\n6:36 - Using flats to move through keys\n7:09 - Playing the second version\n7:19 - Comparing versions\n7:40 - Analysing the second progression\n8:23 - Moderating key movement with just one accidental\n8:55 - Playing the third version\n9:03 - Analysing the third version\n9:37 - Playing and comparing all three versions\n10:05 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In this lesson we examine the linear implications for part writing using the chord scheme presented by the rule of the octave, with one voice centred around the tonic, another centred around the third, and yet another centred around the fifth. The video covers the logic behind the choice of melodic notes then goes on to show how the parts are combined in the first, second and third positions. Ascending and descending patterns are covered, along with examples in both major and minor keys. This video offers insight into harmonic thinking that will illuminate Baroque style and the writing of harmony more broadly. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tNKI6mCaOnHmjYqOG6rHA734t5E5A6bi/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what to do with the rule of the octave\n0:40 - Centre on the tonic\n6:18 - Centre on the third\n8:52 - Centre on the fifth\n10:30 - Putting parts together\n11:40 - Upper parts in first position\n11:51 - Upper parts in second position\n11:59 - Upper parts in third position\n12:06 - Importance of linear direction but with harmonic thinking\n13:04 - Descending\n13:45 - Centre on the tonic\n14:56 - Centre on the third\n16:08 - Centre on the fifth\n17:33 - Putting parts together\n17:51 - Upper parts in first position\n18:01 - Upper parts in second position\n18:10 - Upper parts in third position\n18:19 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Many people find it easier to harmonise an ascending scale than a descending scale and most people find it easier to harmonise a scale at the top of the texture than at the bottom. In this case, we examine a neat and sequential way of harmonising a descending scale in the bass by alternating root position and first inversion chords. This also neatly avoids generating any parallels. These kind of structures are useful for composers working in any genre. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQx7usrPlYbUe_JtLo4SLLbbCvLSzjrm/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to alternating inversion chords when harmonizing a descending bass\n1:08 - Voice leading\n2:12 - Common mistakes\n2:59 - Solution\n6:22 - Alternative version\n6:59 - Making it more interesting\n10:37 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Descending scales in the bass can be awkward to harmonise satisfactorily without generating parallels. This pattern illustrates one way of handling the situation in a way that is musically interesting and which activates an engaging use of musical tension. These kind of structures are useful for composers working in any genre and are especially for building bridges or other connections between musical ideas. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpoqsQGc9Yn1Mrxa5cK6Kof6bRBgJiU3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using suspensions to harmonize a descending bass\n1:13 - An example of bad harmony\n2:10 - A way around it using suspensions\n6:12 - Playing the piece\n6:22 - Tension and release effect\n6:57 - An alternative with suspensions in the middle part\n8:07 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

All these threads are pulled together and explore the essential elements that lead us to deciding how to interpret the piece.

Sonata Form serves as the catalyst for honing your composition skills and nurturing your growth as a proficient music creator. This course begins with an explanation of Sonata Form - what it is and how it evolved during the Classical Period. We then analyse Sonata Form movements written by Mozart and Beethoven to discover how Classical Period composers wrote in this structure and in order to see how Sonata Form was to develop during the Romantic Period. The course also explains the possible variants within Sonata Form that composers might choose to explore. There follow two composition projects. In the first, we write the essentials of a Sonata Form movement in the Classical Period style, considering how to compose first and second subjects, how to develop and recapitulate material, when to include an introduction, a Coda and transition material. In the second, we write a more extended Sonata Form movement in a more contemporary style, learning to deal with the challenges of working with Sonata Form in an atonal environment.\nhttps://www.mmcourses.co.uk/p/composing-in-sonata-form-course\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Social Media\nWebsite: http://www.mmcourses.co.uk\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MusicMattersGB\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MusicMattersGB\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/MusicMattersGB\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dvgdUD\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Affiliate Links\nAmazon: https://geni.us/71PKSR\n\n#MusicComposition #LearnMusic #TheAllRoundMusician",

We then consider the implication of using too many non-chord tones when they start to clutter the melodic focus or harmonic activity. We consider the implications of tempo and other factors. An example of over use of non-chord tones is unpacked then a less congested alternative is examined.

Ascending scales in the bass can be awkward to harmonise satisfactorily without generating parallels. This alternating 5-6 pattern illustrates one way of handling the situation in a way that is musically interesting and which activates an engaging use of musical tension. These kind of structures are useful for composers working in any genre and are especially for building bridges or other connections between musical ideas. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1trEqxiAebzkTMynA2TQnnnZb1q-HA44E/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to harmonizing an ascending scale with 5-6 alterations\n1:41 - A simple solution\n7:14 - Playing the piece\n7:48 - Ideas to make it more interesting\n8:11 - Reversing the upper parts\n8:49 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In this music theory lesson we explore which chords are major, which are minor, and which are diminished. We consider how the chord lineup is different from the chord lineup in the harmonic and melodic minors. We go on to observe the harmonisation of a melody in the natural minor and consider how different the music feels when we contrast harmonisations in the natural minor with harmonisations using the harmonic minor. This video will free you up to harmonise with confidence in the natural minor. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10UggO3Q5phpqbyxwUgSaHAew_lEUZPFh/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using chords in the natural minor\n0:14 - Natural minor scales\n1:47 - Other minor scales\n3:28 - Chords in the natural minor scale\n4:39 - Comparing chords in natural to harmonic minor\n9:15 - Simple natural minor harmony\n11:24 - Playing the piece\n11:42 - Comparison with a harmonic minor version\n12:45 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Harmony text books often advise us to avoid using certain chord progressions. Why is that? This music theory lesson explains how the chord progressions under consideration can create difficulties in the part writing with consecutive / parallel fifths and octaves and also explains why the progressions are best avoided at cadence points. We consider the smooth progression of individual voices and how certain progressions create awkward leaps and we hear examples where alternative choices of chords generate more convincing outcomes. The video goes on to demonstrate how to use each of the progressions successfully and explores why style, mood and musical context make an impact on the choice to use these progressions or not. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16cDI7V3tKzjKVuLgLzKXlN5wKf1MKjPw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to 4 chord progressions to avoid\n0:52 - building chords basics\n4:37 - First progression to avoid\n12:23 - Second progression to avoid\n18:00 - Third progression to avoid\n21:18 - Fourth progression to avoid\n24:36 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Join us and discover the harmonic series, or overtone series. This music theory lesson begins with a fundamental note and explains how to derive the overtones from that note that comprise the harmonic series. The video uses the principles of brass playing as a guide to how it all works and lists the first 16 notes of a harmonic series based on C as a fundamental note. We go on to learn how the valves and the slide work on brass instruments in order to capture every semitone / half step of the chromatic scale by combining different transpositions of the harmonic series. We also discover how these overtones enrich the sound of the fundamental note. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16xTkEVtlnby3j7SBR2ucNl2uG4xD4A55/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the harmonic series explained\n0:52 - Practical thinking\n4:12 - History of the harmonic series\n6:19 - Notes of the harmonic series\n8:16 - Resonant overtones\n9:11 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "We begin with a reminder of what is a pentatonic scale and how a pentatonic scale can be transposed. We go on to hear and look at a short melody written in C major pentatonic before comparing that with another melody written in A minor pentatonic. We see and hear how the tonic of the two melodies differs and how that enables us to define the melody as major pentatonic or minor pentatonic. This music theory lesson will be useful to those playing in major pentatonic and minor pentatonic and will also help those who are writing in major and minor pentatonic. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16i9WWjjd1BWUDwmF2ogOrAsJSRMB2ciR/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the difference between major and minor pentatonic scales\n0:16 - What is a pentatonic scale?\n1:15 - Major pentatonic scales\n2:27 - Minor pentatonic scales\n3:52 - The difference\n4:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music theory lesson explains why the spelling of notes matters and gets into the reasons why it might be right to choose one spelling of a note over another. We examine a melody and a passage of harmony where correct spellings and incorrect spellings appear. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16t_Fa-wsy5Q_XAPo_hH1f_6aa05Rbe-o/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to why does it matter how we spell musical notes\n0:22 - What are enharmonic equivalents?\n2:58 - Melodic example with some grey areas\n8:44 - Chord based example demonstrating enharmonic harmony\n20:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "You may be someone who is used to using certain chords over and over again or you may be someone who is confident using diatonic chords but who is reluctant to explore more colourful harmony. This lesson explores the impact of 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th chords, covering possibilities for voicing those chords, how one extended chord might best progress to another, how you might impose a melody or a moving bass on an extended chord progression, and different things you could do with the texture. Conventional and less conventional progressions are investigated, along with chromatic alterations to extended notes within the chord. In short this series of videos will open your mind to new possibilities and encourage you to explore more. For many viewers this will be a real game changer. This video belongs to a set of 8 videos focused on using extended chords to create more colourful harmony. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXHE0WT1mS0AjJs2rFXL6tB93siGT_F-/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to cool extended chord progressions\n0:30 - What are extended chords?\n1:40 - The chord progression\n5:10 - Be careful\n6:37 - Using the progression to make music\n7:50 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!
