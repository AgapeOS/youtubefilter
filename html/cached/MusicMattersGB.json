      "description": "A journey through the hit song \u201cKilling me softly\u201d in order to work out what makes it such a success. We look at the design of the melody and how one phrase relates to another. We also examine the rhythmic structure and the colourful chordal scheme. Unpredictable features are drawn out as well as the elements that give the song a sense of cohesion. Through the study we discover how the song generates and releases musical tension to match perfectly the emotional mood of the song and how the surprise ending works so well. Ideal for those wanting to unpack what makes this song work and to those wanting to compose their own songs. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17GZp3PkC1S6vv7IxdGoo7pjaz1VvWXr8/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Charles Fox's Killing Me Softly, why was it a hit?\n2:22 - Use of chords and harmony\n9:01 -  Melodic design\n15:14 - Further harmonic analysis\n17:38 - Rhythmic character\n18:06 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music theory lesson shows you how to construct a Dominant 7th in the key of Db and a German 6th in the key of C, drawing attention to the enharmonic differences. It explains the rules of engagement for resolving the two chords, showing how the Dominant 7th resolves in Db and how the German 6th resolves in C and then demonstrates how the two chords can interchange.

      "description": "An insight into the orchestration and harmonic language contained within Holst\u2019s \u201cVenus - the bringer of peace\u201d from his Suite \u2018The Planets\u2019. Holst makes an original and colourful combination of a Horn solo with 4 Flutes and 3 Oboes, repeated with Flutes and Clarinets, all using a mostly non-functional chord language that has much in common with the French Impressionist style of Debussy and Ravel. While there is an underlying sense of Eb major other chords are used, often at phrase endings, that contradict the base key. This composer insights lesson offers a taste of the Holst style and insight into this remarkably evocative work. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17SgKjoZBcsgrVYXskP3tWjiTqWOlBViv/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Holst's use of Impressionist colour\n1:20 - Playing the piece\n2:11 - Orchestration\n4:03 - Harmonic language\n14:15 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music performance lesson considers the broad benefits of singing for our mental, physical, and emotional health then goes on to explain how singing is every musician\u2019s first instrument in the sense that singing was the earliest musical experience most of us enjoyed. The physical aspects are clarified relating to the connection between the voice and the ears and the benefits for improving pitching and relative pitch are explored. Barriers to singing are identified, including being tone deaf, or inexperienced in singing, or breaking voices for teenage boys, or reluctance to sing, or reticent tone. The benefits to expression in instrumental playing are also considered by using the voice to feel the shape of a phrase, learning how to breathe at phrase endings and much more.\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to why every musician should be a singer too\n1:10 - Physical and emotional health\n2:47 - Your first instrument\n3:43 - The voice is your own instrument\n7:03 - Expressive benefits\n13:11 - Are you really tone deaf?\n14:45 - Common barriers to singing\n17:20 - Responding to these barriers\n22:38 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Journey through the opening of George Shearing\u2019s \u201cLullaby of Birdland\u201d. What makes his compositional approach so successful? We look at the design of the melody and how one phrase relates to another. We also examine the rhythmic structure and Shearing\u2019s colourful use of extended chords. Unpredictable features are drawn out as well as the elements that give the song a sense of cohesion. Through the study we discover how Shearing generates and releases musical tension to match perfectly the emotional mood of the song.

      "description": "An analysis of Op.79 no.2 G minor Rhapsody by Brahms. It takes Brahms a considerable number of bars to establish the home key and meanwhile he travels through a range of other keys. The melodic line is explored, including the growth of the line from the opening four note figure, alongside the bold bass line in octaves featuring wide leaps, while the middle of the texture features agitated triplets. The threads of the texture combine with a turbulent harmonic language to create the rhapsodic mood. All reveals the distinctive style of Brahms. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/157OMqBgazROgVyvjtRtRb9krBtTZowuw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to rhapsodic Brahms\n0:47 - Playing the piece\n1:19 - Personal memory of playing this piece\n3:21 - Analysing the music\n14:47 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Beethoven\u2019s Moonlight Sonata is one of his most famous pieces of music. Most people have heard it and many want to play it. What makes this such a popular work? Step inside the mind of Beethoven as we explore the features that make the opening movement so memorable, including the hypnotic impact of the triplet accompaniment figure, the distinctive nature of the melodic line with its repeated notes and dotted rhythms, as well as the twists and turns that keep the listener engaged in the harmony. All of this sits in the context of the unexpected Adagio opening movement but above all, Beethoven makes an emotional impact that is immediately engaging and continually draws us back to this iconic movement. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lcywj4DZjMoFcIyTQgp_TYDdjM_PETJw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what makes Moonlight Sonata so popular?\n1:08 - History behind the piece\n1:37 - What makes it different?\n2:01 - Playing the piece\n2:40 - Tempo and metre\n3:41 - Opening atmosphere\n11:25 - Melodic design\n17:32 - Unexpected harmonic choices\n22:13 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

We then discover how the composer uses colourful harmony to support the melody and the structure while painting the rises and falls in the emotional life of the piece. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LZ4pWX_wqpGpqqJiyJZ9N49VMy5CD3LY/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Burgmuller's romantic harmony\n0:58 - Playing the piece\n2:05 - Structure\n2:55 - Melodic design\n5:41 - Romantic harmony\n12:22 - Repeated section\n13:23 - A look at the B section\n16:00 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In particular we explore how rhythm and modulation are used to create drama. Starting with the fast repeated quavers of the opening, this video explains how this drives the energy of the movement in conjunction with the semiquaver runs and other rhythmic features. You will also be taken on Beethoven\u2019s fascinating journey through a panoply of keys, including many unexpected twists and turns. The video offers insight into how this piece works and into how Beethoven writes and also inspires ideas for composers wanting to write with drama and energy. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1L_aGpzC6SPqY1Sm1nwjmxHhjgEcs5o4j/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to achieving drama through rhythm and modulation\n2:46 - Playing the piece\n3:31 - The drama of Beethoven\n14:12 - Development of ideas\n20:22 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Following the breakdown of tonality, composers during the earliest years of the 20th century sought new ways in which to write in a post-tonal world. Serialism is one of the most prominent innovations resulting from this. This unique course explains step by step how to write Serial music and provides an extensive outline of twelve-tone compositional techniques, with numerous musical examples and exercises.\nhttps://www.mmcourses.co.uk/p/rhythm-bootcamp-course/\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Social Media\nWebsite: http://www.mmcourses.co.uk\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MusicMattersGB\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MusicMattersGB\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/MusicMattersGB\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dvgdUD\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Affiliate Links\nAmazon: https://geni.us/71PKSR\n\n#MusicComposition #AdvancedMusicTheory #TheAllRoundMusician",

By using a single pivot note, rather than a pivot chord, it is possible to modulate to distant keys without making the music sound strange. We work through an example together in which, in the space of a small number of bars, we modulate from F major to Db major to A major.

This composer insights lesson begins by examining the melodic line in the right hand. Through much of the piece the melody does little more than alternate two notes but is interspersed with more elaborate melodic and rhythmic movement. An examination of the harmony reveals a piece full of chromatic colour that paints the poetic twists and turns of this stunning Prelude. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBqZ79wKoef7jI2v8KCDdbk0sUTLDWOY/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to hallmarks of Chopin's poetic style\n0:26 - Playing the piece\n0:48 - Background and context\n2:35 - Features of the overall design\n3:35 - Why the simple melody?\n13:18 - The importance of the harmony\n22:25 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "What is doubling the major third? How do you know if it's a major third? Can you double thirds? Why is doubling a major third bad? This music composition lesson explains one of the rules of writing four-part harmony, namely the advice to avoid doubling major chords, and goes on to explain how to identify them in a piece of music. When writing four part harmony, particular attention should be paid to the use of thirds in chords. Thirds should normally be included but, while minor thirds can be doubled, the advice is to avoid the doubling of major thirds. We present a passage of four-part harmony that includes quite a number of chords which infringe the rule and show you how to identify the doubled major thirds and how to alter the layout of chords to correct the problem. Useful for all engaged in the writing of harmony. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1zWKzn1H02EagEMbV7enWqB2awxs4JXgg/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to identifying double major thirds\n1:52 - Why is doubling major thirds supposed to be bad?\n5:37 - How do you identify major thirds?\n7:31 - Spotting double major thirds in a piece\n17:06 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

After explanation about constructing a Diminished 7th, about key referencing it, and about inversions of the chord, the video explores the two notes that need particular resolution and the implications of that for voice leading and for the choice of resolution chord. More radical treatments of Diminished 7th chords are then investigated including the use of enharmonic change and the employment of chains of Diminished 7ths. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LpPRLi_DlG_xY2hwIgWH0vSshDHP6LAc/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how to resolve a diminished 7th chord\n0:28 - What is a diminished 7th chord?\n2:11 - Rules for resolving a diminished 7th chord\n3:31 - Inversions\n8:11 - Key referencing diminished 7ths\n14:01 - Breaking the rules\n15:44 - Enharmonic spellings to change keys\n17:25 - Chords that often follow a diminished 7th\n17:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music theory lesson looks at the different ways of calculating the notes needed in a pentatonic scale then considers the makeup of the major pentatonic and the minor pentatonic scale. Included in the video are ideas for composing and improvising using the pentatonic scale, making this video a great resource for performers and composers alike. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what is the pentatonic scale?\n0:14 - Heptatonic and pentatonic scales\n1:28 - A famous melody using a pentatonic scale\n2:28 - A little bit of history\n4:18 - The major pentatonic scale\n9:55 - Improvising with the pentatonic scale\n11:34 - The minor pentatonic scale\n13:16 - Relationships between major and minor scales\n16:32 - Thoughts for guitarists\n17:02 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson presents a short musical idea and demonstrates how to evolve it into an extended passage of three part counterpoint. The characteristics of the initial idea are considered from the perspectives of melodic and rhythmic design & harmonic implication. The video then demonstrates how to use the initial idea as a point of imitation throughout a passage scored for String Trio. Then the free parts are added showing how to vary the texture and to use ingredients of the main idea alongside chord tones and non chord tones. We end up with a complete passage of three part counterpoint. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14mcbLInpbXa2_ovDspMSBdheMCctcQqq/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to three-part counterpoint\n0:25 - The initial idea\n0:38 - Thinking about harmony\n5:39 - Analysing the design of the point\n6:48 - Key structure and harmonic plan\n19:51 - Working a piece of three-part counterpoint\n51:10 - Playing the piece\n51:57 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "This famous work was hardly played between the death of Pachelbel and a revival of the piece during the 1960\u2019s, since when it has been performed throughout the world in many contexts and new arrangements. This music appreciation lesson explores the repeated bass line (the ostinato) and repeated chord pattern that goes on throughout the piece following a pattern known as the Romanesca. The bass and chord pattern repeats 28 times while a series of 12 variations unfold above the bass in the three violin parts, which are presented in canon. Besides providing background and context to this famous Canon in D, the work is unpacked and analysed before covering a number of modern songs that embrace Pachelbel\u2019s Romanesca pattern. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/18TTvfwYN5s8lqiOBR-C8MBGgi0J2UP6L/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Pachelbel and his canon\n0:32 - Background of the piece\n2:32 - How the Basso Continuo worked\n6:00 - What is a musical canon?\n7:46 - What's a chaconne?\n8:19 - When and why was the canon written?\n15:31 - The ostinato bass line\n18:05 - Analysis of the chords\n20:34 - Romanesca pattern\n22:23 - Structure of the work\n25:57 - Variations of the melodic patterns\n29:56 - Modern music influenced by Pachelbel's canon\n31:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Colour in music can mean a number of different things. Some musicians experience Synesthesia in which particular notes, keys or chords are experienced directly in relation to particular colours. We talk about the Blues or about white noise, both terms that raise a reference to colour. The video expands on the above then goes on to explore colour in relation to chords, different textures, and to the varying colours available between one instrument or voice and another, and within the ranges of particular instruments or voices. The impact of dynamics, articulation, particular playing techniques, sound waves and instrument design all play their part in contributing to the colour and consequent emotional impact of a score. This music appreciation lesson explores the topic from the perspectives of the listener, the performer and the composer. \n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what is colour in music?\n3:11 - Instrumental colours\n10:34 - How does colour influence a composition\n11:52 - Varying the colour of sound\n15:59 - Why is colour in music important?\n16:34 - Describing tone colour\n17:32 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Refresh your knowledge of the diatonic chords and 7ths within any key and understand how chords can be presented in their various inversions. Specific examples are given at each stage and the descriptions of chords are explained in the Roman Numeral system, both combined with letters and with Figured Bass descriptions in the two internationally recognised systems, as well as being illustrated in lead sheet style.

      "description": "We trace the origins of Opera from the Camerata in Italy in the late 1500\u2019s through the early efforts of Peri and Caccini, through to Monteverdi and onwards to Caccini, to Lully in France, to Handel in England, and back to Pergolesi in Italy.

Some of the instruments are familiar to us but other instruments fell out of use, while other instruments were developed in new ways beyond the Baroque.

      "description": "See why every musician should become familiar with figured bass. For harpsichordists and organists needing to realise figured bass in performance realising figured bass fluently with style is essential. For others it\u2019s a useful way of understanding the mind of the Baroque composer. It\u2019s also a helpful way of thinking about music from the bass upwards rather than the more usual approach from the top downwards. Additionally figured bass helps to think about chords in terms of intervals above the bass line. Being able to think fluently between thinking chords in roman numerals, in lead sheet presentation, and in figured bass is the most helpful way of understanding harmony from multiple perspectives. So figured bass is for all. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1A1V5YihcnmDsxje9RY9VmyDTp0P7bcqI/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to why learn figured bass?\n3:35 - Explanation of how the figured bass system works\n9:31 - Seventh chords\n14:12 - Accidentals\n15:51 - Suspensions\n21:56 - Ways to play figured bass\n25:22 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

The video covers modulations and cadences, explores ways of working backwards as well as forwards, considers how to use common notes between one chord and the next, thinks out writing a bass line predominately in contrary motion with the given melody, suggests harmonic alternatives and how to evaluate the best choice in any given situation, considers how to achieve melodic integrity in each of the lines, adds colour and movement through devices such as secondary dominants and inessential notes, and explores how touches of counterpoint can be incorporated even in such a homophonic structure. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1LvTWo0ACTGnXPb6wBhqY9aoZ2BCLtHJh/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Bach's four-part writing\n1:20 - Musical phrases\n1:56 - Keys and modulations\n5:10 - Starting with the cadences\n8:06 - Playing the melody with the cadences\n8:32 - Filling out the cadences\n16:33 - Adding chords to first phrase\n25:21 - The first complete phrase\n26:41 - Adding chords to second phrase\n32:46 - Playing the completed chorale\n33:16 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson begins with a bass line and considers the best way to select chords to fit it. He then demonstrates how to write a melodic top line that fits with the harmony, that acts well alongside the bass line, and also works well as a melody. We consider the shape and direction of the melody along with the balance between conjunct and disjunct movement and the rhythmic character that can be achieved. Finally the middle parts are completed in a way that achieves as much stability as possible. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1YBZLk5npZVPvPNNtNR5AumB_fstzR3me/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to four-part harmony from a bass line\n1:31 - Explaining the exercise\n1:53 - Choosing the chords that work best\n11:23 - Designing a good melodic line\n17:34 - Filling in the alto and tenor lines\n23:17 - Getting a strong melodic line \n24:28 - Playing the finished piece\n24:38 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Many people struggle to know how to harmonize repeated notes. This music composition explores three strategies for dealing with such situations by harmonising the same note repeated six times. The first strategy is to consider the three diatonic chords that fit with the given note. The second strategy is to consider how to balance root position chords with inversion chords. The third strategy is to consider how to decorate the harmony with inessential notes and suspensions. A combination of these approaches ensures that repeated notes in the melodic line do not result in static harmony and a lack of progression. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Xu4tj35i6i78oOIAeP-8OkZ0NcW9vmnE/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how to harmonize repeated notes\n0:54 - An example of a melody with repeated notes\n1:54 - The simple solution\n3:44 - Thinking about a better solution\n5:54 - Choosing the chords and inversions\n8:46 - A more interesting cadence\n10:02 - Filling in the alto and tenor parts\n12:55 - Adding passing notes\n13:40 - Thinking dominant seventh chords\n15:06 - Switching notes between parts\n15:38 - Incorporating a suspension\n18:05 - Decorating the suspension\n19:06 - Hints of a chord III\n21:14 - How does it all work together?\n21:54 - Playing the final harmonization\n22:02 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

In particular, we discover how Bach uses a number of unresolved dominant 7ths back to back, making this a radical approach for Baroque times. Discover what Bach is doing and how successfully it works. We also take a look at the choice of harmony, the part writing, dealing with harmonic and melodic minor, plus other features of the Bach Chorale style.

A useful resource for performers and composers alike. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1932LtlnjJ8tRpPxLajgy9v6DDxJmtOJV/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to identifying non-chord tones\n0:34 - What's the point of non-chord tones?\n2:26 - Types of non-chord tones\n5:31 - Non-chord tones in context\n23:32 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music composition lesson takes a set of five notes and considers ideas for composing or improvising a piece based on those notes. We then explore how the Australian composer, Peter Sculthorpe uses this pitch set as the basis for a short piano piece. Having seen how the pitch set is used and repeated with different rhythms we examine other features of Sculthorpe\u2019s piece such as the use of pedal and low dynamics, as well as his permutations of the five note set.

Often composers write a successful melody but the accompaniment is limited to block chords. Using Alberti Bass is one way of liberating the accompaniment and even though this is a Classical period device it can be applied in music of other genres.

      "description": "We examine the opening section of Schubert\u2019s famous Impromptu in Gb in order to discover how Schubert creates emotion. Starting with the melodic line we discover how the contour works and how the phrase design enhances the rises and falls in musical tension. We then consider how the harmony supports the melody and how the figuration of the accompaniment plays a significant role. This composer insights lesson illustrates how these elements are combined through the genius of Schubert. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1AEr5DM5EuQVuGIrbWduKAkwuD48Z_End/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how Schubert creates emotion\n1:50 - Playing the piece\n2:40 - Melody\n8:16 - Harmony\n21:16 - Texture and design\n25:09 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Discover how Josquin des Prez developed compositional style during the High Renaissance period. Josquin des Prez followed composers like Du Fay and Ockeghem, and prepared the ground for Palestrina and his contemporaries. As a singer, much of his output is choral, including the secular Chanson. Most of his writing comprised sacred repertoire, such as Mass settings, and his most significant contribution came in the form of the Motet. His style is often homophonic but also frequently imitative. He was also one of the first composers to engage with word painting and with a less melismatic approach. This music appreciation lesson explores an overview of Josquin\u2019s music and the key features of his style, particularly through the window of the Motet. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BWNiJ8_NFe4EjW2Ml9gHLzuQ3-FN1l4k/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to Josquin Des Prez high Renaissance motets\n3:02 - His contribution to music\n7:43 -  What was Josqiuin about?\n11:09 - Domine ne in furore\n14:26 - Writing style and technique\n21:19 - Psalm text settings\n25:54 - An example of one of his motets\n26:48 - Analysing the music\n32:09 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

There is another more delicate, elegant side to Beethoven\u2019s musical personality that has roots in the Classical period. Step inside the mind of Beethoven as we explore the opening of his Op 49 G minor Sonata and unpacks the various aspects of this more delicate style. We examine the melodic design, the ingenious phrase structure and balance, the delicate textures, the using of figuration and ornamentation and the simple but beautifully crafted harmonic structure.

      "description": "A clever little music composition technique for you to try in your next piece. This music composition lesson begins with a reminder of how to extend triads to 7th chords in the conventional manner. It then goes on to consider an alternative way of introducing 7th chords by adding a note at the bottom of the chord rather than at the top. The result produces a way of starting with one chord, then using every note of the chord as common notes in forming the 7th of another chord. It\u2019s a great way of creating strong chord progressions and this video will be especially helpful to composers and arrangers. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1BZd8tUA32TcSvHvyo35pCnnztSeI7e38/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to upside down 7th chords\n0:21 - Building 7th chords\n2:48 - What are upside down chords?\n4:56 - Using chords upside down\n8:15 - Chord I example progression\n8:45 - Chord II example progression\n9:26 - Chord II example progression\n10:06 - Chord V example progression\n10:31 - Chord VI example progression\n10:55 - Chord VII example progression\n11:42 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Discover how to transform a piece of music that is using block chords into a much more engaging presentation with a moving bass line. Taking the opening of the British National Anthem this music composition lesson demonstrates how to keep the bass line moving by adding passing notes/ passing tones, auxiliary notes/ neighbour notes, by moving to other harmony notes/ chord tones. It then demonstrates how chromatic embellishment of the bass line can add colour to what otherwise might be a rather plain piece of music. This video will help musicians to understand more fully what is going on in much of the music they play and will empower composers wanting to transform something ordinary into something much more creative and engaging. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1HTw4UrP_tb5pOdcPjxAvM8DGVnsLj3bm/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to creating a moving bass line\n0:34 - Playing the piece\n1:15 - Techniques you can use\n3:11 - Working on the bass line\n16:29 - Playing the original version\n16:56 - Playing the adapted version\n17:21 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Many composers and students of harmony worry about harmonising repeated notes in a melody. Repeated notes can make for melodic stagnation and the remedy is often to create harmonic interest but how is this achieved? This music theory lesson goes through how to select the three diatonic chords that can be interchanged while a melody note is repeated, and explains how to use inversion chords in this context. He then explains how to use chromatic chords and secondary dominants to enrich the result further. In the example worked through during this video no fewer than eight repeated notes occur back to back in the melodic line yet the harmony is hugely varied. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1HhLdFxjfeCiAGG1hDD_oxJcMIRVu0WEk/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to how to vary the harmony for repeated notes\n0:36 - A straightforward way to solve the issue\n2:34 - The point of this video\n3:25 - Playing the example\n4:02 - Working through the example piece\n15:51 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "This music theory lesson summarises the rule of the octave and explains how it offers insight into harmonic thinking and into Baroque harmony in particular. The rule of the octave begins with the notion of harmonising an octave of the scale in the bass using first inversion chords. We learn how the pattern is modified progressively through starting and ending with the tonic chord in root position, then employing the dominant chord in root position, then by preceding each tonic and dominant chord with a 7th chord. This pattern is explored in major and minor keys. The rule of the octave explains many of the harmonic progressions that are still regarded as strong today. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1kzNOENWNin5bhyVpdsg2l_x9TjedpxYL/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to who needs the rule of the octave?\n0:50 - The root position chord problem\n2:30 - Harmonizing with first inversion chords\n4:13 - Mixing root position and first inversion chords\n5:54 - The creation of standard chord progressions\n6:49 - Further modification\n8:50 - Why a balance of harmony is important\n9:57 - Incorporating seventh chords\n11:58 - The creation of pre-dominant seventh chords\n13:44 - Applying this to minor keys\n17:07 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

We then explores how this works in the song \u2018September\u2019 by Earth Wind and Fire. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1sayYemAQ9j0Bs5cTXp8wZWd1TJ-WtGH4/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using 7th chords back to back\n0:31 - Forming seventh chords\n3:26 - Traditional conventions\n5:15 - Contemporary use back to back\n8:43 - Example of a song using this technique\n10:49 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music theory lesson explains why the choice of resolution chords are limited, essentially because the chord functions as a pre dominant.

We also examine how chord I in second inversion can be used between the flat II chord and the dominant chord.

In this case, the bass alternates falling thirds with rising seconds to generate a melodic pattern at the bottom of the texture, with an implied chord scheme that serves the sequence well.

Here we investigate this famous Arabesque written by Debussy during his early career and explore the hints of the Impressionism that are present in this work then goes on to explore aspects of structure, melodic design, harmonic framework, and texture that suggest ideas for interpretation in the use of balance, shape, rubato and other dimensions of a convincing performance.

      "description": "This music composition lesson follows on from an earlier video about the rule of the octave and you may well want to watch our other video first. In this lesson we examine the linear implications for part writing using the chord scheme presented by the rule of the octave, with one voice centred around the tonic, another centred around the third, and yet another centred around the fifth. The video covers the logic behind the choice of melodic notes then goes on to show how the parts are combined in the first, second and third positions. Ascending and descending patterns are covered, along with examples in both major and minor keys. This video offers insight into harmonic thinking that will illuminate Baroque style and the writing of harmony more broadly. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tNKI6mCaOnHmjYqOG6rHA734t5E5A6bi/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to what to do with the rule of the octave\n0:40 - Centre on the tonic\n6:18 - Centre on the third\n8:52 - Centre on the fifth\n10:30 - Putting parts together\n11:40 - Upper parts in first position\n11:51 - Upper parts in second position\n11:59 - Upper parts in third position\n12:06 - Importance of linear direction but with harmonic thinking\n13:04 - Descending\n13:45 - Centre on the tonic\n14:56 - Centre on the third\n16:08 - Centre on the fifth\n17:33 - Putting parts together\n17:51 - Upper parts in first position\n18:01 - Upper parts in second position\n18:10 - Upper parts in third position\n18:19 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Many people find it easier to harmonise an ascending scale than a descending scale and most people find it easier to harmonise a scale at the top of the texture than at the bottom. In this case, we examine a neat and sequential way of harmonising a descending scale in the bass by alternating root position and first inversion chords. This also neatly avoids generating any parallels. These kind of structures are useful for composers working in any genre. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tQx7usrPlYbUe_JtLo4SLLbbCvLSzjrm/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to alternating inversion chords when harmonizing a descending bass\n1:08 - Voice leading\n2:12 - Common mistakes\n2:59 - Solution\n6:22 - Alternative version\n6:59 - Making it more interesting\n10:37 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Descending scales in the bass can be awkward to harmonise satisfactorily without generating parallels. This pattern illustrates one way of handling the situation in a way that is musically interesting and which activates an engaging use of musical tension. These kind of structures are useful for composers working in any genre and are especially for building bridges or other connections between musical ideas. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1tpoqsQGc9Yn1Mrxa5cK6Kof6bRBgJiU3/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using suspensions to harmonize a descending bass\n1:13 - An example of bad harmony\n2:10 - A way around it using suspensions\n6:12 - Playing the piece\n6:22 - Tension and release effect\n6:57 - An alternative with suspensions in the middle part\n8:07 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

Sonata Form serves as the catalyst for honing your composition skills and nurturing your growth as a proficient music creator. This course begins with an explanation of Sonata Form - what it is and how it evolved during the Classical Period. We then analyse Sonata Form movements written by Mozart and Beethoven to discover how Classical Period composers wrote in this structure and in order to see how Sonata Form was to develop during the Romantic Period. The course also explains the possible variants within Sonata Form that composers might choose to explore. There follow two composition projects. In the first, we write the essentials of a Sonata Form movement in the Classical Period style, considering how to compose first and second subjects, how to develop and recapitulate material, when to include an introduction, a Coda and transition material.

Sonata Form serves as the catalyst for honing your composition skills and nurturing your growth as a proficient music creator. This course begins with an explanation of Sonata Form - what it is and how it evolved during the Classical Period. We then analyse Sonata Form movements written by Mozart and Beethoven to discover how Classical Period composers wrote in this structure and in order to see how Sonata Form was to develop during the Romantic Period. The course also explains the possible variants within Sonata Form that composers might choose to explore. There follow two composition projects. In the first, we write the essentials of a Sonata Form movement in the Classical Period style, considering how to compose first and second subjects, how to develop and recapitulate material, when to include an introduction, a Coda and transition material. In the second, we write a more extended Sonata Form movement in a more contemporary style, learning to deal with the challenges of working with Sonata Form in an atonal environment.\nhttps://www.mmcourses.co.uk/p/composing-in-sonata-form-course\n\n\ud83d\udc65 Social Media\nWebsite: http://www.mmcourses.co.uk\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MusicMattersGB\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MusicMattersGB\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/MusicMattersGB\nNewsletter: http://eepurl.com/dvgdUD\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Affiliate Links\nAmazon: https://geni.us/71PKSR\n\n#MusicComposition #LearnMusic #TheAllRoundMusician",

We then consider the implication of using too many non-chord tones when they start to clutter the melodic focus or harmonic activity. We consider the implications of tempo and other factors. An example of over use of non-chord tones is unpacked then a less congested alternative is examined.

Ascending scales in the bass can be awkward to harmonise satisfactorily without generating parallels. This alternating 5-6 pattern illustrates one way of handling the situation in a way that is musically interesting and which activates an engaging use of musical tension. These kind of structures are useful for composers working in any genre and are especially for building bridges or other connections between musical ideas. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1trEqxiAebzkTMynA2TQnnnZb1q-HA44E/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to harmonizing an ascending scale with 5-6 alterations\n1:41 - A simple solution\n7:14 - Playing the piece\n7:48 - Ideas to make it more interesting\n8:11 - Reversing the upper parts\n8:49 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Many people are comfortable working in the harmonic and melodic keys when harmonising a melodic line but feel less assured doing the same in the natural minor. In this music theory lesson we explore which chords are major, which are minor, and which are diminished. We consider how the chord lineup is different from the chord lineup in the harmonic and melodic minors. We go on to observe the harmonisation of a melody in the natural minor and consider how different the music feels when we contrast harmonisations in the natural minor with harmonisations using the harmonic minor. This video will free you up to harmonise with confidence in the natural minor. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10UggO3Q5phpqbyxwUgSaHAew_lEUZPFh/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using chords in the natural minor\n0:14 - Natural minor scales\n1:47 - Other minor scales\n3:28 - Chords in the natural minor scale\n4:39 - Comparing chords in natural to harmonic minor\n9:15 - Simple natural minor harmony\n11:24 - Playing the piece\n11:42 - Comparison with a harmonic minor version\n12:45 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

The various Schemas offered composers melodic and chord progressions that were useful patterns for opening or closing a piece of music or for modulating, for example. We explore examples of Schemas during this video that offer ongoing opportunities for tonal composers today. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/13oZHp-67KOs-n_cGzZ0UlN3UPAbbjnUC/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to using schemas to compose music\n0:17 - What are schemas?\n2:36 - An opening idea schema \n9:36 - A closing idea schema\n16:39 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

We start by constructing the scale and the chords in D natural minor, before going on to observe the harmonization of a melody in D natural minor. We consider the nature of each chord in D natural minor as major, minor and diminished. We then move on to consider a possible harmonisation of a melody in D natural minor, including the use of extended chords and suspensions / sus chords. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/14ZMTei58WgyoiEnWMjJmWDEcmVMAPXXp/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to harmonizing a melody using the natural minor\n0:20 - Natural minor scale formation\n2:34 - Chords of the natural minor scale\n7:12 - Playing the melody\n7:41 - Harmonizing the melody\n12:32 - Playing the completed harmonization\n12:48 - Natural vs harmonic harmonizations\n13:50 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Harmony text books often advise us to avoid using certain chord progressions. Why is that? This music theory lesson explains how the chord progressions under consideration can create difficulties in the part writing with consecutive / parallel fifths and octaves and also explains why the progressions are best avoided at cadence points. We consider the smooth progression of individual voices and how certain progressions create awkward leaps and we hear examples where alternative choices of chords generate more convincing outcomes. The video goes on to demonstrate how to use each of the progressions successfully and explores why style, mood and musical context make an impact on the choice to use these progressions or not. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16cDI7V3tKzjKVuLgLzKXlN5wKf1MKjPw/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to 4 chord progressions to avoid\n0:52 - building chords basics\n4:37 - First progression to avoid\n12:23 - Second progression to avoid\n18:00 - Third progression to avoid\n21:18 - Fourth progression to avoid\n24:36 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

This music theory lesson begins with a fundamental note and explains how to derive the overtones from that note that comprise the harmonic series. The video uses the principles of brass playing as a guide to how it all works and lists the first 16 notes of a harmonic series based on C as a fundamental note. We go on to learn how the valves and the slide work on brass instruments in order to capture every semitone / half step of the chromatic scale by combining different transpositions of the harmonic series. We also discover how these overtones enrich the sound of the fundamental note. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16xTkEVtlnby3j7SBR2ucNl2uG4xD4A55/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the harmonic series explained\n0:52 - Practical thinking\n4:12 - History of the harmonic series\n6:19 - Notes of the harmonic series\n8:16 - Resonant overtones\n9:11 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "We begin with a reminder of what is a pentatonic scale and how a pentatonic scale can be transposed. We go on to hear and look at a short melody written in C major pentatonic before comparing that with another melody written in A minor pentatonic. We see and hear how the tonic of the two melodies differs and how that enables us to define the melody as major pentatonic or minor pentatonic. This music theory lesson will be useful to those playing in major pentatonic and minor pentatonic and will also help those who are writing in major and minor pentatonic. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/16i9WWjjd1BWUDwmF2ogOrAsJSRMB2ciR/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to the difference between major and minor pentatonic scales\n0:16 - What is a pentatonic scale?\n1:15 - Major pentatonic scales\n2:27 - Minor pentatonic scales\n3:52 - The difference\n4:53 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "Harmony text books often advise us to avoid using this particular chord progression. Why is that? This music composition lesson explains how this chord progression can create difficulties in the part writing with consecutive / parallel fifths and octaves and also explains why the progression is best avoided at cadence points. The video goes on to demonstrate how to use the progression more successfully and explores why style, mood and musical context make an impact on the choice to use this progression or not.\n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/17J25ks9QIT3k7wU4CvYH_-NVYyVfeH0s/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to is VI-I a good chord progression\n0:47 - Building the basic chords\n3:35 - Why is chord VI-I a bad progression?\n8:01 - How to make it work\n12:23 - A note on cadences\n13:26 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!

      "description": "You may be someone who is used to using certain chords over and over again or you may be someone who is confident using diatonic chords but who is reluctant to explore more colourful harmony. This lesson explores the impact of 7th, 9th, 11th and 13th chords, covering possibilities for voicing those chords, how one extended chord might best progress to another, how you might impose a melody or a moving bass on an extended chord progression, and different things you could do with the texture. Conventional and less conventional progressions are investigated, along with chromatic alterations to extended notes within the chord. In short this series of videos will open your mind to new possibilities and encourage you to explore more. For many viewers this will be a real game changer. This video belongs to a set of 8 videos focused on using extended chords to create more colourful harmony. \n\n\u2b07\ufe0fDownload the files\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1KXHE0WT1mS0AjJs2rFXL6tB93siGT_F-/view?usp=sharing\n\n\ud83d\udd34 Subscribe for more videos just like this: http://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg?sub_confirmation=1\n\ud83c\udfb5 Become a Music Matters Maestro: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/join\n\ud83d\udc55 Merch store: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8yI8P7Zi3yYTsypera-IQg/store\n\n\ud83d\udd58 Timestamps\n0:00 - Introduction to cool extended chord progressions\n0:30 - What are extended chords?\n1:40 - The chord progression\n5:10 - Be careful\n6:37 - Using the progression to make music\n7:50 - Conclusion\n\n\ud83c\udf93 Learn Music Online with Music Matters\nLearn music theory, aural tests, composition, sight reading, orchestration and more!
