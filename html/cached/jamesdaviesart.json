I love the way the sunlight falls upon his head whilst the rest is in shade coupled with the dark background, it creates a mystery into what he's looking at.. maybe he's guarding his home watching something curious? maybe he's watching his owner walk towards his lead? Whatever it is, the pose and the photographers timing was perfect to create an awesome photo to work from. I look forward to my next chance to paint this handsome breed.",

To achieve this I used the soft pastels and added many layers. The problem being that hard pastels don't layer too easily over soft pastels, soft pastels will easily cover hard pastel though so I had to be careful which layers I was applying and when.\nI hope you enjoyed the video, thanks for watching!",

      "description": "Greyhound - Time Lapsed Pastel Portrait - Speed Painting\nIn this speed painting video, you will see the Greyhound portrait come to life. Starting from the blank Pastelmat page all the way to the signed and finished portrait at the end.. and in a fraction of the time!\n\nThis was a fairly straight forward portrait of a Greyhound with only a few minor changes made from the original image that I felt would help the overall look of the finished portrait. The changes were all in the background, if you look closely at the thumbnail for this time lapsed video, you can see that I've removed the water jug from the original image. I just felt that it would create an unnecessary distraction and by removing it, it would help tidy up the portrait allowing for all focus to be on the dog. The second thing was that I kept the detail work of the fencing to a minimum to again draw attention to the Greyhound.\nI paid close attention to something that you possibly hadn't even notice in the video, which is water droplets! Judging by the big tongue, I think that the Greyhound has been for its walk.. probably run.. and just had a refreshing drink as there is a large water droplet towards the end of its tongue and tiny sparkling droplets in the hairs on its muzzle. As I say, you probably didn't notice them (don't worry, I'm not upset!) but it's the small details in a portrait, like the water droplets, that help to tell the story of the happy greyhound, back from its walkies and enjoying a refreshing drink.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions relating to this video in the comments below, I'm happy to answer!

Starting with the blank pastelmat page all the way to the finished and signed portrait at the the end!!\n\nI didn't want to get carried away with adding too much detail to all the long grass around the dog as doing so is not only time consuming but completely unnecessary, it can actually take away from the overall appeal of the finished portrait. Instead of doing this, I kept the detail of the grass and bluebells loose to draw the viewers eye to the dog (the star of the portrait!) and by keeping all of the detail work on the dog, it creates a type of optical illusion in that the portrait appears to have a sense of depth and has been given an almost 3D type quality. The other thing that I was aware of, was that there were very few bluebells on the left side of the image that I was working from, so I simply added in some extra bluebells in the places where I felt that they would help to balance the out the portrait, making it easier on the eye for the viewer.\n\nYour welcome to ask any questions relating to this speed painting video in the comments, I'll be happy to answer!

Or, maybe you'd prefer to see if you can spot anything spooky that may have caused all the technical difficulties? If so, you're braver than I am.. I had to put all this together with my eyes closed.. as you will no doubt be able to tell!!\nI hope you enjoy it, thanks for watching!

      "description": "In this video, I'm trying out sculpting for the first time! How hard can it be??\n\nI decided to get a bit creative in this crafty crafts video and actually make something! I'm starting with a movie character or movie alien, I don't think he'd be classed as a monster because.. well, he didn't do anything! He just sits in the Cantina bar at Mos Eisley's space port.. he's not drinking.. I don't think he has a mouth? He could be wondering how he's going to eat his sandwiches? His name is MOMAW NADON aka Hammerhead, from the 1977 movie Star Wars. \nIf you follow my channel, you'll notice that I don't post any sculpting videos, that's because I've never sculpted before.. but I do post 'how to' videos and this is a bit of a 'How To' video.. or a 'How Not To' video.. you can decide!?\n\nLots of fun! Give it a go yourself, if you're interested!!\n\nWhat you'll need:\nWood, Wire, Foil, Polymer Clay (I used Sculpey), clay sculpting tools (although, I didn't really use mine much.. you could probably just use things from around the home), an oven, a little masking tape and finally acrylic paints. Oh, and you'll need some where that's easy to clean or put some paper down. That's sounds like a lot looking at the list but if you're interested in sculpting and want to create more things, then a lot of this will last you a while!",

Both are from the 2022 The Batman movie, so I'll be trying to spot differences between the two cars and the reasons for the differences in price.\n\nUnboxing both, first impressions and comparing. Then I'll see if its possible to improve on one of the Batmobile cars, by painting to add some simple weathering and damage effects! There's a few other things worth looking out for in this video.. but NO spoilers, so you'll have to see for yourself!\n\nIf you are looking for a cool Batmobile to add to your collection, or want some ideas or to see some ways to add effects with a little paint, then I hope you find this video useful!\n\nI hope you enjoy it, thanks for watching!!\n\nBATMOBILES:\nJada 253213008 THE Batman Batmobile with Figure 1:32\nJada 253215010 Batmobile Car Metal (Doesn't say scale! It's bigger though!!)\nPAINTS EFFECTS:\nDry Brushed on ARTEZA Matte finish acrylic paint.\n\nAll available from Amazon.\n\nIf you want details on the diorama, let me know in the comments.",

YAAWNNN... which is why I've kept it short and to the point.. much like a pencil! \nHopefully, it will be useful to anyone new to artwork interested in sketching and drawing and will give them a little extra help wit one of the most valuable tools in art!",
