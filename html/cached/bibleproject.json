      "description": "What is The Bible Project?\n\nThe Bible Project is a non-profit animation studio that produces short-form, fully animated videos to make the biblical story accessible to everyone, everywhere. We create videos, podcasts, and study guides that explore the Bible\u2019s unified story.\n\nThe Bible is a divine-human book that speaks God\u2019s word to his people. We believe it ultimately points us to Jesus, who has the power to change individuals and whole communities when we let the biblical story speak for itself.\n\nWe focus on the Bible's overarching themes and each book\u2019s literary design and are committed to understanding the Bible in its historical context.",

Join us as we explore John's visions and you'll learn the symbolic imagery and numbers of the book; including the seven seals, seven trumpets, seven bowls, the Lion of Judah, the 144,000, the two witnesses, and more.\n\n00:00 Summary of historical background, context and meaning\n02:09 Jesus' message to the seven churches\n03:44 John's vision of the throne of God\n05:29 The cycle of the seven seals\n08:22 The cycle of seven trumpets and the unsealed scroll\n\nJohn makes it clear that the Book of Revelation is both an \"apocalypse\" (revelation) and a \"prophecy.\" This type of Jewish literature recounted a prophet's symbolic visions that revealed God's heavenly perspective on history, so that the present could be viewed in light of history's final outcome. It was meant to comfort and/or challenge God's people. \n\nJohn says he was exiled on the island of Patmos, where he saw a vision of the risen Jesus standing among seven burning lights. The image, adapted from Zechariah 4, is a symbol of seven churches in Asia Minor. Jesus addressed the specific problems facing each church, and warned them that a \"tribulation\" was upon the churches that would force them to choose between compromise and faithfulness. In the midst of persecution, Jesus calls the churches to faithfulness.\n\n#BibleProject #biblebookoverviews #prophecy #revelation #endtimes #apocalypse #newtestament #revelations #secondcoming #eschatology #biblevideo #biblevideos #bookofrevelation",

(1:14) Why did God allow The Satan to live in the Garden of Eden, even if it was in rebellion against Him?\n\n2. (5:22) What are the seraphim? Why do you call seraphim \"snakes\" instead of \"burning ones?\"\n\n3. (13:06) Wasn't The Satan named Lucifer? Where did the name \"Lucifer\" come from?\n\n4. (19:22) Why do you say \"The Satan\" instead of just \"Satan?\" Why did translators leave out the \"The\" when translating the Bible?\n\n5. (24:42) When the world was created, God said it was \"good.\" Why did you say The Satan brings creation back into chaos and death in the video?\n\n6. (29:10) How can the sons of God have sexual relations with human women if they are spiritual beings? Do spiritual beings have reproductive organs?\n\n7. (40:01) What are the Nephilim and where did they come from?\n\n8. (42:47) How do humans participate in the evil we see in the world?\n\n9.

The entire class is available for free on the BibleProject app at http://classroom-beta.bibleproject.com/heaven-and-earth.\n\nWhat did the biblical authors intend to communicate when they used the word \"earth?\" Genesis 1 is an ancient cosmology that uses specific words and images to describe the ordered world as understood by ancient people. When we study this chapter, we can discover how the writers of the Bible understood the structure of the world and its origins \n\nIn Hebrew, the word for \"earth\" ('erets) typically means land rather than a globe or sphere floating in space. The raqia' is the solid dome above the land that holds back the waters above, and the creation of the raqia' creates a place where life can flourish. Dive into Genesis 1 and explore how these Hebrew words can help us see the important theological claim being made through this cosmology picture.",

The entire class is available for free on the BibleProject app at https://classroom-beta.bibleproject.com/introduction-to-the-hebrew-bible.\n\nHow can we read the Old Testament and understand the meaning its ancient authors intended? \n\nThese two simple ideas are at the core of the process.\n1. The Old Testament is an ancient text.\n2.  A text is intentional literary communication. \n\nWe interpret every text we read through the lens of our mental storehouse, or the \"encyclopedia\" of words, ideas, images, and stories stowed in our memories. But the biblical authors have their own encyclopedias from which they produce texts. So if we want to understand the authors' intended meaning, we will adapt our \u201cencyclopedia of reception\u201d by learning about the authors' \u201cencyclopedia of production.\u201d Dive into this class session with Dr. Tim Mackie and start developing tools for encountering the Old Testament on its own terms.",
