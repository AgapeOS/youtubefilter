Set aside. Melt the butter and sugar together in a medium saucepan. First, the mixture will be granulated, then go through a stage of separation before it finally comes together. Stir it constantly throughout this whole process.\n\nOnce the mixture comes together and starts to barely bubble, slowly stir in the milk. You\u2019ll see some chunks of sugar in the milk at first, which is fine. Continue to whisk and stir over medium heat until all the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens.\n\nPour a small amount of the thickened milk and sugar (about 1\u20444 cup) into the beaten eggs as you continue to whisk. Repeat this several times to gradually heat the eggs without scrambling them. Once you\u2019ve incorporated several cups of the hot milk into the eggs, pour everything back into the saucepan. Bring it to a boil and keep it there for one minute while you stir constantly.\n\nRemove from the heat, stir in the vanilla and strain through a sieve to catch any rogue bits of egg. Spoon into small bowls or ramekins and chill for at least two hours before serving. Top with whipped cream if desired.\ncreates small chunks. \n\n\ud83e\udde2 We have Old-Fashioned on Purpose Gear! https://homesteadswag.com\n\n\ud83d\udc13 LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:\n+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: http://homesteadcookbook.com\n+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: http://heritagecookingclass.com\n+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): http://learnhowtocan.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf0e OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:\n+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com\n+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: http://theprairiehomestead.com\n+ Follow Along on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead",

      "description": "Sourdough doesn't have to be complicated! Here's how I make my own sourdough starters using basic flour, water, and AIR!  \n**CLICK SHOW MORE FOR RECIPE**\n\nHow I Revived My Sourdough Starter After MONTHS of Neglect: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ei2hsKIpyRU\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f GET THE COOKBOOK: www.homesteadcookbook.com\n\nEASY Sourdough Starter Method: \n\n1\u20442 cup flour (whole wheat or unbleached all-purpose)\n1/4-1/3 cup uncholorinated water\nQuart jar\nSmall towel & rubber band\n\nTo begin: \nStart the process by adding 1\u20442 cup whole wheat flour and 1\u20444 cup water to the jar. Stir thoroughly and cover with a towel and rubber band. Let sit for 24 hours at room temperature. (Try to keep it in an area of your house that is somewhat warm. Very cool rooms tend to slow the action of a starter.)\n\nThe first feeding: After 24 hours, check the mixture for bubbles. If you see some, add 1\u20442 cup all-purpose flour and 1\u20444-1/3 cup water. If you don\u2019t see bubbles, give it a stir and let sit 24 more hours.\n\nThe second feeding: After 24 hours, check for bubbles again. If you still don\u2019t see any, dump out the mixture and start over. If you do see bubbles, discard half of the starter, add 1\u20442 cup all-purpose flour and 1\u20444-1/3 cup water and stir thoroughly. Let sit 24 hours.\n\nThe third feeding: Discard half of the starter, and feed with 1\u20442 cup all-purpose flour and 1\u20444 cup water, stirring thoroughly. Let sit 24 hours.\nContinue this routine until the starter is consistently bubbling and doubling in size within 8 hours of each feeding. At this point, you can store the starter in the refrigerator and feed it about once per week. When you plan to use the starter, pull it out of the refrigerator 24 hours in advance to feed it and allow it to warm up and grow.\n\n**Have chlorinated tap water? Simply set the water out in an uncovered container for\n24 hours before using it to feed your starter. This allows the chlorine to evaporate so it won\u2019t kill the wild yeast.\n\n\ud83e\udde2 We have Old-Fashioned on Purpose Gear! https://homesteadswag.com\n\n\ud83d\udc13 LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:\n+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: http://homesteadcookbook.com\n+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: http://heritagecookingclass.com\n+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): http://learnhowtocan.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf0e OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:\n+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com\n+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: http://theprairiehomestead.com\n+ Follow Along on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead",

Homemade pasta is a pantry staple you can make with THREE simple ingredients-- you're gonna love it! *CLICK SHOW MORE FOR RECIPE*\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f GET MY COOKBOOK: www.homesteadcookbook.com\n\nGet the full recipe & instructions: https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/02/homemade-pasta-recipe.html\n\nThe Easiest Bread You'll Ever Make: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsgUcpTLQww\n\nNO-FUSS HOMEMADE PASTA\n\n2 cups flour\n1/2 teaspoon sea salt\n3 large eggs\n\nCombine the flour and salt.\n\nMake a well in the center of the flour, and add the eggs.\n\nGently begin to mix the eggs, gradually drawing in flour with each stroke. Eventually a stiff dough will form.\n\nKnead the pasta dough for 6-7 minutes.\n\nIf the dough is too dry and won\u2019t stick together, add a 1/2 teaspoon of water. If it is too sticky, sprinkle in a bit more flour.\n\nKeep in mind this dough will be much stiffer than your traditional bread doughs. However, the longer you work it, the smoother and more pliable it will become.\n\nWe are looking for a smooth, satiny consistency, which will begin to develop the more you knead.\n\nCover the well-kneaded dough tightly with plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for around 45 minutes. (This resting phase is super important, as it gives the dough time to relax. Otherwise, you\u2019ll fight it the whole time you are rolling it out.)\n\nAfter the resting period, divide the dough into four portions. \n\nPasta Machine Instructions:\nRolling the dough is a process\u2013 you need to make several passes, throughout each thickness setting for the best results. I start with the biggest setting (usually 5 or 6), run it through once or twice there, and then start gradually adjust the settings to be thinner and thinner until I have the perfect sheet of golden pasta.\n\nBetween each pass, I like to fold the strip into thirds. This helps square up the edges and keeps things even. Then simply roll it through the cutting side of the machine to slice into spaghetti or fettucine.\n\nRolling Pin Instructions:\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a pasta machine, you can simply use a rolling pin and knife (or pizza cutter). Keep in mind you\u2019ll want to roll it out as thin as humanly possible, as it will plump up considerably once you cook it.\n\nRoll each portion of dough out on a well-flour surface and then cut into thin strips. Your noodles will be more rustic, but they\u2019ll still taste amazing.\n\nFrom here, you can either cook your pasta right away (3-4 minutes in boiling water) or dry it.\nIt also freezes well\u2013 just make sure you don\u2019t throw it into the freezer in a big lump, because then you\u2019ll end up with a pasta dumpling when you go to cook it.\n\nServe your perfect homemade pasta with homemade sauces, or olive oil, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.\n\n\ud83e\udde2 We have Old-Fashioned on Purpose Gear! https://homesteadswag.com\n\n\ud83d\udc13 LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:\n+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: http://homesteadcookbook.com\n+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: http://heritagecookingclass.com\n+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): http://learnhowtocan.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf0e OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:\n+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com\n+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: http://theprairiehomestead.com\n+ Follow Along on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead",

      "description": "Sourdough bread recipes are a dime a dozen and they all seem to contradict each other, which is SUPER confusing if you're a sourdough beginner! This is my tried-and-true BASIC sourdough loaf that keeps it simple, but will still WOW your family. *CLICK SHOW MORE FOR THE RECIPE*\n\nMake Your Own Sourdough Starter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOm6OOH2Hxw\n\nThe EASIEST Bread Recipe (uses regular yeast): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsgUcpTLQww\n\nProofing Baskets on Amazon: https://amzn.to/2yD6tvI\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0f GET MY COOKBOOK: www.homesteadcookbook.com\n\nBeginner Sourdough Bread Recipe\n(Get the PRINTABLE version of this recipe here: https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2020/04/sourdough-bread-recipe.html)\n\n\u00bd cup active sourdough starter (learn how to make sourdough starter)\n1 \u00bc cup lukewarm water\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n1 \u00bd teaspoons fine sea salt\n\nIn a large bowl, combine the starter and water.\n\nStir in the flour, and then add the salt.\n\nUse a fork to mix everything together until it becomes stiff-- then switch to your hands to bring the dough together in a rough ball (Remember: don't overmix! This is supposed to be a no-knead-style wet dough.)\n\nKeep the rough dough in the bowl, cover it, and let sit for 30 minutes.\n\nAfter this resting time is complete, stretch and fold the dough a few times to form it into a ball.\u00a0(See the video for a walk-through on how to do this.)\n\nCover the dough with a clean dish towel and let it rise in a warm place overnight or until doubled in size (or about 8 hours). I like to make the dough before bed and leave it in my turned-off oven (I leave the oven light on) to rise overnight.\n\nThe next morning (or after 8 hours), turn the dough out on your counter.\nFold it over a couple of times to tighten it into a ball, then let sit for 15 minutes.\n\nAfter this resting period is complete, gently shape the dough into a ball once more place into a well-floured proofing basket or a bowl lined with a well-floured dish towel. Remember: don't add too much flour and do not knead the dough!\n\nCover and rise for 2-3 hours, or until doubled.\n\nPreheat the oven to 450\u00b0F.\n\nSprinkle a thin layer of cornmeal in the bottom of a Dutch oven (optional, but this helps the bottom not to scorch)\n\nTip the loaf out of the proofing basket onto a sheet of parchment. Lower the parchment into the Dutch oven. Place the lid on the pot and bake for 20 minutes.\n\nRemove the lid and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until the loaf is deeply browned and crispy on top. (For a less crusty finish, bake for the entire time with the lid on.)\n\nMove to a cooling rack and allow the loaf to cool completely before slicing it.\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Old-Fashioned on Purpose T-Shirts & Hats! https://homesteadswag.com\n\n\ud83d\udc13 LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:\n+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: http://homesteadcookbook.com\n+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: http://heritagecookingclass.com\n+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): http://learnhowtocan.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf0e OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:\n+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com\n+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: http://theprairiehomestead.com\n+ Follow Along on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead",

Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter or the rim of a drinking glass, cut the dough into rounds.

Here's my little trick for the BEST homemade jam sweetened with honey. *CLICK SHOW MORE FOR RECIPE*\n\nGet My FREE Jam Makers Mini Course: http://theprairiehomestead.com/jam\n\nWant to start filling your pantry with more home-canned foods? I'll show you how with my Canning Made Easy system! http://learnhowtocan.com\n\nGet Pomona's Pectin (it also works with fruit juice or no sweetener at all!) at Lehman's: https://bit.ly/ppectin\nOr at Vitacost: https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8834312/type/dlg/https://www.vitacost.com/pomonas-universal-pectin?ta=pomona%27s+pectin&t=pomona%27s+pectin\nMy favorite honey: https://beewildrawhoney.com/shop/?ref=theprairiehomestead\n\n\ud83c\udf53 No-Sugar Jam Recipe \ud83c\udf53\n\n4 cups mashed fruit\n1/4 cup bottled lemon juice\n2 teaspoons calcium water*\n2 teaspoons Pomonas Pectin powder\n1 cup honey\n\n\r*This ingredient is unique to Pomona\u2019s pectin and is included in the box. Make the water by placing 1\u20442 teaspoon of the calcium powder into a jar with 1\u20442 cup water. Shake well. Will last in the refrigerator for many months.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Place the measured fruit into a large pot or saucepan with the lemon juice. Add the calcium water.\n2. Place honey into separate bowl and stir in the pectin powder.\n3. Bring the fruit to a full, rolling boil, then add the pectin/honey mixture. Stir well to dissolve the pectin completely. (This is also a good point to do a quick taste test to see if the jam is at a sweetness level you like).\n4. Return mixture to a full, rolling boil and boil for one minute.\n5. Check for gelling (see note below). If achieved, remove the pot\nfrom the heat.\n\n 6. Ladle the hot jam into waiting hot jars, leaving 1\u20444-inch of headspace. Affix lids and rings and process in a boiling water canner for 10 minutes plus 1 additional minute for every 1000 feet you are above sea level.\nNOTES:\n+ I added some fresh rhubarb to my jam in the video. Since it\u2019s crunchier than the mashed strawberries, I cooked it down for an additional bit of time before adding the pectin/honey mixture to give the rhubarb time to soften.\n+ A rolling boil means a boil that keeps bubbling away even when you are stirring it vigorously with a spoon.\n+ If your jam isn\u2019t gelling after the minute of boiling, it\u2019s OK to boil slightly longer. However, keep in mind that over boiling the jam will also result in lack of gel, so try to keep the cook time minimal.\n+ Resist the urge to double your jam batches. Increasing the quantity can affect how the pectin works and result in un-gelled batches. If you need to make a larger quantity of jam, simply make multiple batches in different pots.\n\n\ud83e\udde2 We have Old-Fashioned on Purpose Gear! https://homesteadswag.com\n\n\ud83d\udc13 LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:\n+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: http://homesteadcookbook.com\n+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: http://heritagecookingclass.com\n+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): http://learnhowtocan.com/\n\n\ud83c\udf0e OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:\n+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com\n+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: http://theprairiehomestead.com\n+ Follow Along on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead",

Wash the cabbage and remove any wilted outer leaves.\n\n2. Quarter the cabbage, remove the core, and slice the cabbage into thin strips. (I shoot for around 1/4\" wide.) Try to make the strips as uniform as possible, but don't feel like they have to be perfect. Oh, and side note, you might want to avoid the temptation to use a food processor for this step. I find it quickly winds up being cabbage puree.\n \n3. Place the strips in a large bowl, and sprinkle sea salt over the top.\n\n4. Allow the cabbage to sit for 15 minutes or so, and then start mashing. There isn't a right or wrong way to do this \u2014 just use your hands, a mallet, or whatever blunt object you can find to mash/knead/twist/press/crush the cabbage. The goal is to get the juices flowing.\n\n5. Mash/knead for about 8 minutes. Hopefully by the end of this process, you'll have a lovely pool of salty cabbage juice sitting in the bottom of your bowl. Taste the brine, and add more salt if necessary. The brine should taste quite salty, like sea water.\n\n6. Place a couple handfuls of cabbage into the jar, then thoroughly pack down with a wooden spoon. The goal is to eliminate as many air bubbles as possible.\n\n7. Repeat the packing and mashing until the jar is full \u2014 just make sure to leave about 2-inches of headspace at the top.\n\n8. If there is enough liquid flowing from your cabbage to cover it completely, congrats!\n\n9. If you need more liquid, dissolve 1 tablespoon fine sea salt in 4 cups water. Use this brine to top off the jar. This is important, because if you don't completely submerge the cabbage in liquid, it's susceptible to mold and other gunk.\n\n10. Cover the exposed cabbage with brine, leaving 1-inch of headspace at the top. If you\u2019re having troubles with the cabbage floating to the top, you can weigh it down with a glass weight, or even wedge a piece of the cabbage core on top to hold it down. Any cabbage that is exposed will need to be thrown away, but you were going to toss the core anyway, so it's no big loss.\n \n11. Affix a lid or airlock to the jar (fingertip tight), and set aside in a room-temperature location, out of direct sunlight, for at least one week.\n\n12. Place a small plate under the jar, as they have the tendency to leak a bit and spill over.\n\n13. After a few days it\u2019s a good idea to \u201cburp\u201d the jar once a day, to release pent-up gas.\n\n14. Taste and smell your kraut after one week. If it's tangy enough for your tastes, move to the refrigerator for storage. If you like a bit more tang, allow to ferment for a bit longer.",

Cover the bowl and let rise on the counter for 3 to 6 hours, until at least doubled in size. Because of the lengthier rising period, I don\u2019t worry about putting this dough in a warm place like I do with other yeast breads.\n\nIf you like, you can fold the dough ever few hours, but this is not required. To fold, grab one side of the dough. Pull up, fold over and repeat until you've folded each \"side\" of the dough ball once. \n\nTO BAKE THE SAME DAY:\n\nAt least 45 minutes before you plan to bake, place a 5-quart Dutch oven with the lid on into the oven and preheat the oven to 475\u00b0F.\n\nDivide the dough in half and gently shape each piece into a ball. (Avoid punching or kneading it\u2014we want to keep as many air pockets in the dough as possible.) Slash the top of the dough balls several times with a serrated knife. Set the dough balls on separate pieces of parchment and let sit at room temperature for 45 minutes while the oven heats.\n\nWhen you are ready to bake, very carefully remove the Dutch oven lid and lower the parchment and one loaf inside. Replace the lid and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the lid and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes. You are looking for the crust on this bread to be deeply browned.\n\nRemove the finished loaf from the Dutch oven and cool on a wire rack. Sliced after it has cooled.\n\nTO BAKE LATER:\n\nAfter the initial rise time, put the dough in the refrigerator (covered) for up to 3 days. The flavor will improve the longer it sits. When you are ready to bake, remove the dough from the fridge, shape as directed above, and let sit at room temperature for 2 hours. Preheat the Dutch oven in 475* oven for 45 minutes. Bake as explained above.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\ud83d\udc69\u200d\ud83c\udf3e Design YOUR Dream Homestead, No Matter Where You Live: http://theprairiehomestead.com/layout\n\n\u2714\ufe0f Old-Fashioned on Purpose T-Shirts: http://homesteadswag.com\n\n\u2714\ufe0fAll my favorite homesteading supplies & ingredients: https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/shop\n\n\ud83d\udc13 LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:\n+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: http://homesteadcookbook.com\n+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: http://heritagecookingclass.com\n+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): http://learnhowtocan.com/\n+ Prairie Homestead Merch! http://homesteadswag.com\n+ The Homestead Mercantile: http://theprairiehomestead.com/shop\n\n\ud83c\udf0e OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:\n+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com\n+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: http://theprairiehomestead.com\n+ Follow Along on Instagram: http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead",

You can find it in my upcoming book, Old-Fashioned on Purpose. \n\n \u27a1\ufe0fPreorder NOW at www.oldfashionedbook.com",

We live in a super harsh climate so I plant one batch in my greenhouse now and one batch outside early June.\n\n- Organic potatoes are safest since conventional ones are sometimes sprayed with anti-sprouting chemicals \n\n- The sprouts on my potatoes in the video are HUGE and that\u2019s not ideal. I break the big sprouts off and choose larger potatoes that still have enough energy to grow. \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f If you\u2019d like more hacks to help you save money and build a more stable homestead, check our my Recession-Proof Homestead training: www.recessionproofhomestead.com",

(I said that in a confusing way in the video) \n\nThe combination of cover crops + mulching has been pure magic for my soil.\n\nThe key is letting the covers get tall enough that cutting them kills the crop. I like to wait a week before I plant my seedlings in the root stubble.\n\nThe root mass will continue to decompose throughout the growing season, leaving you with lovely soil texture. I\u2019ve done this with clover & winter rye with fantastic results.\n\nI get all my seeds from True Leaf Market: \n\nhttp://theprairiehomestead.com/seeds\n\n**Use my code PHOMESTEAD10 to save $10 on your order of $50 or more.**\n\nI recommend starting with their all purpose \"Garden Cover Crop Mix\" if you're unsure of what type you need. \n\nOtherwise, I love rye for breaking up hard/clay soils and clover for adding nitrogen.\n\nThis blog post has more detailed info on how to plant and terminate the crops:\nhttps://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2019/10/garden-cover-crops.html",
