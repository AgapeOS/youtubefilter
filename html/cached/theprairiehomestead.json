You can find it in my upcoming book, Old-Fashioned on Purpose. \n\n \u27a1\ufe0fPreorder NOW at www.oldfashionedbook.com",

We live in a super harsh climate so I plant one batch in my greenhouse now and one batch outside early June.\n\n- Organic potatoes are safest since conventional ones are sometimes sprayed with anti-sprouting chemicals \n\n- The sprouts on my potatoes in the video are HUGE and that\u2019s not ideal. I break the big sprouts off and choose larger potatoes that still have enough energy to grow. \n\n\u27a1\ufe0f If you\u2019d like more hacks to help you save money and build a more stable homestead, check our my Recession-Proof Homestead training: www.recessionproofhomestead.com",

(I said that in a confusing way in the video) \n\nThe combination of cover crops + mulching has been pure magic for my soil.\n\nThe key is letting the covers get tall enough that cutting them kills the crop. I like to wait a week before I plant my seedlings in the root stubble.\n\nThe root mass will continue to decompose throughout the growing season, leaving you with lovely soil texture. I\u2019ve done this with clover & winter rye with fantastic results.\n\nI get all my seeds from True Leaf Market: \n\nhttp://theprairiehomestead.com/seeds\n\n**Use my code PHOMESTEAD10 to save $10 on your order of $50 or more.**\n\nI recommend starting with their all purpose \"Garden Cover Crop Mix\" if you're unsure of what type you need. \n\nOtherwise, I love rye for breaking up hard/clay soils and clover for adding nitrogen.\n\nThis blog post has more detailed info on how to plant and terminate the crops:\nhttps://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2019/10/garden-cover-crops.html",
