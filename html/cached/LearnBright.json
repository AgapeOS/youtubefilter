      "description": "The animal kingdom is full of creatures of all varieties, including the odd ones. Weird Animals for Kids discusses three strange animals that you may or may not know about. The first is the axolotl. This cute salamander is one of the strangest amphibians in the world. It remains aquatic as an adult because of a condition called neoteny. Axolotls are carnivores and used to be at the top of the food chain in their environment. The introduction of invasive species, however, has changed that dynamic, so they have become endangered in the wild.\n\nUp next is the aye-aye, a rainforest mammal from Madagascar. It's the world largest nocturnal primate, spending 80% of the night foraging for food. Aye-ayes have an long middle finger that they use to find food and extract insects or dig the pulp out of fruit. They help the environment, too, because they eat wood-boring beetle larvae that could otherwise overtake the woods.\n\nFinally, the blobfish. Out of water, these fish look incredibly odd, but they look much more normal in the ocean. They will eat pretty much anything that's edible. And they have no predators because they live so deep that the water pressure is too intense for most predators. Like the axolotl, blobfish are endangered for a couple reasons. While they lay thousands of eggs, only a few survive to adulthood. Overfishing and deep-sea trawling have also caused a huge decline in their populations.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these very unique animals!

      "description": "Did you know that jellyfish have no bones, no brain, and no heart? In Jellyfish for Kids, you and your students will learn a lot about these interesting underwater creatures. Apart from the lack of brain and heart, jellyfish have unique physical characteristics that set them apart from other animals. They are made up of a soft, gelatinous material and have a nearly transparent body. And you will certainly recognize those long, flowing tentacles.\n\nThe diet of a jellyfish typically includes small animals like tiny fish, shrimp, zooplankton, even baby jellyfish. But jellyfish have a unique way of getting their food. When a jellyfish is hungry, it stretches its tentacles out in the water. When a small animal like a plankton or a tiny fish touches these tentacles, the stinging cells shoot out tiny harpoons filled with venom. The venom paralyzes or stuns the prey, making it easier for the jellyfish to catch and eat. The tentacles pull the prey into the jellyfish's mouth, which is in the middle of its body.\n\nJellyfish may seem like simple creatures, but they play an essential role in the ocean's ecosystem. One of the things they do is help keep the balance of other animals in check. They eat small fish and tiny creatures called zooplankton. If there were too many small fish and zooplankton in the ocean, they could overeat the plants that grow in the water, which would upset the balance of the entire ocean. Jellyfish help make sure everything stays in harmony.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting sea creatures!

      "description": "Did you know that parrots are excellent parents? Did you know they can hold stuff with their feet? In Parrots for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about parrots. It's a pretty well-known fact that these birds are very beautiful with their vibrant feathers of all colors! They're social birds too, so they like to live in flocks.\n\nYou might wonder why parrots can mimic sounds they hear. This is actually because of an extraordinary part in their brain called the song system. It allows them to learn and replicate sounds they hear in their environment. The skill is a way for parrots to communicate with each other and even bond within their flocks. They can use different sounds to express their emotions and intentions.\n\nSome species, like the Spix's macaw (or blue macaw), are very rare and critically endangered. This is due to several factors, such as habitat loss or the illegal pet trade. Not all species are in trouble, but for those that are, we need to do what we can to provide extra protection for their survival.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful birds!

      "description": "Did you know chimpanzees are similar to humans when it comes to caring for their young ones? It's true! In this video for kids, you'll learn that chimpanzees are excellent parents! Baby chimpanzees stay close to their moms and hold on to their fur when they need a ride. Moms make cozy nests for them to sleep in at night. Like human babies and children, chimps learn essential things from their parents, like how to find food and be safe in the jungle.\n\nDespite what people used to think, chimps are omnivores and eat both meat and plant foods. Because of their keen senses, they are excellent foragers and can easily locate delicious treats in the forest. Their eyesight is excellent for spotting fruits and other food high in the trees. They also have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out ripe fruits or fresh plants to eat. And when they're in the mood for some protein, like insects or small animals, their quick thinking and use of tools come in handy.\n\nThese amazing primates are also known for their impressive tool-making skills. Chimps can create tools from objects they find in the environment to help them get food or solve problems. For instance, they might use leaves as sponges to soak up water and drink from them. This kind of tool use sets them apart from many other animals and shows their ability to innovate.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these precious primates!

      "description": "Did you know that the largest squid have the biggest eyes of any animal in the animal kingdom? It's true! Their eyes can be as large as basketballs. In Squid for Kids, you'll learn a lot more about these rocket-like creatures of the sea, including the fact that, like other ocean animals, they can glow in the dark because of their ability of bioluminescence.\n\nSquid are like the race cars of the ocean because they have a unique way of swimming: jet propulsion. They have a body part called a siphon that helps them shoot water out with great force. By doing this, they can zoom through the water at impressive speeds. Think of it like a squid's rocket engine! This ability helps them catch prey and escape from predators in the blink of an eye. As an added superpower bonus, they can shoot a dark cloud of ink in their predators' faces and jet away.\n\nNaturally, squid are part of the ocean's food chain. They are a favorite meal for many larger animals, including whales and seabirds. When squid populations are healthy, there's plenty of food for these other creatures, which helps keep the whole underwater world in balance. Additionally, when squid eat tiny marine life like plankton, they help control those populations, preventing overgrowth that could harm the ocean.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these fun sea creatures!

As an added superpower bonus, they can shoot a dark cloud of ink in their predators' faces and jet away.\n\nFor the full video, click here: https://youtu.be/t95q8vxkoeg\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these fun sea creatures!

      "description": "Did you know adult hippos can hold their breath for five minutes under water? Or that they produce their own sunscreen to shield them from the hot sun? In Hippos for Kids, you will learn lots more fun facts about these large mammals. For instance, they are fast! They may look big and bulky, but these animals can run surprisingly fast.\n\nHippos like to live in groups called pods. These pods can have anywhere from a few hippos to over 100! Living in a group helps them stay safe from predators like lions and crocodiles. They can hold their breath for a long time, so they spend a lot of time in the water. Hippos are also known for being noisy animals. They make loud grunts and roars to communicate with each other.\n\nHippopotamuses might seem like big, water-loving animals that splash around and don't do much else, but they're essential for our environment. They are known as ecosystem engineers. This is because they create unique habitats in the rivers and lakes where they live. It might sound a bit yucky, but when hippos poop in the water, the nutrients in the poop help plants grow. These plants provide food and shelter for many other animals, like fish and birds. Hippopotamuses truly help make their homes a better place for all living creatures in the habitat.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these hungry herbivores!

      "description": "What do you know about these hooded reptiles? In this video for kids, you'll learn why cobras have hoods and a lot more. Cobras are truly remarkable snakes with distinct physical features. They have long, slender bodies covered in smooth scales in various colors, including green, brown, and black. Their hoods, which they can puff up to appear larger and scarier when they feel threatened, set them apart from other snakes. These hoods are like their own special shields, and they use them to warn potential predators to stay away.\n\nCobras are carnivorous, and their favorite snacks include small animals like birds, rodents (such as mice and rats), and even other snakes! Cobras have long, sharp teeth called fangs that are hollow like tiny straws. When a cobra bites its prey, the venom flows from the fangs into the prey's body. This venom contains proteins and chemicals that can quickly paralyze or even kill the prey, making it easier for the cobra to have its meal.\n\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the hoods! Cobras have a fascinating ability to create unique \"music\" with their hoods, which is a form of communication. Their hoods are like musical instruments, and cobras can make rhythmic movements with them to send signals. When a cobra feels threatened or wants to warn other animals to stay away, it can open its hood. The display shows off the cobra's size and can make it look more intimidating.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these slick snakes!

      "description": "Do you know why killer bees are called killer bees? This video will enlighten your kids about the diet, behaviors, and habitat of the Africanized honey bee. That's right! Killer bees are also known as Africanized honey bees. This is because the ancestors from which they get their aggression are from Africa. (African honey bees are an especially hostile species.)\n\nAfricanized honey bees, though, actually have a mix of both African and European bee genes. They are known for their adaptability to hot climates and their ability to thrive in different environments. Those traits make them attractive to scientists who want to study how animals adapt to new homes.\n\nScientists gave these insects the nickname \"killer\" bees because of their aggressive behavior when it comes to defending their nests. And because killer bees have killed some humans! They are famous for being fast fliers and quick to protect their nests. When threatened, they form a swarm and chase away the intruders. Scientists call this behavior aggressive defense. It's like having a neighborhood watch that's always on high alert! When they swarm, their buzzing can be quite loud, which is their way of warning others to stay away.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting insects!

      "description": "Did you know lemurs are really social? It's true! In this video for kids, you'll learn that lemurs live in troops. They help each other find food and watch for predators such as hawks and snakes. Some lemurs enjoy grooming each other, meaning they help clean each other's fur. Grooming helps them build strong bonds within their groups and stay healthy.\n\nThese primates are what scientists call opportunistic feeders. This means they eat whatever food they can find without too much hunting. Lemurs have sharp teeth for chewing plants and nibbling on insects or small animals. They are also great at using their keen sense of smell to find the  treats in the forest, such as ripe fruits and fresh leaves. So, while they're not the fastest hunters, they're skilled at finding delicious meals.\n\nApart from a zoo, you won't find lemurs anywhere in the world except for the island country of Madagascar in Africa. This makes these unique animals endemic. Scientists categorize animals as endemic when they are found in only one specific area. Lemurs are a treasure unique to Madagascar, so it's vital to protect their home and ensure they continue to thrive there.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these amazing animals!

      "description": "What is a memorial? In ASL Lincoln Memorial for Kids, your students will learn the history surrounding this famous structure. Memorials or monuments (like statues) represent something unique to everyone who sees them. Monuments have meaning and significance to the people who visit them. Although there are thousands of monuments across the United States, many of the most famous monuments are in our nation\u2019s capital\u2014Washington, DC.\n\nOne of the most famous monuments in the US is the Lincoln Memorial. Abraham Lincoln is a true American success story. He was the son of a poor farmer who lived on the frontier. He read books that he borrowed after long days working on the farm. But eventually, in 1837, Lincoln worked hard enough to earn a law degree. In 1846, he was elected to the House of Representatives. His calm demeanor and willingness to compromise helped heal the war-torn nation and reunite the North and South into one country. Unfortunately, Lincoln was assassinated in April of 1865, in the middle of his second presidential term. \n\nCongress began work to create a memorial to remember his patriotism two years after his death. In March of 1867, Congress created a commission to design and build the memorial. It would be another 43 years\u20141910\u2014before Congress would pass a bill that allowed work to begin on the Lincoln Memorial! It took another 12 years to complete the project from the day of the design and construction. In 1922, President Harding and Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Robert Taft officially accepted the memorial on behalf of the American people.\n\nIronically, although many African Americans were invited and attended the event, they were moved to a segregated area near the monument. The very people Lincoln had fought so strongly to free still faced racial discrimination nearly 60 years after the Civil War ended in 1865.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this famous monument!

      "description": "Did you know that hawks are the most common birds of prey? In this video, you and your kids will learn lots of interesting facts about the hawk. For instance, even though they are similar to eagles and buzzards, only 50 kinds of true hawks exist. These beautiful birds build large nest in the tops of trees, on cliff peaks, and even on cactuses. Most species have long tails and short rounded wings so they can fly fast and low through areas full of trees and bushes.\n\nHawks are quite intelligent birds, too. They use sticks and stones as tools to catch insects to eat if they cannot find any other prey. Because hawks are birds of prey, they hunt and kill animals for food. And they truly are fierce hunters. They can see their prey from high up in the sky because of their incredible eyesight. In fact, they have the best eyesight of any animal in the animal kingdom! Once they spot their food, they will dive down and scoop up the animal.\n\nImagine flying through the air at 150 miles per hour. That's how fast hawks are! When it's mating season, the male hawks will do lots of tricks in the air to attract a mate. Once they find their mate, hawks stay together forever. Baby hawks are called ayes (pronounced just like eyes). When they are about 50 days old, they leave the nest to fend for themselves.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful birds!

      "description": "Do you know how to calculate sales tax? In part six of our Financial Literacy for Kids series, you will learn how to do just that! Sales tax is an extra cost that is added to a product or service that you buy. The government uses sales tax money to pay for things, such as new roads and water lines.\n\nSome states don't use a sales tax. Those states are Delaware, Alaska, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon. That means that if you want to buy something for $100, you only pay exactly $100, and no more. There are also states that don't charge sales tax on certain kinds of purchases, such as groceries and food or prescription medications.\n\nSales tax is calculated as a percentage of the purchase price of an item. Generally, the percentage is somewhere between 4% and 9%. Keep watching to follow along with the example to figure out how to calculate sales tax. You will also learn a cool trick for calculating sales tax easily! \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important skills!

      "description": "Part of becoming financially literate is understanding how to calculate interest. In this video, your kids or students will learn what exactly interest is and how they can calculate it. Interest is an amount of money that you either pay or earn. Whether you pay or earn depends on the situation. If you borrow money, you have to pay interest. If you save money at a bank, you will earn interest.\n\nThere are a few terms you should be familiar with. The principal is the amount of money you start with that you are borrowing or spending. Another term to know is rate. The rate is the percentage you are charged (if borrowing money from a bank/company) or paid (if saving money in a bank). You will be able to use the rate and principal to determine the interest using an equation: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time (years).\n\nThe video goes through a helpful example scenario to walk you through calculating interest when saving money at a bank. In this case, Frankie Finance is starting with $200. The rate will be 0.15. Based on the equation, Frankie will earn $30 dollars per year in interest. Next, you can follow another scenario in which Frankie borrows money and owes $30 extra a year! The equation is the same regardless of whether or not you're borrowing or saving.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important skills!

      "description": "Have you ever heard of condor? In this video for kids, we will discuss interesting facts and characteristics of this large predator. Follow along with the high-interest reading lesson plan on our website! Condors are large black birds with triangular patches of white on the underside of its wings. They have the largest wingspan of any North American birds. In fact, sometimes they are mistaken for small, distant airplanes. \n\nUsually, the males are smaller than females when it comes to birds of prey. But with condors, it's the opposite. The females a little smaller, but not by too much. These birds weigh about 20 pounds! The head and neck of a condor are bald, which is an adaptation for hygiene. When they're high in the sky, the UV rays of the sun disinfects their skin. This makes them resistant to disease and infection! Depending on the bird's mood, its skin color ranges in color. Plus, the changing skin color is a way for them to communicate with other condors.\n\nWild condors can travel up to 150 miles a day for food. They eat carrion, which is the decaying carcass of a dead animal. They prefer large animals like horses, cows, and mountain lions. But they aren't too picky. They will feast on smaller animals if they need to. Given that their meal is dead, you would think it would smell really bad. But condors have no sense of smell!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting birds!

      "description": "Do you know how to figure out the absolute value of a number? In this video, you'll learn just that. It can be a tricky concept at first, but once you get it, it's super easy! Absolute value is basically determined by its distance from zero on a number line. And every single number has one except for zero, since zero is value-less.\n\nAbsolute values are written in two straight lines. For comparison, other expressions are in brackets or parentheses. But those two straight lines means absolute value. In addition, the placement of the negative sign is very important. If the negative symbol is inside the absolutely value lines, the you are figuring out the absolute value of a negative number. For instance, the absolute value of -5 is 5 because -5 is five away from zero.\n\nOn the other hand, if the negative sign is outside the absolute value lines, then you need to add it after you figure out the absolute value expression. For instance, \u2013|6| is \u20136. Here's a trickier one: The expression \u2013 |7 \u2013 9| becomes \u2013 |\u20132|, which becomes \u2013|2|, which is \u20132. Watch the video for more examples, and to learn how you can apply absolute value in real life.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about absolute value!

      "description": "Did you know dragons really do exist!? Well, maybe not the flying, fire-breathing kind. In Komodo Dragons for Kids, you'll learn all about these interesting reptiles and why they are considered an apex predator. These dragons live only in Southeastern Indonesia on a collection of islands. They use strong, sharp claws and teeth to catch their food. They also possess a unique gland in their lower jaw that secretes venom that immobilizes their prey. Their long, forked tongue helps them gather chemical information from the air, allowing them to locate potential food sources.\n\nKomodo dragons are really good at sneaking up on their prey. They have a particular skill called ambush predation. It's like a surprise attack! They hide in tall grass or behind rocks, and when an animal comes by, they use their strong legs and sharp claws to pounce on it. Crazy enough, Komodo dragons have a secret weapon\u2014their saliva! Their spit is full of harmful bacteria that can make an animal sick. So, even if the prey they are after gets away, it might not survive for long.\n\nAs for whether Komodo dragons are endangered, the answer is a bit complicated. They are not endangered overall, but their situation is tricky. You see, people sometimes hunt the dragons, and their homes are getting smaller because of things like deforestation. This makes it harder for them to find food and safe places to live. So, even though they are not endangered everywhere, some groups of Komodo dragons are at risk. We need to protect their habitats and make sure they have enough food to keep being the fantastic nature helpers they are!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these regal reptiles!

      "description": "Did you know that bats are the only mammals that fly? It's true! Many people mistake bats for birds for this very reason. Believe it or not, bats are more closely related to humans than they are to birds. They don't have feathers; instead, they have fur in various colors. They have fingers and thumbs just as we do!\n\nThere are over a thousand bat species. Some of them are very small, but some are so large that their wing spans are 5 feet wide! Their wings are pretty unique. They are made of a thin skin-like material that connects all their fingers and thumb to their feet. And despite what people think, bats have excellent eyesight and hearing.\n\nSome bats eat other animals, like small birds, reptiles, mice, or even other bats. But most bats just stick to an insect diet. In fact, small bats about the size of an adult thumb can eat 4-8 grams of insects every night. That may not seem like much, but even if only a million bats ate that many insects, it equates to a thousand metric tons every single night!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this exciting unique mammal!

      "description": "Did you know that there are over 20,000 species of butterfly living throughout the world? In Butterflies for Kids, you and your students will learn lots of interesting facts about these lovely bugs. Speaking of lovely, butterflies actually have two types of coloration: pigmented and structural. And some species have ultraviolet patterns that we humans can't even see!\n\nButterflies eat lots of things some of which you likely wouldn't expect. They have a long tongue called a proboscis that they use to slurp up juices and nectar and tree sap. But butterflies also eat aphids, drink from mud puddles, and consume rotting or dead matter! And believe it or not, they've only got a few taste buds on their \"tongue\" because most of their taste buds are on their feet.\n\nButterflies are essential to the environment. Along with other pollinators, they help pollinate plants and increase biodiversity. Scientists can also study them to learn about the health of a particular ecosystem. Because of habitat loss, the populations of various butterfly species are on the decline. In addition, climate change has also caused butterflies to struggle. Unpredictable temps lead to unpredictable hatching times, which can be disastrous for caterpillars.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful insects!

      "description": "When did people first start to inhabit North America? Try 27,000 years ago! In Earliest Peoples in America, your kids will learn about some of the history surrounding the people who first stepped foot on this continent. The first thing they'll learn is that the earth was much, much colder then because it was in the middle of an ice age.\n\nAsia and North America used to be connected by the Beringia land bridge. But once the ice melted as the earth warmed up 10,000 years ago, the people could no longer migrate. The earliest humans were hunter-gatherers. This means they hunted for food and ate wild plants they found. The people eventually became much less nomadic and started to settle in specific areas in tribes.\n\nThe people passed on their traditions and culture from generation to generation. Sadly, once the Europeans started to colonize America, a lot of that culture was lost. Archaeologists have studied the artifacts left behind from thousands of years ago to learn more and more about these early peoples and what their lives might have been like.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about what life might have been like for people 27,000 years ago!

      "description": "What is the difference between a checking and savings account? In Financial Literacy\u2014Checking and Savings Accounts, your students will learn the basics behind these two accounts and how to manage them. For instance, they will learn that they can transfer money from one to the other and vice versa.\n\nChecking accounts allow us to use debit cards. This means that we can pay with our debit cards, and the money will come out of the checking account. This way, we don't have to go get the money from the bank every time we need to use it. Savings accounts, on the other hand, do not have cards to use. They do, however, gain interest. Interest in additional money that grows over time according to how much money is in the account.\n\nSpeaking of money in the account, that number is the balance. Whenever we spend money from our checking account, the balance goes down. When we add money, the balance increases. The same is true for savings accounts as well. When we add money, the balance goes up, and taking money out of savings brings the balance down.\n\nThe great thing about these bank accounts is that they can be linked. If you need to put more money into your checking account, you can move it from your savings to your checking. This is helpful if you need to buy something but don't have quite enough to pay for it in your checking account. And of course, you can move money from checking to savings too. The more money in your savings account, the higher the interest!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important skills!

      "description": "So what's with those small, plastic cards that adults use to buy stuff? In Financial Literacy\u2014Debit and Credit, your students will discover the answer to that question. They will also realize that credit cards and debit cards are different, and each one can be helpful in different ways.\n\nCredit cards and debit cards are both small, hard, plastic cards. But apart from that, they are quite difference. Credit cards, for instance, are not linked to a bank account, but debit cards are. That means you can use debit cards to pay for things with money you already have. Generally speaking, a debit card is directly linked to a checking account. Credit cards use money that is loaned. You can use it to buy something and pay for it later.\n\nCredit card companies issue credit cards, and it's like a type of loan. You can pay back the loan according to the credit company's schedule. You usually have to make a minimum payment each month to reduce your debt. They can also charge interest if it takes you longer to pay the money back or if you don't pay the full amount back every month. However, if you pay your credit card bills in full every month, you won't be charged any interest.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important skills!

Financial Literacy\u2014Making a Budget explains how to create a budget based on your income and expenses. This will help your kids learn how to use a spending plan in order to use their money wisely.\n\nBudgeting is a great skill to have that will help you learn how to save for something you want to buy. A budget is a spending plan to based on your income and expenses. In other words, it estimates how much money your earn and spend over time. Expenses can be either fixed or variable. Fixed expenses are the same every time you have to pay them. Variable expenses, well, vary.\n\nTo make a budget, you have to look are how much money your earn or receive as gifts (income). Then you look at your expenses. Subtracting your expenses from your income gives you the amount of money you have left over to spend on something you want. You must be careful to watch out for unexpected expenses though, which can put a dent in that budge of yours!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the difference between a need and a want!

      "description": "As we discussed in the introduction video to this series, deciding between needs and wants can be tough. Financial Literacy\u2014Needs and Wants explains the difference between needs versus wants. But it goes further and describes what opportunity cost is. This will help your kids learn how to make decisions, not between needs and wants, but wants and more wants.\n\nA need, as you now know, is something that is necessary to your survival. Food, water, and shelter are needs because we have to have those things in order to survive. Wants include way more things because there are lots of things in this world that we don't have to have to survive. Toys, games, books, subscriptions to stuff. While it may be hard to decide between a need and want, sometimes it's even harder to decide between two wants. \n\nOpportunity cost relates to decisions between wants. It is basically the cost of missing out on the option you do not choose. The video offers an example in which Frankie Finance has to choose between a pair of rollerblades she has saved up for and going to the movies with her friends. The rollerblades cost more than she has, but there will be a sale to bring down the price to one she can afford. \n\nIf Frankie chooses the rollerblades, she will miss out on a movie night with her friends. If she chooses to go to the movie, she will not be able to afford the rollerblades, which will be on sale for one day only. If she doesn't buy them then, she will not be able to get them. There is an opportunity cost tied to each decision. One thing you can do to help you make decisions like this is to create a pros and cons list!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the difference between a need and a want!

      "description": "What exactly are vitamins and minerals? Many people think these two substances are the same, but they are not. But they are both important to keep our bodies strong and healthy. Vitamins are organic substances, meaning that plants and animals produce them. Minerals are inorganic and come from the soil and water. Then they are absorbed by plants or eaten by animals.\n\nVitamins are divided into two categories\u2014fat soluble or water soluble. Which category a vitamin falls into depends on whether it dissolves best in fats or in water. The fat-soluble vitamins can be stored in the body, but the water-soluble vitamins need to dissolve in water before the body can absorb them. In addition, the body can\u2019t store water-soluble vitamins. For this reason, we need a fresh supply of water-soluble vitamins each day.\n\nWhen it comes to minerals, our bodies cannot break down or change them. Minerals can, however, form part of the structure of bones, teeth, nails, muscles, and red blood cells. There are several minerals the body needs. Calcium is one of the most common minerals. Our bodies need calcium to build and protect bones and teeth, support our muscles, and help with blood clots and nerves. \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these essential nutrients!

      "description": "When you think of Halloween, do you ever think of Ireland? Well, turns out, most of our Halloween traditions, including the name, come from the Celts! Dressing up in disguises is all thanks to the Samhein festival. Even our tradition of pumpkin carving originated from an Irish folk tale. \n\nHalloween is one of the oldest traditions in world history and comes from the Celts. It marked the end of summer and beginning of fall/winter season. That's why it's celebrated in the fall. The Celts passed down their history and culture orally, meaning they didn't write any of it down. Druids, or Celtic priests, were the ones responsible for passing it on to the next generation.\n\nThe Celts believed people transitions from physically living on Earth to living in a spiritual world when they died. During the Samhein festival, the Celts would stock up on supplies for the winter and welcome guests from the afterlife. If spirits appeared that had been wronged by a living person, the living person would disguise themselves with masks or with ashes from a fire. This was called guising, and it's where the word disguise comes from!

      "description": "What are the differences between a freshwater turtle and a sea turtle? In Turtles for Kids, you'll learn the answer! As the name suggests, freshwater turtles love to live in rivers, lakes, and ponds. They have strong legs with webbed feet that make them excellent swimmers. On the other hand, sea turtles prefer to live in the big blue ocean. They have unique flippers instead of legs, which help them gracefully glide through the water.\n\nTheir diets differ too. Freshwater turtles are little chefs that create a menu filled with aquatic plants, insects, small fish, and even worms. They are omnivores and use their sharp beaks to munch on plants and small animals.Sea turtles have a slightly different taste in their underwater menu. These ocean wanderers are mostly herbivores and primarily dine on sea grasses and algae. Their strong beaks help them nip at the plants, making them efficient grazers in marine habitats. Sea turtles are also known to eat jellyfish and small invertebrates occasionally, adding a bit of variety to their diet.\n\nDespite a few other differences, freshwater and sea turtles are pretty similar when it comes to caring for their little ones. They both lay eggs in nests during a process called oviparous reproduction. Mama turtles carefully choose a good spot on land to bury their eggs. Then, they leave them to hatch on their own. Once the baby turtles hatch, they start their journey to the water. It's like a turtle family tradition\u2014laying eggs on land and letting the little ones walk into the sea after they hatch to begin their adventure.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these aquatic reptiles!

      "description": "Did you know gorillas are as strong as bulldozers? In fact, they are one of the strongest animals on the planet! In Gorillas for Kids, you'll learn exactly why that is. Gorillas use their strong arms and hands to gather food and build comfortable nests for resting. This strength also helps them swing from tree branches and move through their thick forest homes. And, of course, it helps them protect the troop, maintain order, and defend their territory.\n\nWhen it comes to hygiene, gorillas are experts at grooming each other. Grooming is when an animal carefully cleans the fur of other group members. Gorillas use their fingers to pick out dirt, leaves, and parasites from each other's fur. This grooming behavior serves several vital purposes. First, it helps gorillas build and strengthen their social bonds. Second, it helps gorillas stay healthy and clean. Through grooming, they can avoid infections and keep their coats in good condition.\n\nGorillas are wonderful parents. They treat their young ones with a lot of care and love. Baby gorillas are called infants, and their moms are very protective of them. Moms carry their infants on their backs to keep them close. As the young gorillas grow, they learn essential things from their moms and the rest of the troop, such as what to eat and how to behave. This helps them grow up strong and prepares them to live on their own in the forest one day.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about such interesting apes!

      "description": "What do you know about the famous scavenger birds\u2014vultures? In Vultures for kids, you'll learn a whole lot about these amazing birds and how important they are to the environment. After all, they are janitors in their wild world. They play a significant role in the environment by eating animals\nthat have passed away, consuming roadkill or the remains of animals in the wild. This helps prevent these carcasses from spreading diseases and keeps the environment clean.\n\nDespite their somewhat scary nature, vultures are caring parents. When their chicks are born, vulture parents take turns keeping them warm and feeding them. They regurgitate food from their stomachs to feed their hungry chicks. Chicks stay with their parents until they grow strong and can learn to fly independently.\n\nHow vultures find their meals is pretty cool. They have excellent eyesight that helps them spot carrion from way high up in the sky. They can also smell really well, which makes it easy to detect the smell of dead animals, even from a distance. When a vulture finds a meal, it usually lands next to it and uses its sharp beak to tear into the carcass and get to the meat. So instead of hunting, vultures get to find animals that are already gone and help recycle them back into the ecosystem.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these bald birds!

      "description": "Do you know what a mollusk is? If you said snail, you'd be right, but not fully. In this video for kids, you'll learn that snails are just one member of the Mollusca phylum. In fact, you'd discover that snails and clams and octopuses are RELATED! They're all mollusks of some kind. There are three main groups\u2014gastropoda (snails), bivalvia (clams, oysters, and mussels), and cephalopoda (squid and octopuses).\n\nGastropoda is the most diverse group. These are the snails, and there are tens of thousands of them. Almost all snails grow shells in one spiraled piece. But there are some that stopped growing shells; these are what we call slugs! Bivalvia have two shells instead of one, which is why clams, oysters, and mussels are part of this group. Cephalopods only live in salt water, which is why you wouldn't find squid and octopuses living on land. They don't have shells either as most other mollusks do. This group is fast, larger, and more intelligent than the other two groups. \n\nScientists have discovered about 100,000 species of mollusk all over the world, but there are still many more out there to be found. There are probably tens of thousands of undiscovered mollusks! These animals are either terrestrial (on the land) or aquatic (in the water). Most live in the salty ocean water, but some live in freshwater. Mollusks are invertebrate animals, which means they do not have a backbone and are cold-blooded.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these unique invertebrates!

In this video for kids, you'll discover fun facts about the animals that belong to this phylum, including jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones.\n\nCnidaria is a phylum that contains more than 10,000 species that live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. There are five classes of cnidarians, and jellyfish are found in four of them! What makes these animals unique is specialized cells called cnidocytes, which they use for capturing prey. They're basically stinging cells.\n\nCnidarians don't have any respiratory organs, but they absorb oxygen from the water and expel carbon dioxide. They also have no central nervous system, like a brain. But they do have a collection of neural tissue that could possibly be a processing center. These unique animals also have the ability to regenerate! So if they lose a certain part, it can grow back!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "What makes a python so interesting? In Pythons for Kids, you'll discover that these giant snakes have many qualities that distinguish them from other serpents. Pythons are also well known for their beautiful scales. You can determine the type of python based on its unique colors and patterns. These scales are made of keratin, just like our hair and fingernails. Scales are not just for looks\u2014they\nprotect the python and help it move smoothly through its environment.\n\nPythons are expert hunters. They use a technique called constriction to catch their prey. When a python spots its dinner, it slowly and silently approaches, being very sneaky. Then, it strikes out quickly, using its sharp teeth to grab onto the animal. Once the python has a good hold, it coils its body around the prey, squeezing it tightly. By squeezing (or constricting), the python makes it hard for the prey to breathe and eventually chokes it to death. This is how the python captures its dinner. The python then opens its hinged jaws to swallow the animal whole!\n\nThese snakes are usually solitary animals, which means they like to live alone. But sometimes, you might find a group of pythons together, especially during the breeding season. When it comes to taking care of their babies, pythons do something called brooding. They lay eggs and then coil their bodies around them to keep them warm and safe until they hatch. It's like being wrapped in a cozy blanket! This helps the baby pythons, called hatchlings, stay protected and grow strong until they're ready to go out on their own.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these bald birds!

      "description": "If you had to guess whether rhinoceroses were carnivores, omnivores, or herbivores, what would you say? Rhinos for Kids will teach you that the answer is herbivores! They have a plant-based diet that consists of grass, leaves, branches, and fruits. Scientists consider the rhino both a browser and a grazer. Grazing refers to when rhinos nibble on grass and other plants on the ground. But they also browse, which means they use their strong lips and teeth to pluck leaves and branches from trees and bushes. You could think of them like the giant lawnmowers of the savanna.\n\nWhen caring for their little ones, rhino moms are very protective. They use their muscular bodies to keep their babies safe from danger. Baby rhinos, called calves, stay close to their moms. While in their mother's care, they learn how to find food and stay safe in the wild. It's like going to school with their mom as their teacher!\n\nSadly, many species of rhinoceros are endangered today and at risk of disappearing from the wild forever. This is mainly because of poaching. Poaching (or illegal hunting) has caused a severe decline in rhino populations. Some people hunt them because they believe that rhino horns have unique, almost magical properties, even though no scientific proof of this exists. Conservationists and scientists are working very hard to protect these amazing animals and their habitats to ensure that they continue to positively impact the environment\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these marvelous mammals!

      "description": "Did you know that octopuses have the largest brains of all the known invertebrates in the world? Octopuses for Kids lays out quite a few quirky facts, like the fact that they have brains in their arms too! Each arm has a bunch of neurons that work together to help an octopus move in a coordinated way. All these brains make octopuses incredibly intelligent.\n\nWhen octopuses need to protect themselves, they use an incredible strategy called autotomy. If an octopus is in danger, it will purposely \"let go\" of one of its arms. It can then escape its predators because its detached arm keeps moving as a distraction while the octopus makes a safe getaway. Even more amazing is that octopuses can grow a new arm later.\n\nHere another cool fact. Octopuses have chromatophores in their skin. Chromatophores are specialized cells containing pigments that allow them to change color and create intricate patterns. These cells help them hide by matching the colors and patterns of their surroundings, like rocks or seaweed. That way, if an octopus is near a sandy area, it can turn brown to blend in, and if it's by a coral reef, it can turn the vibrant colors of the corals. Octopuses use this remarkable skill not just for camouflage but also to communicate with other octopuses and express their emotions.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these intelligent invertebrates!

      "description": "What in the world is a man o' war? In Man o' Wars for Kids, you'll discover that these fascinating marine creatures floating on the ocean's surface drift along with ocean currents and live in warm ocean waters, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Man o' wars are not generally social animals. They do not form groups the way other animals do. However, they can sometimes be seen floating in a cluster due to ocean currents and wind patterns. Still, each man o' war in a cluster remains a separate colony.\n\nMan o' wars eat small fish, plankton, and other tiny sea creatures. And they have a distinctive way of catching their food. They don't use regular mouths and teeth to eat the way humans do. Instead, they have long, trailing tentacles that float in the water. These tentacles are filled with tiny, harpoon-like structures called nematocysts. The nematocysts help trap the prey in the man o' war's tentacles.\n\nWhile man o' wars are indeed beautiful with their striking colors and sail-like floats, they are also dangerous. Their tiny, venomous, harpoon-like nematocysts don't just hurt tiny fish. If a swimmer accidentally brushes against them, it can result in a painful sting. Even though man o' wars look stunning, it's important to admire them from a safe distance. Like the thorns on a rose, the tentacles on a man o' war are sharp and painful when touched. And even if the colony is dead, the tentacles can still sting!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these odd sea creatures!

      "description": "Did you know that sharks have been in the oceans for over 400 million years? That means sharks were swimming in the oceans before the dinosaurs existed. And they haven\u2019t changed much over time. While sharks often have a bad reputation, they are amazing animals that don\u2019t want to hurt humans. Their enormous mouths and super sharp teeth make them one of the most frightening animals on the planet.\n\nThere are as many different eating habits as there are sharks. Most sharks are carnivores and very efficient predators. They eat fish, mollusks, and crustaceans. Large sharks will also eat dolphins, seals, sea lions, tuna, and mackerel. But some like to eat seabirds and even plankton! And tiger sharks prefer turtles while blue sharks enjoy squid. What they eat and what is available depends on where the sharks live. Different types of prey live in other parts of the ocean.\n\nThe demand for fins, overfishing, and human disturbance threaten shark populations. It is important not to eat shark fin soup and to know which fish species you purchase at the market. A quarter of the world\u2019s shark species are currently threatened with extinction. In addition, climate change is forcing sharks to move to waters they are not familiar with. Though climate change dramatically affects the shark habitat and behavior, commercial fishing remains the greatest threat to the shark population.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these fascinating fish!

      "description": "Did you know that a bear's closest relatives are aquatic? It's true! In Bears for Kids, you'll discover that bears are related to walruses, seals, and sea lions. And even though koalas are often called koala bears, they are marsupials and not bears at all! And have you ever seen a picture of a bear holding a honey jar? That\u2019s because all bears love the sweet taste of honey! But they eat more than just honey. Each bear species has a different preferred diet, but they are all considered omnivores because they eat plants and animals. \n\nFor example, polar bears mostly eat seals, while giant pandas mainly eat bamboo and some small animals. American black bears love the taste of berries and insect larvae, while brown bears in Alaska gorge (greedily eat a large amount) on salmon by plucking them right out of the stream as they jump. And sloth bears are super-fast eaters even though they are called sloths which means lazy. They can tear a hole in a termite mound and inhale a whole meal in seconds!\n\nBears are mammals that can be as small as 4 feet long or as big as 8 feet long. There are eight species, or types, of bears. They are brown bears, Asian black bears, American black bears, sloth bears, polar bears, spectacled bears, sun bears, and giant panda bears. Sadly, six of these species are considered threatened or vulnerable. These large, lumbering animals move slowly and awkwardly and walk on all four paws, but they can raise up on their hind legs when needed.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these amazing animals!

      "description": "Did you know the most common type of natural disaster in the US is flooding? Nearly 90% of all disasters actually involve flooding in some way. In this video for kids, you'll discover that floods can result from tropical storms, hurricanes, extreme rains, or even thawing snow. \n\nA flood is an overflow of water onto what is normally dry land. They can be a few inches high to dozens of feet high depending on the circumstance. They form in many different ways, such as melting ice, hurricanes, or the breaking of a dam or other barrier. \n\nThere are three types of floods\u2014slow onset, rapid onset, and flash. Slow onset means that the flood happens gradually, over a long period of time, within days or even weeks. Rapid onset, on the other hand, means that the flood happens really quickly, usually within a day or two. Finally, flash floods are those that happen during a VERY short period of time, usually between a couple hours. These floods can be very dangerous and cause a lot of destruction.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this natural disaster!

      "description": "Of over 3,000 snake species, around 700 are venomous, and 250 of those 700 are capable of killing a human with one bite! In this video for kids, you'll learn lots of facts about these predators. Venomous snakes have two grooved or hollow needle-pointed teeth called fangs. These fangs connect to glands that hold the poisonous venom. When a snake bites, the muscles contract and release the venom through the ducts in their fangs. This is how they inject venom into their prey.\n\nSnakes are carnivores, which means they only eat other animals. Which animals they eat depends on the size of the snake's body. Small snakes eat rodents, birds, and insects while bigger snakes eat deer, pigs, and alligators or crocodiles. In addition, snakes have a unique way of eating. They have stretchy ligaments that allow them to open their mouths wide enough to swallow their prey whole. They never chew their food! It can take a snake anywhere from a couple days to weeks to finish the meal they catch.\n\nSadly, snakes are under serious threat. Threats to snakes include habitat destruction, city development, and disease, and people kill them as well. As a result, many snake species are endangered, and some are on the brink of extinction. While you may not love snakes, we must respect their right to live on the planet with us because they play an essential role in maintaining biodiversity.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about venomous snake species!

      "description": "Did you know that owls live in almost every type of habitat? Owls for Kids will present lots of fun and interesting facts about these hooting birds. Speaking of hoots, not all owls hoot. Barn owls make hissing sounds, Eastern screech owls whinny like a horse, and saw-whet owls sound like a sharpening saw. Owls make various sounds, including snapping their bills, clapping their wings in flight, and singing. They can make facial expressions too because they have many tiny facial muscles. And just like you, they use their facial expressions to communicate with other owls.\n\nMost owls eat small animals like mice, rabbits, and voles. But some owl species will also dine on insects and birds. Their diet ultimately depends on the species because the environment in which they live will determine what they eat. All owls are carnivorous, but their diet has to do with the climate of the habitat and its geographic location.\n\nHere's another fun fact: owls have asymmetrical ears, meaning that they're not exactly the same. Not only are their ears shaped differently, but they are also located at different heights on their head. This allows them to pinpoint the location of sounds in multiple dimensions, giving them a significant advantage over their prey.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful birds!

      "description": "Many people think a tortoise and a turtle are the same animal, but that is only kind of true. In this video for kids, you'll realize that technically, all tortoises are also turtles, but not all turtles are tortoises. One key difference is that tortoises spend most of their time on land and turtles spend most of theirs in water. So tortoises are almost exclusively land-dwelling. But most other turtles, on the other hand, are aquatic, meaning they enjoy life in the water. \n\nTortoises are very adaptable. Over time, they changed to eat different types of plants. Biologists noticed that some species had different types of necks. Those living on islands with tall plants had longer necks, and their shells around the neck are pointed upward to allow them to reach higher places. In contrast, those living on islands with low-growing plants did not have long necks or an upturned section of shell.\n\nTortoises are important to the environment because they spread seeds and disperse spores for many plants, trees, and fungi. But sadly, many tortoise species are endangered because humans have hunted them. In many cultures, tortoises have been considered a delicacy (a rare and expensive food item), so people have hunted them to eat. Humans have also collected and traded tortoise shells. To help save this precious animal, many zookeepers have made their zoos the tortoises' homes. And thanks to conservationists, the giant tortoises have increased in numbers.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these ancient reptiles!

They make homes in various spots, from burrows in the ground to cozy caves. Coyotes are the ultimate survival experts because they can adapt to multiple environments\u2014that's impressive!\n\nWhen it comes to food, coyotes are skilled hunters, and they eat a variety of things. They are omnivores, which means they enjoy both meat and plants. Their favorite meals include small animals like rabbits, mice, and birds. But they're not picky eaters; they also munch on fruits, berries, and insects. This diverse diet helps them survive and stay healthy.\n\nCoyotes are not endangered at all! Remember, coyotes are pretty good at adapting to different environments, which is why they can be found in many places across North and Central America. They are survivors because they're so good at finding food and homes. You don't have to worry that coyotes will disappear from the wild anytime soon. They're here to stay and continue doing their important job in our ecosystems!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these adaptable animals!

      "description": "Did you know that whales aren't fish, but mammals like us? In Whales for Kids, you'll learn that whales breathe air, have hair, are warm-blooded, give live births to their young, and feed their young milk. They are quite large\u2014much bigger than humans. In fact, a whale's size can range from 9 to 98 feet! They can be as small as the 600-pound dwarf sperm whale or weigh more than 200 tons, like the colossal blue whale. Imagine the average house (approximately 2,000 square feet), and you have some idea how heavy 200 tons is.\n\nThere are two types of whales: toothed and baleen. Toothed whales use their teeth for hunting and eating. This group includes sperm whales and orcas, as well as dolphins, porpoises, and narwhals. Speaking of narwhals, a narwhal's horn is actually one long tooth protruding or sticking out through its lip! Baleen whales are larger than toothed whales and include blue whales, humpbacks, bowhead whales, and many others. They eat by straining creatures through the fringed plates of long, fingernail-like material called baleen.\n\nFor a long time, people hunted whales, and blue whales are now rare because of widespread\ncommercial hunting. Other whale populations have ended up on the verge of extinction. Scientists believe that ending the practice of whale hunting, improving commercial fishing practices, and making efforts to clean the environment have improved whales' chances of long-term survival.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these outstanding ocean inhabitants!

      "description": "What is pollination? And what animals are responsible for making it happen? In this video for kids, you'll learn all about it. Pollination is a process that produces seeds, fruits, and young plants. It happens when a pollen grain moves from the flower's anther (male part) to the stigma (female part). Wind and water help to transfer pollen and some plants self-pollinate. But most plants are pollinated through the hard work of insects and animals. These insects and animals move pollen from one blooming flower to another to fertilize the plant.\n\nBees, wasps, moths, butterflies, birds, flies, and small mammals like bats use flowers for different reasons. Some search for food and shelter, while others search for nesting materials or mates. Pollinators may move pollen on purpose, while others do it by accident. Pollen often sticks to their bodies while inside a flower bloom drinking or feeding on nectar. Then as they move from flower to flower, it is transported, resulting in pollination.\n\nPollinators are important to the environment because they help to build healthy ecosystems. Plants stabilize soil, clean the air, supply oxygen for us to breathe, and support many wildlife creatures' diets. Without pollinators, there might not be enough young plants to keep everything going. But pollinator populations are changing, and many of them are in decline. We can all help to reverse this by creating home gardens full of flowers for hungry pollinators. In addition, many farmers plant flowering plants or maintain beehives near their crops to help pollinate the growing plants.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important pollinators!

      "description": "You may not familiar with the word echinoderm, but you would probably recognize some of them if you saw them! The word comes from Latin and means spiny skin. (But some echinoderms have more bumpy than spiny skin, to be fair.) In this video for kids, you'll learn some interesting facts about the phylum Echinodermata and the animals that belong to it.\n\nHave you ever seen or touched a starfish? Starfish, which have that iconic bumpy skin, are echinoderms, as are sea cucumbers and sea urchins. They look pretty dissimilar, but they have quite a bit in common. For instance, all echinoderms can only live in the ocean and are invertebrates, so they don't have a backbone. They also all have radial symmetry, which means you can divide their bodies into five identical pieces. In comparison, humans have bilateral symmetry, meaning two identical halves.\n\nThe underside of an echinoderm reveals tube feet, part of their water vascular system. This system is a network of fluid-filled canals that extend along each of the five body regions. Tube feet help the animal move, eat, and even breathe. And these cool feet are how echinoderms stick to the ocean floor or to the side of an aquarium.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "Have you ever thought about where hamsters come from, that they lived (and still live) in the wild before they were household pets? In this video for kids, you'll learn lots more. Hamsters are small mammals with round bodies that are covered in soft fur. They have short legs and small ears that wiggle when they're excited. But what's really special about hamsters is their cheek pouches. These pouches are tiny spaces in their cheeks where they can store food to munch on later. It's like having a snack on the go!\n\nSpeaking of food, hamsters use their specialized cheek pouches to collect and transport food back to their burrows. These expandable pouches can stretch to accommodate a surprisingly large amount of food, allowing the furry rodents to carry provisions to their nest for storage or later consumption. The cheek pouches are like a built-in grocery bag! This unique adaptation helps hamsters efficiently gather and store food, ensuring they have readily available sustenance, whether for a midnight snack or to share with their fellow colony members.\n\nIf there was a competition for digging, hamsters would definitely take home the gold medal! Hamsters are experts at tunneling and burrowing. In fact, they can create an elaborate network of tunnels in their bedding or substrate in just one night. These tunnels provide them with shelter and protection and mimic their natural habitat in the wild.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these adorable animals!

      "description": "Is an American eagle the same as a bald eagle? Why, yes it is! American Eagles for Kids explores interesting facts about this majestic bird. Most people refer to bald eagles as just that\u2014bald eagles. But because it's the national bird of the USA, we tend to call it the American eagle. The word bald in this case comes from an Old English word that meant white and referred to feathers.\n\nAmerican eagles fly high in the sky and live near large inland lakes and rivers that have lots and lots of fish. They typically build their nests at the tops of trees, and even enlarge their nests every year. In fact, these nests can be as wide as 10 feet and as heavy as a thousand pounds! This might seem big, but keep in mind that bald eagles are rather large, with up to a 7-foot wing span. They need that room to spread their wings!\n\nBald eagles are essential to the environment. They eat carrion, which helps keep the land clean. Because they are great hunters, they also help balance animal populations. This beautiful bird once came close to extinction in the 1960s and were officially put on the endangered animals list in 1976. However, thanks to many conservation efforts, the American eagle downgraded from the endangered to the threatened list.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this special bird!

      "description": "Dolphins are among the most unique mammals. In Dolphins for Kids, you will learn all about these beautiful creatures. Despite the fact that they look like really big fish, they are not! They breathe air, give live birth to their young, nurse their babies with milk, have hair at some point, and are warm-blooded.\n\nDid you know that dolphins are actually part of the larger group of animals called whales? (And did you know the killer whale is a species of dolphin?) Dolphins come in different colors, like black, white, or grey. Their skin is smooth and rubbery, like a bar of slippery soap. They have a flipper on either side of their body and a triangular-shaped fin on their backs. Dolphins look a lot like porpoises, so people often confuse the two.\n\nGenerally, dolphins live in groups called pods that usually range from 2 to 30 dolphins. During mating season, they form superpods that can have hundreds of dolphins! How do they keep track of each other? Well, one really interesting fact about dolphins is that they have names. Each dolphin is given a unique whistle right after their birth. They learn their whistle from their mother.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this intelligent marine mammal!

      "description": "What is a graphic organizer? In this video for kids, your students or kids will learn about several types of graphic organizers that they can use to take notes or organize information. They are likely very familiar with Venn diagrams, which are easy to create and understand. Venn diagrams are an excellent way to compare and contrast information.\n\nBut what about when you want to simply make connections or show a chain of events or sequence? There are plenty other types of organizers that allow us to evaluate things differently. One is a circle map, which helps you define things. You could write a main idea, such as sharks, and then write what you already know and what new information you learn. Similar to the circle map, another type is a prior knowledge chart. The main topic is in the center. The outer circles can include new information, things you would like to know, or things you already know.\n\nText connects help you better recall information you have read. Chain or sequence of events organizers allow you to show different steps in a process, or the chain of events that lead to a discovery. You can organize them in different ways as well. The last organizer we discuss is main idea and details, which works really well for nonfiction passages. You can write the main ideas from different paragraphs then write out their supporting details.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these different ways to organize your notes!

      "description": "Did you know that over 8 million metric tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year? In our Importance of Oceans for Kids video, we discuss why it's so essential to take care of the water that covers our beautiful earth. In fact, seawater makes up two-thirds of our planet! Most of that water flows in the five interconnected oceans. And this water provides us with so many important benefits.\n\nThe ocean is vital to our planet because it produces over half of the world's oxygen supply. It also absorbs 50 times more carbon that the atmosphere. We can also turn to the ocean for food, transportation, and recreation. When it comes to food supply, we are talking about more than just fish. Did you know that ingredients in peanut butter and soymilk are also found in the ocean? In addition, the ocean helps regulate weather patterns, creates employment opportunities, and provides ingredients for medicines.\n\nOcean mining and plastic pollution are two major problems for our oceans. Ocean mining produces plumes of sediment that blanket sections of the ocean floor. It chokes filter-feeding species and the fish swimming amidst the debris and destroys habitats. Plastic is a major concern because it doesn't decompose. The constant movement in the water simply breaks it down into smaller pieces called microplastics. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of debris between Hawai'i and California that is twice the size of Texas. This floating mass of plastic is estimated to be 80,000 tons.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the world's beautiful ocean!

      "description": "We all know the ocean is huge. But what else do we know? Ocean Facts for Kids offers just a few more interesting facts that you and your kids might not already know. For instance, almost 98% of all the water on the earth is in the ocean. The average depth is 2.3 miles deep. And that's just the average! One of the deepest parts is at the Mariana Trench, which is 36,198 feet deep\u2014almost seven miles!\n\nDo you know why there are waves? The most common type of wave is a surface wave. These are the ones we commonly see with the white tips that crash into the shore. These waves are caused by wind blowing across the surface of the ocean. Other waves occur because of gravity. These waves are called tides, which are affected by the moon's location in relation to the earth. And waves can even happen because of underwater explosions from volcanoes beneath the surface of the ocean. These explosions cause tsunamis!\n\nLarge parts of the ocean remain a mystery. Marine biologists estimate that there are between 700,000 and 1 million species that live in this ginormous pool. They also think that two-thirds of those species haven't even been discovered yet! That estimate doesn't include the millions of microorganisms living in the ocean.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the world's beautiful ocean!

      "description": "Did you know you are a chordate? In this kids video, you'll learn a lot of interesting facts about chordates. All chordates are grouped into the phylum because, at some point in their life, they have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits (gills near the pharynx), and a muscular tail. The tail could remain into adulthood or disappear during embryonic development. They also all have a closed circulatory system with blood that flows through vessels and a heart with ventricles.\n\nScientists think the very first vertebrates evolved around 525 million years ago, but they can\u2019t determine if it was Myllokunmingia or Pikaia gracilens. Try to say those words really fast! So while it feels like most of our planet is covered in vertebrates, only about 5% of all animal species are vertebrates.\n\nAll vertebrates have a backbone, an endoskeleton, two pairs of appendages, a skull, and a bilateral symmetry. And the animals in this phylum include mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, birds, and amphibians. Keep in mind that all vertebrates are chordates, but not all chordates are vertebrates!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "Did you know that several million earthquakes happen every year? Earthquakes for Kids STEM is a great video to learn a little more about earthquakes. Most earthquakes are so small in magnitude that we can't feel them. The United States Geological Survey only records about 20 each year in the US.\n\nThe reason earthquakes happen in the first place has to do with the tectonic plates below the surface of the earth. Tectonic plates move around constantly. Those movements cause tension, which in turn causes huge faults or cracks in the rocks. The faults sometimes get stuck, and when they get unstuck, they cause an earthquake! Tectonic plates move in three ways: subduction, lateral sliding, and spreading.\n\nThe closer you are to an earthquake's epicenter, the more strongly you will feel it. This is because an earthquake loses its intensity as it travels away from the epicenter. Scientists measure the intensity of an earthquake using a seismograph, which detects and measures the vibrations of the earthquake. The magnitude of the earthquake is the number we assign to record its size. A magnitude of 5.5 if considered moderate. Above 8.0 means it's a major earthquake. And earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.5 or lower are usually not felt at all.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about earthquakes!

      "description": "What do you know about penguins? You probably know they can't fly and instead swim effortlessly in water. (In fact, they can swim up to 25 miles an hour!) In Penguins for Kids, you'll learn a lot more cool facts about these unique birds! For one, not all of them live in cold places, as in Antarctica. Some actually live in warmer climates off the coast of Ecuador!\n\nThe majority of penguins are between one and four feet tall and have the iconic black backs and white bellies. This coloring gives off an effect called countershading that helps them avoid predators. They eat small fishes, squid, and other ocean animals. But it doesn't matter what these meals taste like because penguins have no sense of taste! Scientists examined their DNA and learned that no penguins can taste sweet, bitter, or umami flavors.\n\nRight now, penguins struggle to battle climate change, overfishing, and water pollution. They have to deal with habitat destruction and new predators, too. Their food supply starts to dwindle, which means they have to swim further and further out to find food. This can be dangerous for them. Some species, like the yellow-eyed penguin, are in danger of extinction. There are only about 4,000 left.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting birds!

      "description": "Did you know that mammals, reptiles, birds, fish, and amphibians all have quite a few traits in common? In this video for kids, you and your students will learn all about the different animals that belong to a group we call vertebrates. When you think of vertebrates, you probably think of the presence of a backbone. But there are even more common traits among these unique animals.\n\nThere are five key characteristics that distinguish vertebrates from other animals. They have backbones, skulls, endoskeletons, bilateral symmetry, and two pairs of appendages. These traits allow their muscles to attach to points that can be used for movement. All vertebrates also have a heart and kidneys.\n\nVertebrates further classify into seven classes based on their anatomical features. These classes are mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, bony fish, cartilaginous fish, and jawless fish. Mammals are endothermic so they can regulate their body temperature. Birds have feathers and toothless beaks. They also lay hard-shelled eggs. Reptiles also lay eggs. Reptiles include snakes and crocodiles. Amphibians are a little unique in that they undergo metamorphosis as they go from birth to adulthood.\n\nThe fish group divides into three classes: bony fish, cartilaginous fish, and jawless fish. Bony fish, like seahorses, have a skeleton made of bone rather than cartilage. Bony fish is the largest class of vertebrates. Sharks and rays are examples of cartilaginous fish. Primitive fish like hagfish belong to the jawless fish category.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this small group of animals!

      "description": "What does it take to make a rainbow? Are there two points at which the rainbow touches the earth's surface? In this video for kids, you will learn all about the science behind how a rainbow forms. It takes three simple ingredients: light, water, and you!\n\nLight is important because rainbows are actually made of light. The white light we see from the sun actually contains seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. When light enters a raindrop, it bends or refracts, and all the colors band together on the other side. That's what makes the light appear in a ribbon of color.\n\nRainbows appear in an arc shape. When the sun is low in the sky, the arc looks tall. When the sun is higher up, the arc of the rainbow is lower. But believe it or not, rainbows don't have an arc shape. It's an optical illusion! If you are in an airplane and you see a rainbow, it will be in a circular shape. All rainbows are circular.\n\nSome rainbows appear at night, and we call these moonbows. Moonbows appear as a faint circle around the moon. They are usually not easy to see, and sometimes they even look white instead of colorful. There are also double rainbows and upside-down rainbows. Upside-down are very rare, and they actually only occur when light bends through the thin screen of tiny ice crystals high in the sky.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this beautiful natural phenomenon!

      "description": "You've probably heard the story of Little Red Riding Hood, right? What we learn from that book is that wolves have large ears and eyes, big snouts, and sharp teeth. It's true! Wolves are actually the apex predators of their environments. They are also the ancestors of our domesticated dogs. They can be as long as six feet from nose to tail and weigh between 50 and 100 pounds. \n\nThese carnivores travel in groups called packs. The pack members are often family members, but lone wolves will join a pack if they don't have one of their own. Packs range from as small as 2 wolves to as many as 25. They eat mostly large or medium hoofed animals, but they occasionally consume birds, rodents, or even fish if they can't find any bigger prey. And the alpha male and female eat before the rest of the pack.\n\nWolves have an excellent sense of smell. In fact, it is 100 times stronger than a human's sense of smell. They can detect other animals up to a mile away! Just as humans use much of their brain capacity to process images, wolves use a considerable part of their brains to process smell.\n\nWhile they are apex predators and are at the top of their food chain, they do have to deal with humans, their only predators. They are becoming more and more endangered due to pollution, industrial growth, and natural disasters. Luckily, they were reintroduced into Yellowstone National Park to breed after not living there due to poisoned water and hunting.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this exciting apex predator!

      "description": "What do you know about spiders? In this video for kids, you'll probably learn a lot of facts you didn't know before. Spiders are arachnids, which are members of the larger group of arthropods. Arachnids include spiders, mites, ticks, and scorpions. All arachnids have eight legs. Biologists say there are an estimated 43,000 and possibly as many as 45,000 spider species. Although most spiders are venomous, only 30 species can be harmful to humans. But you have to be very careful because some venomous spiders can kill humans! \n\nSpiders eat mainly mosquitos, flies, and moths. Sometimes, they even eat other spiders! While most spiders eat primarily insects, larger spiders also eat worms, snails, frogs, lizards, and birds. Most spider species passively catch their prey by spinning complex webs. When insects cross paths with the web, they get stuck on the sticky threads. The spider carefully walks along the path of dry threads to get to the insect and then uses its fangs to inject venom into the trapped insect. The toxin kills or paralyzes the insect, allowing the spider to eat its dinner without a fuss.\n\nSpiders all over the world are suffering from human activity. When people cut down trees, use pesticides, and graze animals on large areas of land, the spider population starts to decrease. So next time you see a spider, don't stomp on it\u2014just trap it in a glass and take it back outside!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these spectacular arachnids!

If you like, you can download the lesson plan to follow along (link below).\n\nRight off the bat, you can probably tell a few differences between bees and wasps, such as the fact that bees seem hairy while wasps look shiny and smooth. That's because bees tend to have hair that makes them look fuzzy. In fact, their fuzzy bodies help them collect and spread pollen. Wasps have slimmer bodies and aren't quite as good as bees at disseminating pollen.\n\nTheir diets differ as well. Bees tend to consume pollen and nectar, which is the sweet fluid that flowers produce. Wasps are natural predators, on the other hand. They feed arthropods and other insects to their young. They are aggressive hunters that leave their nests specifically to look for food. However, they do occasionally focus on collecting sweets during the later summer and fall months.\n\nBoth bees and wasps are extremely important to the environment. They help distribute pollen to cross-pollinate plants, which helps produce so much of our food sources! Wasps help keep the arthropod population under control as well. Without them, we would have way too many caterpillars, spiders, and flies. Sadly, the bee populations continue to decline. \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these hard-working bugs!

      "description": "What is the difference between a buffalo and a bison? This video for kids explains that there are no buffalo in the United States (unless you can find one in a zoo, of course). That big brown creature that roams Yellowstone National Park is an American Bison. These mammals certainly look similar to yaks and buffalos and, to some degree, cows. But they are their own species. In fact, the scientific name for a bison is bison bison bison! \n\nThe diet for a bison consists of only plants. Bison do not eat meat. Primarily, they eat mostly grasses, weeds, and leafy plants. They actually consume around 24 pounds of grass every day. They eat until they are full, then they rest. Then they eat again and rest again. They do this over and over for nine to eleven hours every day! \n\nAt one point in American history, there were tens of millions of bison roaming North America. Sadly, this massive population was reduced to only 500 animals, almost sealing their fate as extinct. The animals were hunted as a sport or killed for other reasons, even government-encouraged reasons. But President Theodore Roosevelt saved the day for the bison when he realized amazing the land out West was with the bison on it. He and a man named William Hornaday formed the American Bison Society. Because of their efforts, bison now live in all 50 states!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this unique beast!

      "description": "In this installment of the Financial Literacy series, your kids and students will learn about the difference between borrowing money or saving money to buy something. Financial Literacy\u2014Borrowing vs. Saving focuses on the pros and cons to each choice to help kids decide what they would do if they wanted to buy something.\n\nSaving money is something we do so that we can eventually buy something we want, like a new bike. This can take time. If you want something more immediately, you can borrow money. Borrowing money, however, means that you have to pay back the money you borrowed over time. And sometimes you have to pay interest. You can get a loan from someone, like a parent, and pay it back over time. \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these important skills!

In this video for kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about the many different arthropods that live around us. Of all the groups of animals, arthropods are the most diverse. There are over a million different species!\n\nInsects, arachnids, and crustaceans are the three largest groups of arthropods. Crustaceans, of course, live in water. Insects and spiders live on land. In fact, you can find arthropods in every habitat on earth! Some can easily live in really cold, frigid climates while others thrive in the heat of the hottest desert! Which ones live near you?\n\nMost arthropods are segmented into three sections: head, thorax, and abdomen. Arthropods also have a nervous system with a brain and nerves! They also have a circulatory system and a digestive system. Speaking of food, their diets vary widely depending on the species. \n\nSome eat plants, some eat animals, and some eat both. Usually, they have some form of appendage that helps them get food into their mouths. And there are others, such as some species of spiders, that have an appendage specifically for inserting venom into their prey.

      "description": "What do you know about life cycles? In Metamorphosis for Kids, you'll learn about the life cycle of most insects and amphibians. All living organisms go through a life cycle. Different living things have different life cycles. Some living things look exactly like the parent, other living things (like humans) look like the parent with different traits, and others look much different than the parent.\n\nThere are two types of metamorphosis\u2014complete and incomplete. Complete metamorphosis consists of four stages, and incomplete metamorphosis consists of just three stages. Incomplete metamorphosis is sometimes called gradual or simple. The word metamorphosis comes from the Greek words meta, which means \u201cchange\u201d, and morphe, meaning \u201cform.\" To sum it up, the word means \u201cchange of form.\u201d\n\nAbout 90% of all insects undergo complete metamorphosis, which involves 4 stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Some, like grasshoppers, undergo incomplete metamorphosis, which involves three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Amphibians like frogs, toads, and newts also experience a 3-stage incomplete metamorphosis: egg, larva, adult.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this interesting type of life cycle!

      "description": "Did you know that the polar bear is the world's largest four-legged predator? In Polar Bears for Kids, you'll discover lots of interesting facts like this. Adult male polar bears weigh around 1,000 pounds, and females weigh about 500 pounds. When they stand on their hind legs, these bears can be over 10 feet tall!\n\nThese massive bears roam around the Arctic, spending half of their time hunting for food. Polar bears primarily eat ringed and bearded seals because they need large amounts of fat to survive. They will rest silently outside a seal's breathing hold in the ice, waiting for it to surface. As soon as it does, the polar bear pounces and grabs its meal. While this seems like a foolproof plan, most polar bears only catch one to two seals out of every ten they hunt.\n\nPolar bears rely on sea ice for everything from hunting to traveling and resting to mating. Unfortunately, polar bears have difficulty adjusting to sea ice loss due to climate change. In fact, the loss of sea ice is the primary threat to polar bears all over the Arctic. As the climate warms, the sea ice melts earlier and forms later, so polar bears have less time to hunt.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful bears!

      "description": "What are the different types of clouds that we see in the sky? In this video for kids, you'll learn about 10 different types of clouds and what they mean. But first, what is a cloud? Clouds occur in the atmosphere. The atmosphere includes all of the gases that surround the planet, including the oxygen that we breathe! The atmosphere is also full of water. The water in the atmosphere is made of tiny drops that are too small for the human eye to see.\n\nClouds start forming when the liquid water droplets in our atmosphere transform into gaseous water vapor. When the water vapor rises it comes in contact with cooler, thinner air. As the warm air and water vapor cool, clouds are formed. All of that is a long way of saying that a cloud is a group of water vapor droplets or ice crystals hovering in the atmosphere.\n\nThe 10 types of clouds you'll learn about are cirrus, cirrocumulus, cirrostratus, altostratus, altocumulus, nimbostratus, stratus, stratocumulus, cumulus, and cumulonimbus clouds. They all mean something different. For instance, cumulonimbus clouds are those giant, dark clouds that bring lots of rain and can even cause thunderstorms and tornadoes.

      "description": "What is a nematode? This video for kids talks all about the animals of the Nematoda phylum. And to answer that question, they're small, slender worms. They can range from microscopic in size to almost three FEET! Gross! On average, though, they are about two inches long.\n\nIt is estimated that there could be as many as 500,000 types of nematodes in the world. And a portion of these are parasitic, meaning they feed off of other living organisms to survive. They have radial symmetry in their heads but bilateral symmetry on their bodies. They are generally cylindrical in shape too, and they have no organs. \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "Did you know that you can find frogs on every continent except Antarctica? In Frogs for Kids, you'll learn lots of cool facts. For instance, true frogs include the bullfrog, common frog, green frog, leopard frog, marsh frog, pickerel frog, and wood frog. They are called \"true frogs\" because of their body form and history. Part of their life cycle is spent in the water (aquatic), and part is spent on land (terrestrial). You may have seen the bullfrog or common frog in streams, ponds, or marshes near your home! Frogs can be shy, though. When you approach them, they leap for cover, preferably in water.\n\nPerhaps you have heard of or seen tree frogs! Tree frogs are fascinating. They have special adhesive pads and claws on their feet to help them climb. Though most are small, some species can grow nearly six inches long. Tree frogs come in various colors. Their bright coloring serves two purposes. One is to camouflage them from predators. The other, for some species, is to alert predators that the frog is poisonous. Similarly, dart frogs also have very vibrant coloring, and some species are poisonous as well. In fact, the poison dart frog produces enough toxins to be deadly to humans. It is considered one of Earth's most toxic, or poisonous, animals.\n\nThere are several reasons why frogs are essential to the environment. Frogs eat disease-carrying mosquitoes and are a vital food source for hundreds of animal species. Tadpoles feed on algae, which keeps streams and ponds clear. And frogs are known as bioindicators. Bioindicators are sources that indicate how healthy an ecosystem is. Remember that frogs absorb water through their skin; toxins such as pollution from factories come with the water. Scientists can measure how much of a toxin a frog absorbs and estimate how unhealthy the water is. Healthy frogs are one indicator of a healthy biosystem. Scientists also use frogs in medical research.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these amazing amphibians!

      "description": "What is an invention? It's something that has never been made before. Inventors are the ones who create inventions! This video for kids shares some cool insights about some common inventions and the famous inventors that made those things. Most inventions are made because people have an idea about something they need but don't already have.\n\nMany historians believe that things like the wheel, knife, and arrow were all created because there was a need for transportation, protection, and hunting respectively. The famous Thomas Edison created the incandescent lightbulb to improve on previous lightbulb designs and make something more affordable. He also invented the phonograph!\n\nLouis Pasteur made some significant breakthroughs in science. He created the process of pasteurization that kills germs and prevents spoilage in food items like milk. Pasteur also developed the vaccines for cholera, anthrax, small pox, and rabies. And the famous Toll House cookie was created by Ruth Graves Wakefield way back in 1938. Her recipe is the one that is still used today.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about some fun inventions and inventors!

      "description": "Did you know that sea sponges aren't plants but animals? This video for kids provides some interesting facts about the least advanced group of animals in the world. Sponges can live for up to 200 years. But did you know that when a piece of a sponge is broken off, it will grow to become a new sponge? This is fragmentation and is a form of asexual reproduction.\n\nSome porifera are carnivorous, meaning they only eat meat. And their favorite food is crab. That\u2019s probably because crabs are the easiest for them to catch. When a crab scuttles over a sponge, the sponge can detect the crab with its spicules. Spicules are Velcro-like structures that cause the crab\u2019s legs to stick to the sponge. Every cell in a sponge is independent. So even when it \u201ceats\u201d the crab, each cell works independently to digest the food.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "What is an earthworm? In this video for kids, you'll discover that earthworms are small, tube-shaped animals that live in the ground. They have long, soft bodies that are made up of many segments which look like little rings. Each segment has tiny bristles called setae that help the earthworm move through the soil. Their mouths are located at the front end, and they use them to eat dirt and organic matter, which helps them get nutrients.\n\nThese slimy creatures are detritivores, meaning they eat dead and decaying matter. They never need to catch their food like other animals since it's all around them in the soil. By constantly eating and moving through the soil, they help break down organic material and mix it into the ground, creating a healthy environment for plants to grow. This process is called vermicomposting and is often used in gardens to improve soil health.\n\nEarthworms are very important for the environment because they help keep the soil healthy. Their\ntunnels allow air and water to reach plant roots, which helps plants grow strong. Earthworms also eat\ndead leaves and other organic material, breaking it down into smaller pieces. This process turns the\nmaterial into nutrient-rich soil, which provides essential nutrients for plants. Without earthworms, the\nsoil would not be as fertile, and it would be harder for plants to grow.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these unique animals!

      "description": "Still need costume ideas for Halloween? How about a koala! Koalas are cute and cuddly little animals. They have soft, fluffy fur in colors that range from gray to brown, helping them blend in with the trees where they live. They have big round ears and a large, black nose to sniff out their favorite food: eucalyptus leaves. Their sharp claws and padded feet make them excellent climbers, too, allowing them to grip tree branches securely.\n\nKoalas are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. And as you remember, their favorite food is eucalyptus leaves. Eucalyptus leaves are tough and not very nutritious, but koalas have particular adaptations to help them digest this food. They spend most of their time eating eucalyptus leaves and resting in trees. Naturally, they are excellent climbers. They have two thumbs on each front paw to help them grip branches and climb trees more efficiently.\n\nBelieve it or not, koalas have fingerprints that are distinct to each individual. These fingerprints are not only found on their paws but also on their nose! This makes each koala's nose print unique, like our human fingerprints. Scientists can use the nose prints to identify and track individual koalas in the wild, helping with conservation efforts and population studies.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these adorable marsupials!

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how camels survive in the scorching desert? Well, they can survive because of some unique traits. Camels have long legs that help them walk across the desert sand easily. Their bodies store fat in humps, which they use as a source of energy when food and water are scarce. They also have thick fur to protect them from the hot sun and sand. Plus, they can close their nostrils to avoid getting sand in their noses during storms. Their long eyelashes and ear hairs also help keep sand out of their\u2014well, eyes and ears!\n\nCamels are herbivores, which means they eat plants instead of animals. But there aren't many plants in the desert, so camels must eat whatever they can find. They spend a lot of their time searching for plants to consume. When they find a good spot with enough food, they use their strong necks to reach high branches or bend down low to the ground. They munch on dry grasses, leaves, and even thorny plants that other animals might avoid. Camels have tough lips and strong teeth that help them chew these rough plants without getting hurt.\n\nCamels are not currently endangered, but they do face some challenges. Habitat loss and climate change can make it harder for them to find food and water. Some wild camel species, like the Bactrian camel in Asia, are endangered because only a few are left in the wild. People are working to protect these animals by creating reserves and breeding programs to ensure they don't disappear. By caring for camels and their habitats, we can help them continue to thrive and support the people and ecosystems that rely on them.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these majestic mammals!

      "description": "Did you know kangaroos could swim? In Kangaroos for Kids, you'll learn all about this magnificent mammal. The kangaroo is a unique animal known for its powerful hind legs and oversized feet, which help it hop quickly across the Australian landscape. Kangaroos are marsupials, which means they carry their young in pouches. They have a long, muscular tail that helps them balance while jumping. Depending on the species, they have short fur in different colors, like gray, brown, or red. Their large ears can rotate to pick up sounds from various directions, allowing them to stay alert for danger.\n\nKangaroos are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. They mainly feed on grasses, leaves, and shrubs. They cut and chew tough plants using their strong front incisors. Plus, they have a special stomach with multiple chambers that help them break down the fibrous plant material, similar to how cows digest their food. This multi-chambered stomach lets them get all the nutrients they need from their plant-based diet.\n\nDid you know kangaroos can swim, too? When they swim, their legs work differently than on land. In the water, they use their back legs separately, moving them in a paddle motion to help them glide forward. They use their tail to steer them in the water. So, kangaroo legs are perfectly adapted on land or water to help them get around!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these powerful marsupials!

      "description": "Did you know that you probably use magnets every day in one way or another? Magnets are everywhere, in doorbells and computers, in There are three kinds: temporary, permanent, and electromagnets. Temporary magnets become magnetized when a magnetic field is present. But they lose that magnetism once the magnetic field is gone.\n\nPermanent magnets are made from materials that are naturally or chemically magnetized, like iron or nickel. These are the magnets you would use on your fridge. Electromagnets are created by running an current through a coil with a metal core. The energized core creates magnetic field, and when the current turns off, the magnetic field disappears. An MRI machine is a great example of an electromagnet.\n\nThe earth itself is a magnet! It has a magnetic field that is generated by the earth's core. This is because of the molten iron and nickel that exists in the earth's outer core. The movement of the metals acts like an electric generator. Cool, huh?\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning about magnetism.

      "description": "Did you know that otters hold hands? This video for kids will teach you all kinds of fun tidbits of information about these cute creatures. Otters are adorable semi-aquatic mammals that live all around the world. They have long, slender bodies covered in thick, waterproof fur. Their fur keeps them warm and dry while swimming. Otters come in a range of colors depending on the species. Most otters have brown or dark-brown fur, which helps them blend in with their surroundings in rivers and forests. \n\nOtters are skilled hunters with a varied diet, including fish, crabs, frogs, and even small mammals like water-rats. They use their sharp claws and strong jaws to catch and eat food. When hunting, they dive into the water and use their excellent swimming skills to chase after their prey. They can hold their breath for several minutes while they search for food under water.\n\nUnfortunately, some otter populations are starting to disappear, which means they are endangered. This can happen because of pollution, habitat loss, and hunting. To help protect otters, people are working to keep their homes clean and safe and creating laws to protect these animals from harm.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these adorable semi-aquatic mammals!

      "description": "What's the difference, or differences, between gators and crocs? Alligators and crocodiles might look very similar, but their physical characteristics have some essential differences. Alligators have broader, U-shaped snouts, while crocs have narrower, V-shaped snouts. When their mouths are closed, you can see the teeth of a crocodile sticking out, but a gator's teeth are mostly hidden. Alligators usually have darker, more blackish-gray skin, and crocodiles tend to have lighter, olive-brown skin.\n\nGators and crocs have similar diets but hunt in slightly different ways. Both of these reptiles are carnivores, which means they eat meat. They enjoy eating fish, birds, and small mammals. Sometimes, they might even eat larger animals like deer. Alligators usually hunt by lurking in the water with just their eyes and nostrils above the surface. When a prey animal approaches, the alligator snaps its powerful jaws shut with lightning speed to catch it. Crocs hunt similarly, but because they can live in fresh and salt water, they also catch animals that come to drink at the edges of rivers and lakes.\n\nAlligators and crocodiles are ancient animals. They have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago! This makes them some of the oldest living animal species on Earth. They are part of a group of animals called archosaurs, which includes dinosaurs and birds. And these reptiles have hardly changed over millions of years, so they are like living fossils.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these ancient reptiles!

      "description": "Emus are among some of the few bird species that don't fly. They are fascinating birds that are really tall! They stand up to six feet (almost two meters) high, which makes them the second-tallest birds in the world after ostriches. Emus have long, strong legs that help them run fast, almost as fast as a car! Their feathers are usually brownish, and they have tiny wings they don't use for flying.\n\nThese big birds have very powerful legs. But they aren't just for walking\u2014they help emus run super fast. They can even reach speeds up to 30 miles per hour (about 50 kilometers per hour)! This makes them one of the fastest birds on land. Their legs are also strong enough to jump high, which comes in handy when they need to escape from predators.\n\nCurrently, emus are not endangered. In fact, they are pretty common in Australia. However, protecting their habitats and making sure they have enough food and space to live comfortably are still important. Conservation efforts focus on stabilizing their populations so that they thrive in the wild.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting birds!

It's a time when people worldwide come together to show their love and care for our planet, Earth. This day reminds us of how important it is to protect and take care of our environment. On Earth Day, everyone engages in environmental education and eco-friendly activities.\n\nEarth Day is important because it teaches us how we can make a positive impact on our planet. Learning about things like recycling, saving water, and reducing waste can help keep Earth healthy for many generations.

Earth is not just our home but also the home of millions of plants and animals that need our help.\n\nOn Earth Day, we can take action by learning more about the environment and how we can make a difference. Whether using less plastic, planting a garden, or learning about endangered animals, every small action makes a significant impact. It's about learning new ways to help our planet and sharing those ideas with others. Earth Day isn't just about one day of the year. We can learn from each other and share ideas to make our communities cleaner and greener places to live.

      "description": "What exactly is artificial intelligence? Did you know there are different levels? This video for kids discusses how people use AI and outlines some of the the pros and cons of using it. \n\nIf you have used Siri or Google Assistant, or asked a question to Alexa, then you are using a form of artificial intelligence. These all use voice recognition and machine learning to answer questions and respond to requests. If you have ever contacted customer service online to get help, then more than likely, your conversation began with a chatbot, a computer-designed program that simulates human conversation. Chatbots were not always considered AI because they could not learn or adapt. However, chatbots have recently become more sophisticated and are increasingly using the power of AI learning.\n\nThere are several beneficial uses for AI, and even more when you pair AI with robotics. For example, we are automating tasks that are unsafe for humans, like mixing toxic chemicals. Many of the products we use today incorporate some form of AI in making the products. But AI is expensive, it can be weaponized, and it can result in the loss of jobs for humans, among other things. While none of us can predict the future, AI is here. What we cannot do is overestimate the power of good or underestimate the potential for disaster. Do the pros outweigh the cons? You'll have to decide!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about artificial intelligence!

      "description": "What do you know about beavers? In this video for kids, you'll learn quite a bit that you might not know. Beavers are mammals that live in streams, rivers, and ponds across North America, Europe, and Asia. They have unique features that help them live in water. They are known for their flat tails that look like a canoe paddle. Their fur is waterproof, keeping them warm and dry even in cold water. Beavers also have webbed feet that help them swim fast and dive under water.\n\nWhen beavers want to collect food under water, they use their fantastic swimming skills and sharp teeth. They dive down, using their front paws to grab branches and pull them to the surface. Then, they use their teeth to cut the branches into smaller pieces that they can carry back to their lodge or store under water for later. This clever way of gathering food keeps them well-fed throughout the year, even when it's hard to find fresh plants in winter.\n\nBecause they create unique habitats that support various plants and animals, beavers are incredibly important for the environment. Their dams transform flowing streams into calm ponds and wetlands, providing homes and food for fish, frogs, birds, insects, and other creatures. Wetlands play a crucial role in water filtering and maintaining quality, benefiting wildlife and humans downstream. By altering their surroundings in these ways, beavers boost the biodiversity of the area and support healthy ecosystems.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting mammals!

In All about Canada for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about this cool neighbor of ours. For instance, Canada is the second-largest country in the world but is home to only about half of 1% of the world's total population! That's a lot of space for so few people.\n\nCanada is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Ottawa, Ontario, is the capitol city, and the largest city is Toronto, Ontario. The second-largest city in Canada is Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec. It's a major seaport and one of the biggest French-speaking countries in the world. After all, both English and French are the two official languages of the country. Nearly half the people in Canada have British ancestors, and around one-fourth have French ancestors. There is also a small group of First Nations people and Inuit who live there.\n\nLots of different animals lives among the mountains, plains, forests, and lakes of Canada. Some of these include bears, beavers, moose, mountain lions, bison, antelope, caribou, foxes, owls, and even polar bears! There are 41 national parks and 3 conservation areas throughout the country.

      "description": "Do you know what the ISS is? On November 2, 2000, one American (Bill Shepherd) and two Russians (Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev) began living on the International Space Station. They started preparing the ISS for others and stayed for four months to finish making it habitable.\n\nIn November of 1998, a Russian rocket launched and carried the first piece of the International Space Station into space. The piece was called the Zarya control module. Two weeks later, the Endeavor\u2014a United States space shuttle\u2014carried the Unity node component. The first two pieces were joined together, and the building of the International Space Station was underway.\n\nThe current plan is for the space station to operate until at least 2028. After 2028, the fate of the ISS is unclear. Many scientists would like to replace it or renovate it for future use. No matter what happens, the International Space Station has been, and will continue to be, beneficial to many people for many reasons. NASA will also use what they learn to one day explore other worlds, reaching farther into space than ever before. The space station information will help prepare for human missions in the future.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the ISS!

      "description": "What is the difference between a robotics engineer and a robotics technician? In Careers: Robotics for Kids, you'll learn a little about both career options.\n\nRobotics technicians use advanced tools and technologies to design, build, and maintain robots. A 3D printer and laser cutter are some of their most essential tools. Robotics technicians use them to carefully assemble electronic components and circuits. They also use special software to program robots and control their movements precisely. In today's fast-paced world, the demand for skilled robotics technicians is snowballing. Nearly every field, from manufacturing and healthcare to agriculture and space exploration, integrates robots into their work. As robots become more integrated into our daily lives, the opportunities for robotics technicians will only continue to grow.\n\nIf you love tinkering with gadgets and figuring out how things work, being a robotics engineer could be perfect for you! You could help make new robots that do all sorts of amazing things. Robots will make the world a better place. They will free humans from tedious tasks and allow them to do other creative activities. Robots are the future. As a robotics engineer, you could help create robots that help people with disabilities. For example, you might create a robot that allows people who can't walk to move around. Or you could build robots that clean up pollution. Maybe your interest is space. Robots are piloting spacecraft now. There are so many possibilities!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about careers in robotics!

      "description": "You probably know that ostriches are the biggest birds in the world and that they can't fly. But what else do you know about them? Ostriches for kids teaches you a lot more fun facts. Ostriches live in the savannas and deserts of Africa. These open spaces give them plenty of room to run and find food. Ostriches are social animals and often live in groups called flocks. These flocks can range in size from a few birds to over 50! Living in a group keeps them safe from predators because they can watch for danger together.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about ostriches is their incredible speed. They can sprint up to 45 miles per hour, making them the fastest birds on land! This astonishing speed helps them escape from predators, including lions and hyenas. And their strong legs can deliver powerful kicks that can fend off attackers. Ostriches only have two toes on each foot, though, which is a unique trait among birds.\n\nCurrently, ostriches are not considered endangered, but their populations in the wild face threats from habitat loss and human activities. Loss of habitat due to agriculture and urban development reduces the areas where ostriches can live and find food. Sometimes, they are hunted for their meat, feathers, and leather, which puts additional pressure on their populations. Conservation efforts are essential to protect ostriches and ensure they thrive in their natural environments for future generations to enjoy.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these ginormous birds!

      "description": "In this video for kids, you will learn how to properly use a subordinating conjunction. A conjunction is a word that connects words, phrases, or clauses. A subordinating conjunction specifically connects a dependent clause and an independent clause. In fact, the subordinating conjunction is part of the dependent clause.\n\nSubordinating conjunctions can also be used to introduce adverb clauses, which add further detail to an existing clause. These are words or phrases like after, before, as soon as, even if, so that, now that, etc.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these conjunctions!

      "description": "Did you know some plants eat animals? In Carnivorous Plants for Kids, you'll discover lots of unique facts about carnivorous plants. They are a unique group of plant species that eat insects, sometimes even small animals. These plants have interesting ways of catching their food. They live in places where the soil is poor in nutrients, so they have to find other ways to get the nutrients to grow and survive. By catching insects, they can get extra vitamins and minerals to develop properly.\n\nCarnivorous plants are found in different parts of the world. Some grow in swamps and bogs, where the soil is very wet and acidic. Others grow in tropical forests with high humidity. Each type of carnivorous plant has adapted to its environment in its own way. Their ability to eat animals helps them survive and thrive in their specific habitats.\n\nExamples include Venus flytraps, butterwort, sundew, and pitcher plants. They all catch their food in different ways, but they all have one thing in common: they need extra nutrients to grow. They live where the soil does not have enough food for them. That's why they catch and eat insects instead of relying on the soil. When they consume insects, they get the essential nutrients that their soil lacks. This unique method of obtaining nutrients helps them thrive in challenging conditions.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting plants!

      "description": "What do you know about the Middle East? In this kids video, you'll learn that the Middle East is a region of countries near the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea. There is some historical controversy over which countries are part of the region. Many geographers and historians agree that 17 countries compose the region. These countries are Bahrain, Cyprus, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, The United Arab Emirates, Turkey, and Yemen. Others also include additional parts of Africa and more northern countries like Kazakhstan, which they refer to as the greater Middle East.\n\nPopular culture often features the Middle East as a vast, arid desert. But that is a geographical misconception. While it is true that large portions of the Middle East are desert, the region contains a diverse set of topographical features. The area has fertile river valleys, mountainous parts, and coastal plains. Parts can even get snow.\n\nSome of the conflicts in the Middle East are the result of the wealth gap between neighboring countries. In recent years, technology and the improvement of transportation have bridged the gap to some degree. With several conflicts raging throughout the Middle East, however, there is great uncertainty about the region's future. Efforts to secure long-term peace in the area have been complex and elusive. However, the people of the Middle East are very resilient and primarily optimistic about the future of their homelands.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the Middle Eastern region!

      "description": "What do you know about magnets and electricity? This video describes some helpful facts about magnetism and electromagnets that you might not know. All magnets have two poles called the north pole and the south pole. If we place two magnets together and the poles are opposite (north and south), they will attract one another. On the other hand, two magnets together that have the same poles will repel each other.\n\nThe area around a magnet is called a magnetic field, and Earth has its own magnetic field. That means our planet is like a giant magnet. When we use a compass, the needle inside is a magnet with two poles. The north pole of the needle attracts to the north pole on Earth (as in the magnetic north pole, not the North Pole location). This is why the compass needle always points north.\n\nElectromagnets are the only magnets that require electricity to work. Once the source of electricity of an electromagnet is turned off or disconnected, the electromagnet will no longer work. Keep watching the video for some fun STEM activities that you could try at home. Make sure you have adults around to help you.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about magnetism and electricity.

      "description": "When you think of a wombat, what comes to mind? In Wombats for Kids, you'll learn that these are unique and fascinating animals. They have sturdy, compact bodies with strong legs and sharp claws, making them excellent diggers. Their fur is thick and coarse, ranging from gray to brown, which helps them blend into their surroundings. Wombats have small eyes and ears but a keen sense of smell, which they use to navigate and find food. They're marsupials, so the females have a pouch in which baby wombats develop.\n\nWombats are herbivores, so they eat plants, and their favorite food is grass. They use their excellent sense of smell to locate food, sniffing fresh vegetation to munch on. Wombats spend most of their time grazing and munching on grasses, roots, and other plants they find in their habitat. They use their sharp claws and strong teeth to dig up roots and tubers and break tough grasses and leaves apart. They are nocturnal animals, meaning they are most active at night. So, they do most of their feeding during the cooler hours of the evening and early morning.\n\nIf you knew anything about them before watching this video, it was probably that their poop is cubed. This unique shape allows the poop to stay in place so that it doesn't roll away, especially on uneven surfaces like rocks or logs, not that they would actually care about that... Scientists think that the cube shape occurs because wombats have long intestines and dry poop, which might make it come out in small, square pieces. So, if you ever come across cube-shaped poop in the wild, you'll know it probably came from a wombat!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting animals!

      "description": "Have you ever heard of the corpse flower? In Corpse Flower for Kids, you'll learn some smelly facts about the stinky plant. The corpse flower is a giant plant native to rainforests of Indonesia. It got this name because it releases a strong smell similar to rotting meat when it blooms! \n\nDespite its stinky odor, many people come to see it because it's one of the largest flowers in the world, growing up to 10 feet tall. The corpse flower has a large, purple-colored spadix (a spike-like structure) surrounded by a deep red or maroon-colored spathe (a petal-like structure). The unusual flower attracts insects like beetles and flies that help pollinate it. \n\nBeyond its notorious smell, the corpse flower has another intriguing characteristic\u2014its infrequent blooming schedule. It can take up to 7 to 10 years or more for a corpse flower to bloom again after its first bloom. The long dormancy, followed by a rare and brief blooming event, makes seeing a corpse flower in full bloom a memorable experience for botanists and plant enthusiasts.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this interesting plant!

Stink bugs are small insects with shield-shaped bodies in different colors\u2014brown, green, or gray. They have sucking mouth parts that they use to eat plant sap. Stink bugs can change their color slightly to blend in with their surroundings. This adaptation, known as cryptic coloration, helps them avoid being detected by predators.\n\nThese bugs also use their stinky smell as a defense mechanism. When they feel threatened, they release a strong, pungent odor from glands in their thorax. This smell helps protect them from predators like birds and lizards. You can find stink bugs in gardens, around farms, and even inside homes during the colder months. They like to feed on fruits, vegetables, and flowers.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting bugs!

      "description": "Ever heard of a bombardier beetle? Maybe you've seen one but didn't know what it was. This video for kids teaches you some unique facts about these smelly insect. The bombardier beetle is a small insect with a shiny black or dark-brown body, a red or dark-orange head, and a hard shell. Some species have green ridged wings, depending on their habitat. What makes it unique is that it can spray a hot, stinky liquid from the tip of its abdomen when it feels threatened. The liquid can reach temperatures close to boiling! And, of course, it smells awful.\n\nBombardier beetles have precise control over releasing their spray and can aim it accurately at their enemies. The smell helps scare away predators like birds or other insects that might want to eat them. These smelly bugs usually live on the ground in forests or fields where they can find food to eat, including small insects and plants.\n\nBombardier beetles also produce audible sounds as part of their defensive strategy. When threatened, some species of bombardier beetles can create noises by rapidly expelling air through their spiracles, which are tiny holes along their abdomen. This sound\u2014pop, click, pop\u2014is an additional deterrent to predators, signaling that the beetle is prepared to defend itself. Combined with their chemical spray, this auditory defense mechanism tells predators to stay far away.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this interesting insect!

      "description": "What is a veterinarian? In Careers: Veterinarian for Kids, you'll learn that veterinarians are animal doctors who care for pets, farm animals, zoo animals, and even wild animals. They help keep animals healthy and treat them when they're sick or hurt. Vets work in places like animal hospitals, zoos, and even government offices. Some also work in labs to study animal diseases, and others ensure food safety and animal welfare for the government. If you love animals and want to make a difference in their lives, becoming a veterinarian could be the perfect job.\n\nTo become a vet, you must undergo rigorous academic training and practical experience. After high school, veterinarians pursue a bachelor's degree in a science-related field such as biology, chemistry, or animal science. Following undergraduate studies, admission to a doctor of veterinary medicine (DVM) program requires four additional years of education. After that, veterinarians may pursue internships or residencies to gain specialized experience in fields like surgery, internal medicine, or veterinary research training.\n\nIf you love animals and want to spend your days making sure they're healthy, happy, and safe, becoming a veterinarian is a great way to do that. Whether working in a clinic, a zoo, or a research lab, being a vet is a fun and fulfilling career that allows you to make a real difference in the world.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about a career in veterinary medicine!

      "description": "What do you know about the dinosaurs that lived a looooong time ago? You've probably seen pictures of dinosaurs. Maybe you have watched a video or two about them. Have you visited a museum where their skeletons are? Dinosaurs are prehistoric reptiles. Prehistoric means before there was written history. The last dinosaurs lived millions of years ago. \n\nWhat remains of dinosaurs are fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals that lived a long time ago. These special rocks are how scientists know what life was like millions of years in the past. Clues from fossils and rocks tell scientists that dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic (mess-uh-zoh-ick) Era, when reptiles dominated the earth. The Mesozoic Era is known as the \"Age of Dinosaurs.\" It is divided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous. Dinosaurs became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period.\n\nScientists think there are two possible theories or reasons dinosaurs became extinct. Both theories suggest the sun was blotted by a catastrophic event. Without the warmth of the sun, the climate became very cold. What were the events that changed the climate? One may have been an asteroid that crashed into the earth. The dust covered the sun. The second is that thousands of volcanoes across the world erupted. They threw choking dust and pollution into the air. Either way, the warm sun disappeared. The world's climate became very cold. Dinosaurs became extinct because they could not survive the freezing weather or their habitat was polluted.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these extinct animals!

      "description": "Did you know some plants eat animals? In Carnivorous Plants for Kids, you'll discover lots of unique facts about carnivorous plants. They are a unique group of plant species that eat insects, sometimes even small animals. These plants have interesting ways of catching their food. They live in places where the soil is poor in nutrients, so they have to find other ways to get the nutrients to grow and survive. By catching insects, they can get extra vitamins and minerals to develop properly.\n\nCarnivorous plants are found in different parts of the world. Some grow in swamps and bogs, where the soil is very wet and acidic. Others grow in tropical forests with high humidity. Each type of carnivorous plant has adapted to its environment in its own way. Their ability to eat animals helps them survive and thrive in their specific habitats.\n\nExamples include Venus flytraps, butterwort, sundew, and pitcher plants. They all catch their food in different ways, but they all have one thing in common: they need extra nutrients to grow. They live where the soil does not have enough food for them. That's why they catch and eat insects instead of relying on the soil. When they consume insects, they get the essential nutrients that their soil lacks. This unique method of obtaining nutrients helps them thrive in challenging conditions.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting plants!

      "description": "What is an invention? It's something that has never been made before. Inventors are the ones who create inventions! This video for kids shares some cool insights about some common inventions and the famous inventors that made those things. Most inventions are made because people have an idea about something they need but don't already have.\n\nMany historians believe that things like the wheel, knife, and arrow were all created because there was a need for transportation, protection, and hunting respectively. The famous Thomas Edison created the incandescent lightbulb to improve on previous lightbulb designs and make something more affordable. He also invented the phonograph!\n\nLouis Pasteur made some significant breakthroughs in science. He created the process of pasteurization that kills germs and prevents spoilage in food items like milk. Pasteur also developed the vaccines for cholera, anthrax, small pox, and rabies. And the famous Toll House cookie was created by Ruth Graves Wakefield way back in 1938. Her recipe is the one that is still used today.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about some fun inventions and inventors!

      "description": "Have you ever heard of the water cycle? Maybe you've heard the word evaporation or precipitation. These are stages in the water cycle! In The Water Cycle for Kids, you will learn all four stages of this process, and you may even discover that you've seen it in action many times! You will also learn about how important it is to conserve freshwater on the earth.\n\nThe water you drink may possibly be millions of years old! This is because the earth has a certain amount of water that moves around the earth in different states and phases. The first stage is evaporation. This occurs when the sun heats the water in oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water to point that it turns into gas, and that gas evaporates into the air. Transpiration is similar to evaporation and occurs when plant leaves release water as water vapor into the air.\n\nCondensation is the third step. This is when the vapor in the air gets cold and changes back into a liquid. This is actually how a cloud forms! This is also the reason you see foggy mirrors after a hot shower. When clouds have too much water and get too heavy, it rains. When it rains, this is called precipitation, the final stage of the cycle. Then the whole cycle starts all over again! \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the water cycle!

      "description": "Did you know pandas have interesting sleeping habits? Pandas for Kids teaches you lots of cool facts about these fun bears. Unlike some animals with specific sleeping times, pandas take naps throughout the day and night. They sleep about two to four hours and then wake up to eat more bamboo. This napping schedule helps them conserve energy and maintain their strength. Digesting bamboo requires a lot of energy. Pandas are excellent climbers, so they often find a comfortable resting spot in the trees to sleep. Plus, they can stay safe from predators.\n\nPandas live in the dense bamboo forests of China. The forests provide the perfect environment for the bears, offering plenty of bamboo to eat and trees to climb. Pandas are usually solitary animals, meaning they prefer to live alone rather than in groups. Each one has its own territory, which it marks with scent to keep other pandas away. However, they do come together during the mating season in the spring.\n\nRight now, pandas are considered vulnerable and are no longer endangered. However, there are still only around 1,800 left in the wild. They face threats like habitat loss due to deforestation and climate change, which makes it hard to find enough bamboo to eat. To help protect them, many organizations work hard to save their habitats and create nature reserves where pandas can live safely. Breeding programs in zoos also help increase the panda population. By protecting them, we also protect their entire ecosystem, which benefits many other plants and animals.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these iconic bears!

      "description": "Do you know what electricians do on a day-to-day basis? This video for kids explains the career of an electrician. The demand for electricians will be around for as long as electricity is produced! So far, there is nothing on the horizon that will replace electricity. Being an electrician is a safe choice for long-term employment. Most electricians work full time, and their projects might require that they work indoors or outdoors. They often have to work during storms and inclement weather if they specialize in power lines. If you like variety and working both indoors and outdoors, being an electrician might be a good career choice for you.\n\nThe minimum requirement for an electrician is a high school degree. However, many have two or four years at a technical school or college. The more education you have, the more in demand you will be. And you already learned why being in demand is important! In addition to education, electricians learn their trade in a multi-year apprenticeship or on-the-job training program. They learn electrical theory, blueprint reading, mathematics, electrical code requirements, and safety and first-aid practices.\n\nElectricians are essential to our modern society. They make repairs during storms, install electrical lines in new construction, and ensure your house's electricity is safe. A career as an electrician is gratifying. You get to provide people with a necessary service while working in a field you enjoy. That's why you should consider a career as an electrician!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about a career as an electrician!

      "description": "What do you know about the skunk that isn't related to its stinky spray? Skunks for Kids talks all about these furry black and white creatures. They are small mammals with an iconic color pattern. Most have black fur with white stripes or spots running down their backs and tails. But they can also be brown, gray, cream, or ginger. Skunks have small heads with pointed noses and round ears. Their most famous feature is their ability to spray a strong-smelling liquid from glands near their tails, when they feel threatened. This smelly spray helps them defend themselves against predators and other threats.\n\nSkunks have a varied diet and are considered omnivores, which means they eat plants and animals. Their diet includes insects, small mammals, birds, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. And their sharp claws and strong legs help them dig up grubs and worms from the soil. Skunks are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will eat whatever food is available in their habitat. They may also scavenge for food and feed on carrion, the leftover scraps from other animals' meals.\n\nThese fascinating animals play a vital role in the environment by helping control insect populations. They hunt and feed insects like beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. By consuming these pests, skunks help keep insect populations in check, which benefits plants, crops, and other animals. Additionally, skunks are scavengers and eat carrion, which helps clean up dead animals and organic matter from their habitat. This scavenging behavior contributes to nutrient cycling and helps maintain the balance of ecosystems.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these iconic bears!

      "description": "Why does lightning and thunder happen? Did you know thunder is the sound of lightning? In this video for kids, you'll learn about the science behind how and why lightning occurs. When lightning strikes, it's incredibly bright. The bright flash is caused by the rapid heating of the air around the lightning bolt. The air gets so hot that it expands quickly, making the loud noise we hear as thunder. Thunder is the sound of the air rushing back to its normal state after being heated. This is why thunder can rumble and roll for a long time.\n\nLightning actually plays a vital role in nature. It helps produce nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere. Plants need nitrogen to grow; lightning helps make this nitrogen available in the soil. So, in a way, lightning helps plants grow and keeps the environment healthy!\n\nScientists use special tools to study lightning. One tool is called a lightning detector. It can sense when lightning strikes and where it happens. This helps meteorologists, the scientists who study weather, predict storms and keep people safe. Lightning detectors are often used in weather stations to monitor storms and provide warnings.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this flashy phenomenon!

      "description": "Have you ever been to the country just north of the United States of America? In All about Canada for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about this cool neighbor of ours. For instance, Canada is the second-largest country in the world but is home to only about half of 1% of the world's total population! That's a lot of space for so few people.\n\nCanada is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Ottawa, Ontario, is the capitol city, and the largest city is Toronto, Ontario. The second-largest city in Canada is Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec. It's a major seaport and one of the biggest French-speaking countries in the world. After all, both English and French are the two official languages of the country. Nearly half the people in Canada have British ancestors, and around one-fourth have French ancestors. There is also a small group of First Nations people and Inuit who live there.\n\nLots of different animals lives among the mountains, plains, forests, and lakes of Canada. Some of these include bears, beavers, moose, mountain lions, bison, antelope, caribou, foxes, owls, and even polar bears! There are 41 national parks and 3 conservation areas throughout the country. One of the most famous national parks in Canada is Banff National Park.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the country of Canada!

      "description": "What do you know about beavers? In this video for kids, you'll learn quite a bit that you might not know. Beavers are mammals that live in streams, rivers, and ponds across North America, Europe, and Asia. They have unique features that help them live in water. They are known for their flat tails that look like a canoe paddle. Their fur is waterproof, keeping them warm and dry even in cold water. Beavers also have webbed feet that help them swim fast and dive under water.\n\nWhen beavers want to collect food under water, they use their fantastic swimming skills and sharp teeth. They dive down, using their front paws to grab branches and pull them to the surface. Then, they use their teeth to cut the branches into smaller pieces that they can carry back to their lodge or store under water for later. This clever way of gathering food keeps them well-fed throughout the year, even when it's hard to find fresh plants in winter.\n\nBecause they create unique habitats that support various plants and animals, beavers are incredibly important for the environment. Their dams transform flowing streams into calm ponds and wetlands, providing homes and food for fish, frogs, birds, insects, and other creatures. Wetlands play a crucial role in water filtering and maintaining quality, benefiting wildlife and humans downstream. By altering their surroundings in these ways, beavers boost the biodiversity of the area and support healthy ecosystems.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting mammals!

On November 2, 2000, one American (Bill Shepherd) and two Russians (Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev) began living on the International Space Station. They started preparing the ISS for others and stayed for four months to finish making it habitable.\n\nIn November of 1998, a Russian rocket launched and carried the first piece of the International Space Station into space. The piece was called the Zarya control module. Two weeks later, the Endeavor\u2014a United States space shuttle\u2014carried the Unity node component. The first two pieces were joined together, and the building of the International Space Station was underway.\n\nThe current plan is for the space station to operate until at least 2028. After 2028, the fate of the ISS is unclear. Many scientists would like to replace it or renovate it for future use. No matter what happens, the International Space Station has been, and will continue to be, beneficial to many people for many reasons. NASA will also use what they learn to one day explore other worlds, reaching farther into space than ever before. The space station information will help prepare for human missions in the future.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the ISS!

      "description": "What's the difference, or differences, between gators and crocs? Alligators and crocodiles might look very similar, but their physical characteristics have some essential differences. Alligators have broader, U-shaped snouts, while crocs have narrower, V-shaped snouts. When their mouths are closed, you can see the teeth of a crocodile sticking out, but a gator's teeth are mostly hidden. Alligators usually have darker, more blackish-gray skin, and crocodiles tend to have lighter, olive-brown skin.\n\nGators and crocs have similar diets but hunt in slightly different ways. Both of these reptiles are carnivores, which means they eat meat. They enjoy eating fish, birds, and small mammals. Sometimes, they might even eat larger animals like deer. Alligators usually hunt by lurking in the water with just their eyes and nostrils above the surface. When a prey animal approaches, the alligator snaps its powerful jaws shut with lightning speed to catch it. Crocs hunt similarly, but because they can live in fresh and salt water, they also catch animals that come to drink at the edges of rivers and lakes.\n\nAlligators and crocodiles are ancient animals. They have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago! This makes them some of the oldest living animal species on Earth. They are part of a group of animals called archosaurs, which includes dinosaurs and birds. And these reptiles have hardly changed over millions of years, so they are like living fossils.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these ancient reptiles!

It's a time when people worldwide come together to show their love and care for our planet, Earth. This day reminds us of how important it is to protect and take care of our environment. On Earth Day, everyone engages in environmental education and eco-friendly activities.\n\nEarth Day is important because it teaches us how we can make a positive impact on our planet. Learning about things like recycling, saving water, and reducing waste can help keep Earth healthy for many generations. It's like a birthday for Earth, reminding us to take care of the place we call home. Earth is not just our home but also the home of millions of plants and animals that need our help.\n\nOn Earth Day, we can take action by learning more about the environment and how we can make a difference. Whether using less plastic, planting a garden, or learning about endangered animals, every small action makes a significant impact. It's about learning new ways to help our planet and sharing those ideas with others. Earth Day isn't just about one day of the year. We can learn from each other and share ideas to make our communities cleaner and greener places to live. It's a chance to unite as a global community and work toward a healthier planet for everyone.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about Earth Day and how to celebrate!

      "description": "What is an earthworm? In this video for kids, you'll discover that earthworms are small, tube-shaped animals that live in the ground. They have long, soft bodies that are made up of many segments which look like little rings. Each segment has tiny bristles called setae that help the earthworm move through the soil. Their mouths are located at the front end, and they use them to eat dirt and organic matter, which helps them get nutrients.\n\nThese slimy creatures are detritivores, meaning they eat dead and decaying matter. They never need to catch their food like other animals since it's all around them in the soil. By constantly eating and moving through the soil, they help break down organic material and mix it into the ground, creating a healthy environment for plants to grow. This process is called vermicomposting and is often used in gardens to improve soil health.\n\nEarthworms are very important for the environment because they help keep the soil healthy. Their\ntunnels allow air and water to reach plant roots, which helps plants grow strong. Earthworms also eat\ndead leaves and other organic material, breaking it down into smaller pieces. This process turns the\nmaterial into nutrient-rich soil, which provides essential nutrients for plants. Without earthworms, the\nsoil would not be as fertile, and it would be harder for plants to grow.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these unique animals!

      "description": "Emus are among some of the few bird species that don't fly. They are fascinating birds that are really tall! They stand up to six feet (almost two meters) high, which makes them the second-tallest birds in the world after ostriches. Emus have long, strong legs that help them run fast, almost as fast as a car! Their feathers are usually brownish, and they have tiny wings they don't use for flying.\n\nThese big birds have very powerful legs. But they aren't just for walking\u2014they help emus run super fast. They can even reach speeds up to 30 miles per hour (about 50 kilometers per hour)! This makes them one of the fastest birds on land. Their legs are also strong enough to jump high, which comes in handy when they need to escape from predators.\n\nCurrently, emus are not endangered. In fact, they are pretty common in Australia. However, protecting their habitats and making sure they have enough food and space to live comfortably are still important. Conservation efforts focus on stabilizing their populations so that they thrive in the wild.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting birds!

      "description": "Have you ever heard of a frogmouth bird? This kids video will teach you some really fun facts about this unique bird. Frogmouth birds are fascinating creatures with unique physical characteristics. They have large, wide beaks that look like a frog's mouth, which is how they got their name. Since they are nocturnal, they hunt at night when many of their prey are active. They rely on their excellent night vision and sharp hearing to find food in the dark. Their large, wide beaks are perfect for catching their prey quickly.\n\nOne of the coolest facts about frogmouths is that they are masters of camouflage. Their feather patterns blend so well with tree bark that they are almost invisible when sitting still. During the day, they perch on branches and remain motionless, using their camouflage to hide from predators like owls and hawks. If a predator gets too close, a frogmouth will freeze in place, stretching its body to look like a branch, to fool its enemies.\n\nFrogmouths are not considered endangered, but some species, like the Papuan frogmouth, face habitat loss. As forests are cut down for farming or building, these birds lose their homes and places to hunt. While many frogmouth species are still doing well in the wild, it's critical to protect their habitats to make sure they can survive in the future. Conservation efforts that protect forests and woodlands can help keep frogmouths and other wildlife safe.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these unique birds!

      "description": "Did you know Chicago dyes the Chicago River green every year for St. Patrick's Day? This video for kids will introduce you to a lot of facts you might not know about this fun holiday. The history of Saint Patrick's Day dates back to the 5th century. A man named Patrick was born in Roman England. At age 16, he was kidnapped and taken to Ireland as a slave. After his escape, Patrick later returned to Ireland as a missionary. He played a crucial role in converting the Irish people to Christianity. March 17 is believed to be the date of his death, so it has been marked in his honor ever since.\n\nToday, Saint Patrick's Day has evolved into a major public festival celebrated globally. Large parades in cities like Dublin, New York, Chicago, and Boston fill the streets with floats, music, dancers, and performers. In addition to parades, there are activities, parties, concerts, and other events celebrating Irish culture. A unique part of the Saint Patrick's Day celebration is the \"wearing of the green.\" This tradition is tied to Ireland's nickname, the Emerald Isle, and the green in the Irish flag.\n\nSaint Patrick's Day is a festival that has grown from its religious roots into a global celebration of Irish culture. Whether it's attending a parade, wearing green, or enjoying Irish food, people worldwide come together every March 17 to celebrate the legacy of Patrick and the rich traditions of Ireland. It is a day full of fun, history, and pride for people of Irish descent and those who simply love Irish culture.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about how this fun holiday started If you want even more information on other holidays, head over to our website and download one of our many free lesson plans, full of activities, worksheets, and more! \n\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/holidays-saint-patricks-day/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/history-of-valentines-day/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/what-is-christmas/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/what-is-ramadan/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/what-is-kwanzaa/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/what-is-easter/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/thanksgiving-origins/\nhttps://learnbright.org/lessons/social-studies/history-of-halloween/\n\nThank you for watching and learning with us!

In this video for kids, you'll discover fun facts about the animals that belong to this phylum, including jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones.\n\nCnidaria is a phylum that contains more than 10,000 species that live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. There are five classes of cnidarians, and jellyfish are found in four of them! What makes these animals unique is specialized cells called cnidocytes, which they use for capturing prey. They're basically stinging cells.\n\nCnidarians don't have any respiratory organs, but they absorb oxygen from the water and expel carbon dioxide. They also have no central nervous system, like a brain. But they do have a collection of neural tissue that could possibly be a processing center. These unique animals also have the ability to regenerate! So if they lose a certain part, it can grow back!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "What do you know about life cycles? In Metamorphosis for Kids, you'll learn about the life cycle of most insects and amphibians. All living organisms go through a life cycle. Different living things have different life cycles. Some living things look exactly like the parent, other living things (like humans) look like the parent with different traits, and others look much different than the parent.\n\nThere are two types of metamorphosis\u2014complete and incomplete. Complete metamorphosis consists of four stages, and incomplete metamorphosis consists of just three stages. Incomplete metamorphosis is sometimes called gradual or simple. The word metamorphosis comes from the Greek words meta, which means \u201cchange\u201d, and morphe, meaning \u201cform.\" To sum it up, the word means \u201cchange of form.\u201d\n\nAbout 90% of all insects undergo complete metamorphosis, which involves 4 stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Some, like grasshoppers, undergo incomplete metamorphosis, which involves three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Amphibians like frogs, toads, and newts also experience a 3-stage incomplete metamorphosis: egg, larva, adult.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this interesting type of life cycle!

      "description": "Did you know you are a chordate? In this kids video, you'll learn a lot of interesting facts about chordates. All chordates are grouped into the phylum because, at some point in their life, they have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits (gills near the pharynx), and a muscular tail. The tail could remain into adulthood or disappear during embryonic development. They also all have a closed circulatory system with blood that flows through vessels and a heart with ventricles.\n\nScientists think the very first vertebrates evolved around 525 million years ago, but they can\u2019t determine if it was Myllokunmingia or Pikaia gracilens. Try to say those words really fast! So while it feels like most of our planet is covered in vertebrates, only about 5% of all animal species are vertebrates.\n\nAll vertebrates have a backbone, an endoskeleton, two pairs of appendages, a skull, and a bilateral symmetry. And the animals in this phylum include mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, birds, and amphibians. Keep in mind that all vertebrates are chordates, but not all chordates are vertebrates!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "Did you know chimpanzees are similar to humans when it comes to caring for their young ones? It's true! In this video for kids, you'll learn that chimpanzees are excellent parents! Baby chimpanzees stay close to their moms and hold on to their fur when they need a ride. Moms make cozy nests for them to sleep in at night. Like human babies and children, chimps learn essential things from their parents, like how to find food and be safe in the jungle.\n\nDespite what people used to think, chimps are omnivores and eat both meat and plant foods. Because of their keen senses, they are excellent foragers and can easily locate delicious treats in the forest. Their eyesight is excellent for spotting fruits and other food high in the trees. They also have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out ripe fruits or fresh plants to eat. And when they're in the mood for some protein, like insects or small animals, their quick thinking and use of tools come in handy.\n\nThese amazing primates are also known for their impressive tool-making skills. Chimps can create tools from objects they find in the environment to help them get food or solve problems. For instance, they might use leaves as sponges to soak up water and drink from them. This kind of tool use sets them apart from many other animals and shows their ability to innovate.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these precious primates!

      "description": "Did you know adult hippos can hold their breath for five minutes under water? Or that they produce their own sunscreen to shield them from the hot sun? In Hippos for Kids, you will learn lots more fun facts about these large mammals. For instance, they are fast! They may look big and bulky, but these animals can run surprisingly fast.\n\nHippos like to live in groups called pods. These pods can have anywhere from a few hippos to over 100! Living in a group helps them stay safe from predators like lions and crocodiles. They can hold their breath for a long time, so they spend a lot of time in the water. Hippos are also known for being noisy animals. They make loud grunts and roars to communicate with each other.\n\nHippopotamuses might seem like big, water-loving animals that splash around and don't do much else, but they're essential for our environment. They are known as ecosystem engineers. This is because they create unique habitats in the rivers and lakes where they live. It might sound a bit yucky, but when hippos poop in the water, the nutrients in the poop help plants grow. These plants provide food and shelter for many other animals, like fish and birds. Hippopotamuses truly help make their homes a better place for all living creatures in the habitat.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these hungry herbivores!

      "description": "Still need costume ideas for Halloween? How about a koala! Koalas are cute and cuddly little animals. They have soft, fluffy fur in colors that range from gray to brown, helping them blend in with the trees where they live. They have big round ears and a large, black nose to sniff out their favorite food: eucalyptus leaves. Their sharp claws and padded feet make them excellent climbers, too, allowing them to grip tree branches securely.\n\nKoalas are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. And as you remember, their favorite food is eucalyptus leaves. Eucalyptus leaves are tough and not very nutritious, but koalas have particular adaptations to help them digest this food. They spend most of their time eating eucalyptus leaves and resting in trees. Naturally, they are excellent climbers. They have two thumbs on each front paw to help them grip branches and climb trees more efficiently.\n\nBelieve it or not, koalas have fingerprints that are distinct to each individual. These fingerprints are not only found on their paws but also on their nose! This makes each koala's nose print unique, like our human fingerprints. Scientists can use the nose prints to identify and track individual koalas in the wild, helping with conservation efforts and population studies.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these adorable marsupials!

      "description": "Did you know that you probably use magnets every day in one way or another? Magnets are everywhere, in doorbells and computers, in There are three kinds: temporary, permanent, and electromagnets. Temporary magnets become magnetized when a magnetic field is present. But they lose that magnetism once the magnetic field is gone.\n\nPermanent magnets are made from materials that are naturally or chemically magnetized, like iron or nickel. These are the magnets you would use on your fridge. Electromagnets are created by running an current through a coil with a metal core. The energized core creates magnetic field, and when the current turns off, the magnetic field disappears. An MRI machine is a great example of an electromagnet.\n\nThe earth itself is a magnet! It has a magnetic field that is generated by the earth's core. This is because of the molten iron and nickel that exists in the earth's outer core. The movement of the metals acts like an electric generator. Cool, huh?\n\nWe hope you enjoyed learning about magnetism.

      "description": "What exactly is artificial intelligence? Did you know there are different levels? This video for kids discusses how people use AI and outlines some of the the pros and cons of using it. \n\nIf you have used Siri or Google Assistant, or asked a question to Alexa, then you are using a form of artificial intelligence. These all use voice recognition and machine learning to answer questions and respond to requests. If you have ever contacted customer service online to get help, then more than likely, your conversation began with a chatbot, a computer-designed program that simulates human conversation. Chatbots were not always considered AI because they could not learn or adapt. However, chatbots have recently become more sophisticated and are increasingly using the power of AI learning.\n\nThere are several beneficial uses for AI, and even more when you pair AI with robotics. For example, we are automating tasks that are unsafe for humans, like mixing toxic chemicals. Many of the products we use today incorporate some form of AI in making the products. But AI is expensive, it can be weaponized, and it can result in the loss of jobs for humans, among other things. While none of us can predict the future, AI is here. What we cannot do is overestimate the power of good or underestimate the potential for disaster. Do the pros outweigh the cons? You'll have to decide!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about artificial intelligence!

      "description": "Did you know that parrots are excellent parents? Did you know they can hold stuff with their feet? In Parrots for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about parrots. It's a pretty well-known fact that these birds are very beautiful with their vibrant feathers of all colors! They're social birds too, so they like to live in flocks.\n\nYou might wonder why parrots can mimic sounds they hear. This is actually because of an extraordinary part in their brain called the song system. It allows them to learn and replicate sounds they hear in their environment. The skill is a way for parrots to communicate with each other and even bond within their flocks. They can use different sounds to express their emotions and intentions.\n\nSome species, like the Spix's macaw (or blue macaw), are very rare and critically endangered. This is due to several factors, such as habitat loss or the illegal pet trade. Not all species are in trouble, but for those that are, we need to do what we can to provide extra protection for their survival.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful birds!

      "description": "If you had to guess whether rhinoceroses were carnivores, omnivores, or herbivores, what would you say? Rhinos for Kids will teach you that the answer is herbivores! They have a plant-based diet that consists of grass, leaves, branches, and fruits. Scientists consider the rhino both a browser and a grazer. Grazing refers to when rhinos nibble on grass and other plants on the ground. But they also browse, which means they use their strong lips and teeth to pluck leaves and branches from trees and bushes. You could think of them like the giant lawnmowers of the savanna.\n\nWhen caring for their little ones, rhino moms are very protective. They use their muscular bodies to keep their babies safe from danger. Baby rhinos, called calves, stay close to their moms. While in their mother's care, they learn how to find food and stay safe in the wild. It's like going to school with their mom as their teacher!\n\nSadly, many species of rhinoceros are endangered today and at risk of disappearing from the wild forever. This is mainly because of poaching. Poaching (or illegal hunting) has caused a severe decline in rhino populations. Some people hunt them because they believe that rhino horns have unique, almost magical properties, even though no scientific proof of this exists. Conservationists and scientists are working very hard to protect these amazing animals and their habitats to ensure that they continue to positively impact the environment\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these marvelous mammals!

      "description": "Ever heard of the food chain? In nature, all living things are connected through something called the food chain. The food chain shows how energy moves from one organism to another. Every living thing needs energy to survive, and that energy comes from food. The food chain helps us understand who eats whom in the wild, and it also shows how energy flows from one level to the next.\n\nAt the bottom of the food chain are the producers. Producers are usually plants and other organisms that make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Next in the food chain are the primary consumers. These are animals that eat plants, also known as herbivores. After the primary consumers come the secondary consumers. These are animals that eat herbivores. They are usually carnivores (meat-eaters) like foxes, snakes, and birds of prey.\n\nAt the top of the food chain are the tertiary consumers. These animals are often the largest and strongest predators, such as lions, wolves, and eagles. Tertiary consumers eat other carnivores and sometimes herbivores too. Because some have no natural predators, they are often called apex predators. Apex predators help keep ecosystems healthy by preventing any one species from becoming too dominant. Some apex predators eat tertiary consumers, making them quaternary consumers!\n\nWhen animals die, their bodies don't go to waste. Decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and earthworms break down dead plants and animals into tiny pieces. These decomposers return nutrients to the soil, which helps plants grow and start the food chain all over again. Decomposers are essential because they recycle nutrients and ensure that the ecosystem continues to function.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the food chain!

      "description": "What do you know about these hooded reptiles? In this video for kids, you'll learn why cobras have hoods and a lot more. Cobras are truly remarkable snakes with distinct physical features. They have long, slender bodies covered in smooth scales in various colors, including green, brown, and black. Their hoods, which they can puff up to appear larger and scarier when they feel threatened, set them apart from other snakes. These hoods are like their own special shields, and they use them to warn potential predators to stay away.\n\nCobras are carnivorous, and their favorite snacks include small animals like birds, rodents (such as mice and rats), and even other snakes! Cobras have long, sharp teeth called fangs that are hollow like tiny straws. When a cobra bites its prey, the venom flows from the fangs into the prey's body. This venom contains proteins and chemicals that can quickly paralyze or even kill the prey, making it easier for the cobra to have its meal.\n\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the hoods! Cobras have a fascinating ability to create unique \"music\" with their hoods, which is a form of communication. Their hoods are like musical instruments, and cobras can make rhythmic movements with them to send signals. When a cobra feels threatened or wants to warn other animals to stay away, it can open its hood. The display shows off the cobra's size and can make it look more intimidating.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these slick snakes!

      "description": "Do you know why killer bees are called killer bees? This video will enlighten your kids about the diet, behaviors, and habitat of the Africanized honey bee. That's right! Killer bees are also known as Africanized honey bees. This is because the ancestors from which they get their aggression are from Africa. (African honey bees are an especially hostile species.)\n\nAfricanized honey bees, though, actually have a mix of both African and European bee genes. They are known for their adaptability to hot climates and their ability to thrive in different environments. Those traits make them attractive to scientists who want to study how animals adapt to new homes.\n\nScientists gave these insects the nickname \"killer\" bees because of their aggressive behavior when it comes to defending their nests. And because killer bees have killed some humans! They are famous for being fast fliers and quick to protect their nests. When threatened, they form a swarm and chase away the intruders. Scientists call this behavior aggressive defense. It's like having a neighborhood watch that's always on high alert! When they swarm, their buzzing can be quite loud, which is their way of warning others to stay away.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting insects!

      "description": "Did you know dragons really do exist!? Well, maybe not the flying, fire-breathing kind. In Komodo Dragons for Kids, you'll learn all about these interesting reptiles and why they are considered an apex predator. These dragons live only in Southeastern Indonesia on a collection of islands. They use strong, sharp claws and teeth to catch their food. They also possess a unique gland in their lower jaw that secretes venom that immobilizes their prey. Their long, forked tongue helps them gather chemical information from the air, allowing them to locate potential food sources.\n\nKomodo dragons are really good at sneaking up on their prey. They have a particular skill called ambush predation. It's like a surprise attack! They hide in tall grass or behind rocks, and when an animal comes by, they use their strong legs and sharp claws to pounce on it. Crazy enough, Komodo dragons have a secret weapon\u2014their saliva! Their spit is full of harmful bacteria that can make an animal sick. So, even if the prey they are after gets away, it might not survive for long.\n\nAs for whether Komodo dragons are endangered, the answer is a bit complicated. They are not endangered overall, but their situation is tricky. You see, people sometimes hunt the dragons, and their homes are getting smaller because of things like deforestation. This makes it harder for them to find food and safe places to live. So, even though they are not endangered everywhere, some groups of Komodo dragons are at risk. We need to protect their habitats and make sure they have enough food to keep being the fantastic nature helpers they are!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these regal reptiles!

      "description": "Did you know that the largest squid have the biggest eyes of any animal in the animal kingdom? It's true! Their eyes can be as large as basketballs. In Squid for Kids, you'll learn a lot more about these rocket-like creatures of the sea, including the fact that, like other ocean animals, they can glow in the dark because of their ability of bioluminescence.\n\nSquid are like the race cars of the ocean because they have a unique way of swimming: jet propulsion. They have a body part called a siphon that helps them shoot water out with great force. By doing this, they can zoom through the water at impressive speeds. Think of it like a squid's rocket engine! This ability helps them catch prey and escape from predators in the blink of an eye. As an added superpower bonus, they can shoot a dark cloud of ink in their predators' faces and jet away.\n\nNaturally, squid are part of the ocean's food chain. They are a favorite meal for many larger animals, including whales and seabirds. When squid populations are healthy, there's plenty of food for these other creatures, which helps keep the whole underwater world in balance. Additionally, when squid eat tiny marine life like plankton, they help control those populations, preventing overgrowth that could harm the ocean.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these fun sea creatures!

      "description": "What are the differences between a freshwater turtle and a sea turtle? In Turtles for Kids, you'll learn the answer! As the name suggests, freshwater turtles love to live in rivers, lakes, and ponds. They have strong legs with webbed feet that make them excellent swimmers. On the other hand, sea turtles prefer to live in the big blue ocean. They have unique flippers instead of legs, which help them gracefully glide through the water.\n\nTheir diets differ too. Freshwater turtles are little chefs that create a menu filled with aquatic plants, insects, small fish, and even worms. They are omnivores and use their sharp beaks to munch on plants and small animals.Sea turtles have a slightly different taste in their underwater menu. These ocean wanderers are mostly herbivores and primarily dine on sea grasses and algae. Their strong beaks help them nip at the plants, making them efficient grazers in marine habitats. Sea turtles are also known to eat jellyfish and small invertebrates occasionally, adding a bit of variety to their diet.\n\nDespite a few other differences, freshwater and sea turtles are pretty similar when it comes to caring for their little ones. They both lay eggs in nests during a process called oviparous reproduction. Mama turtles carefully choose a good spot on land to bury their eggs. Then, they leave them to hatch on their own. Once the baby turtles hatch, they start their journey to the water. It's like a turtle family tradition\u2014laying eggs on land and letting the little ones walk into the sea after they hatch to begin their adventure.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these aquatic reptiles!

Ocean waves are created mainly by the wind. Other forces, like earthquakes and the moon's gravitational pull, can also cause waves. Let's dive deeper into the science behind ocean waves.\n\nWaves have several parts, including the crest and the trough. The crest is the top of the wave, and the trough is the lowest part of a wave. The distance between two crests is called the wavelength. The height of a wave is the distance from the trough to the crest. The size and shape of waves can vary depending on wind speed, the distance the wind travels across the water, and the ocean's depth.\n\nOcean waves are fascinating and complex. They form by the wind, the moon, and even underwater earthquakes. Waves affect our beaches and coastlines and play a critical role in the ocean's ecosystem. Now the next time you visit the beach, you'll know more about the science behind those crashing waves.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the science of waves!

      "description": "It's hard to imagine the United States having a king or queen. That's mainly because colonial Americans revolted against the King of England to become an independent nation back in 1775. In this video, you'll learn that the United Kingdom is the United States' most important ally and global partner. Royalty is still an essential part of its government. This includes the late Queen of England, or her more formal title, Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth Realms.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth was born in London, England, on April 21, 1926. Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, Prince Albert and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Prince Albert later would ascend to the throne to become the King of England. He changed his name to King George VI to honor his father. While this may seem confusing, past English royalty often changed their names when ascending the throne to symbolically start fresh.\n\nSo, what makes Queen Elizabeth II such an enduring and endearing historical figure? Her greatest legacy may be her unfaltering patriotism to her country. In every public activity, she placed her country first. Queen Elizabeth II was known for her optimism and the thoughtful way she balanced her royal duties with her unwavering commitment to her family. Queen Elizabeth II passed away on September 8, 2022. She will long be remembered for serving Great Britain and as a revered global public figure.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about how this incredible historical figure!

      "description": "Do you know what a black hole is? This video discusses the science behind the formation of these strange and mysterious phenomena. A black hole is a strange space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. It's like a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks up everything around it! Black holes are made when massive stars reach the end of their lives and collapse. This collapse creates a tiny, super-dense point called a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon. The event horizon is like a one-way door\u2014once something goes through, it can't come back out.\n\nSince black holes do not emit light, scientists cannot see them directly. Instead, they look for their effects on nearby objects. When a black hole pulls in material from a companion star, it creates a disk of gas and dust that heats up and emits X-rays. By detecting these X-rays, astronomers can identify the presence of a black hole. They can also observe how stars move around the black hole, which helps them determine its mass.\n\nBlack holes actually have a purpose in the universe. They help regulate the growth of galaxies by influencing the movement of stars and gas. Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies can cause powerful energy jets that can affect star formation. Scientists also think they help shape the structure of the universe itself.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the science of black holes!

      "description": "What do you know about Mercury, kids? Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the sun. Scientists named it after the Roman messenger god Mercury, known for his speed. This name fits because Mercury moves quickly around the sun, completing one orbit in 88 Earth days! Even though it is close to Earth, it's still about 48 million miles away at its nearest point. That's like traveling around the Earth nearly 2,000 times!\n\nOne interesting thing about Mercury is that it has no moons. That's right! While planets like Jupiter and Saturn have dozens of moons, Mercury has none. Scientists think this is because the planet is so close to the sun that the sun's intense gravity might make it hard for Mercury to hold onto a moon.\n\nA fun fact about this planet is that it has a magnetic field, but a very weak one. This is surprising because it's so small and has cooled down over billions of years. In general, planets with magnetic fields usually have a molten core. Mercury's size and temperature would suggest it has no magnetic field at all. But scientists think that its core might still be partly molten, despite its size. It's Mercury's mighty magnetic mystery!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the closet planet to the sun!
