      "description": "Have you ever heard of the water cycle? Maybe you've heard the word evaporation or precipitation. These are stages in the water cycle! In The Water Cycle for Kids, you will learn all four stages of this process, and you may even discover that you've seen it in action many times! You will also learn about how important it is to conserve freshwater on the earth.\n\nThe water you drink may possibly be millions of years old! This is because the earth has a certain amount of water that moves around the earth in different states and phases. The first stage is evaporation. This occurs when the sun heats the water in oceans, lakes, and other bodies of water to point that it turns into gas, and that gas evaporates into the air. Transpiration is similar to evaporation and occurs when plant leaves release water as water vapor into the air.\n\nCondensation is the third step. This is when the vapor in the air gets cold and changes back into a liquid. This is actually how a cloud forms! This is also the reason you see foggy mirrors after a hot shower. When clouds have too much water and get too heavy, it rains. When it rains, this is called precipitation, the final stage of the cycle. Then the whole cycle starts all over again! \n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the water cycle!

      "description": "Did you know pandas have interesting sleeping habits? Pandas for Kids teaches you lots of cool facts about these fun bears. Unlike some animals with specific sleeping times, pandas take naps throughout the day and night. They sleep about two to four hours and then wake up to eat more bamboo. This napping schedule helps them conserve energy and maintain their strength. Digesting bamboo requires a lot of energy. Pandas are excellent climbers, so they often find a comfortable resting spot in the trees to sleep. Plus, they can stay safe from predators.\n\nPandas live in the dense bamboo forests of China. The forests provide the perfect environment for the bears, offering plenty of bamboo to eat and trees to climb. Pandas are usually solitary animals, meaning they prefer to live alone rather than in groups. Each one has its own territory, which it marks with scent to keep other pandas away. However, they do come together during the mating season in the spring.\n\nRight now, pandas are considered vulnerable and are no longer endangered. However, there are still only around 1,800 left in the wild. They face threats like habitat loss due to deforestation and climate change, which makes it hard to find enough bamboo to eat. To help protect them, many organizations work hard to save their habitats and create nature reserves where pandas can live safely. Breeding programs in zoos also help increase the panda population. By protecting them, we also protect their entire ecosystem, which benefits many other plants and animals.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these iconic bears!

      "description": "Do you know what electricians do on a day-to-day basis? This video for kids explains the career of an electrician. The demand for electricians will be around for as long as electricity is produced! So far, there is nothing on the horizon that will replace electricity. Being an electrician is a safe choice for long-term employment. Most electricians work full time, and their projects might require that they work indoors or outdoors. They often have to work during storms and inclement weather if they specialize in power lines. If you like variety and working both indoors and outdoors, being an electrician might be a good career choice for you.\n\nThe minimum requirement for an electrician is a high school degree. However, many have two or four years at a technical school or college. The more education you have, the more in demand you will be. And you already learned why being in demand is important! In addition to education, electricians learn their trade in a multi-year apprenticeship or on-the-job training program. They learn electrical theory, blueprint reading, mathematics, electrical code requirements, and safety and first-aid practices.\n\nElectricians are essential to our modern society. They make repairs during storms, install electrical lines in new construction, and ensure your house's electricity is safe. A career as an electrician is gratifying. You get to provide people with a necessary service while working in a field you enjoy. That's why you should consider a career as an electrician!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about a career as an electrician!

      "description": "What do you know about the skunk that isn't related to its stinky spray? Skunks for Kids talks all about these furry black and white creatures. They are small mammals with an iconic color pattern. Most have black fur with white stripes or spots running down their backs and tails. But they can also be brown, gray, cream, or ginger. Skunks have small heads with pointed noses and round ears. Their most famous feature is their ability to spray a strong-smelling liquid from glands near their tails, when they feel threatened. This smelly spray helps them defend themselves against predators and other threats.\n\nSkunks have a varied diet and are considered omnivores, which means they eat plants and animals. Their diet includes insects, small mammals, birds, eggs, fruits, and vegetables. And their sharp claws and strong legs help them dig up grubs and worms from the soil. Skunks are opportunistic feeders, meaning they will eat whatever food is available in their habitat. They may also scavenge for food and feed on carrion, the leftover scraps from other animals' meals.\n\nThese fascinating animals play a vital role in the environment by helping control insect populations. They hunt and feed insects like beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. By consuming these pests, skunks help keep insect populations in check, which benefits plants, crops, and other animals. Additionally, skunks are scavengers and eat carrion, which helps clean up dead animals and organic matter from their habitat. This scavenging behavior contributes to nutrient cycling and helps maintain the balance of ecosystems.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these iconic bears!

      "description": "Why does lightning and thunder happen? Did you know thunder is the sound of lightning? In this video for kids, you'll learn about the science behind how and why lightning occurs. When lightning strikes, it's incredibly bright. The bright flash is caused by the rapid heating of the air around the lightning bolt. The air gets so hot that it expands quickly, making the loud noise we hear as thunder. Thunder is the sound of the air rushing back to its normal state after being heated. This is why thunder can rumble and roll for a long time.\n\nLightning actually plays a vital role in nature. It helps produce nitrogen compounds in the atmosphere. Plants need nitrogen to grow; lightning helps make this nitrogen available in the soil. So, in a way, lightning helps plants grow and keeps the environment healthy!\n\nScientists use special tools to study lightning. One tool is called a lightning detector. It can sense when lightning strikes and where it happens. This helps meteorologists, the scientists who study weather, predict storms and keep people safe. Lightning detectors are often used in weather stations to monitor storms and provide warnings.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this flashy phenomenon!

      "description": "Have you ever been to the country just north of the United States of America? In All about Canada for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about this cool neighbor of ours. For instance, Canada is the second-largest country in the world but is home to only about half of 1% of the world's total population! That's a lot of space for so few people.\n\nCanada is made up of 10 provinces and 3 territories. Ottawa, Ontario, is the capitol city, and the largest city is Toronto, Ontario. The second-largest city in Canada is Montr\u00e9al, Qu\u00e9bec. It's a major seaport and one of the biggest French-speaking countries in the world. After all, both English and French are the two official languages of the country. Nearly half the people in Canada have British ancestors, and around one-fourth have French ancestors. There is also a small group of First Nations people and Inuit who live there.\n\nLots of different animals lives among the mountains, plains, forests, and lakes of Canada.

      "description": "What do you know about beavers? In this video for kids, you'll learn quite a bit that you might not know. Beavers are mammals that live in streams, rivers, and ponds across North America, Europe, and Asia. They have unique features that help them live in water. They are known for their flat tails that look like a canoe paddle. Their fur is waterproof, keeping them warm and dry even in cold water. Beavers also have webbed feet that help them swim fast and dive under water.\n\nWhen beavers want to collect food under water, they use their fantastic swimming skills and sharp teeth. They dive down, using their front paws to grab branches and pull them to the surface. Then, they use their teeth to cut the branches into smaller pieces that they can carry back to their lodge or store under water for later. This clever way of gathering food keeps them well-fed throughout the year, even when it's hard to find fresh plants in winter.\n\nBecause they create unique habitats that support various plants and animals, beavers are incredibly important for the environment. Their dams transform flowing streams into calm ponds and wetlands, providing homes and food for fish, frogs, birds, insects, and other creatures. Wetlands play a crucial role in water filtering and maintaining quality, benefiting wildlife and humans downstream. By altering their surroundings in these ways, beavers boost the biodiversity of the area and support healthy ecosystems.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting mammals!

      "description": "What is the difference between a robotics engineer and a robotics technician? In Careers: Robotics for Kids, you'll learn a little about both career options.\n\nRobotics technicians use advanced tools and technologies to design, build, and maintain robots. A 3D printer and laser cutter are some of their most essential tools. Robotics technicians use them to carefully assemble electronic components and circuits. They also use special software to program robots and control their movements precisely. In today's fast-paced world, the demand for skilled robotics technicians is snowballing. Nearly every field, from manufacturing and healthcare to agriculture and space exploration, integrates robots into their work. As robots become more integrated into our daily lives, the opportunities for robotics technicians will only continue to grow.\n\nIf you love tinkering with gadgets and figuring out how things work, being a robotics engineer could be perfect for you! You could help make new robots that do all sorts of amazing things. Robots will make the world a better place. They will free humans from tedious tasks and allow them to do other creative activities. Robots are the future. As a robotics engineer, you could help create robots that help people with disabilities. For example, you might create a robot that allows people who can't walk to move around. Or you could build robots that clean up pollution. Maybe your interest is space. Robots are piloting spacecraft now. There are so many possibilities!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about careers in robotics!

      "description": "Do you know what the ISS is? On November 2, 2000, one American (Bill Shepherd) and two Russians (Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev) began living on the International Space Station. They started preparing the ISS for others and stayed for four months to finish making it habitable.\n\nIn November of 1998, a Russian rocket launched and carried the first piece of the International Space Station into space. The piece was called the Zarya control module. Two weeks later, the Endeavor\u2014a United States space shuttle\u2014carried the Unity node component. The first two pieces were joined together, and the building of the International Space Station was underway.\n\nThe current plan is for the space station to operate until at least 2028. After 2028, the fate of the ISS is unclear. Many scientists would like to replace it or renovate it for future use. No matter what happens, the International Space Station has been, and will continue to be, beneficial to many people for many reasons. NASA will also use what they learn to one day explore other worlds, reaching farther into space than ever before. The space station information will help prepare for human missions in the future.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the ISS!

They analyze data from weather satellites, radars, and other tools to predict the weather. This means they look at things like temperature, humidity, and wind patterns. Each day brings new challenges and discoveries.\n\nThese weather scientists can work in various settings, including weather stations, news stations, and research labs. They can work in more unique places as well, from snowy mountains to tropical islands, to understand weather patterns. They might specialize in severe weather, climate, or marine meteorology. Some even work with the government or military to help plan activities that depend on the weather, like launching rockets or planning outdoor events.\n\nIf you're interested in weather and enjoy science, this might be the perfect job for you. Whether you're fascinated by tornadoes, snowstorms, or sunny skies, you would have the chance to study it all. Meteorologists master the mysteries of the atmosphere. So, if you dream of predicting the weather and helping people stay safe in a unique way, consider a career as a meteorologist!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about a career in meteorology!

      "description": "What's the difference, or differences, between gators and crocs? Alligators and crocodiles might look very similar, but their physical characteristics have some essential differences. Alligators have broader, U-shaped snouts, while crocs have narrower, V-shaped snouts. When their mouths are closed, you can see the teeth of a crocodile sticking out, but a gator's teeth are mostly hidden. Alligators usually have darker, more blackish-gray skin, and crocodiles tend to have lighter, olive-brown skin.\n\nGators and crocs have similar diets but hunt in slightly different ways. Both of these reptiles are carnivores, which means they eat meat. They enjoy eating fish, birds, and small mammals. Sometimes, they might even eat larger animals like deer. Alligators usually hunt by lurking in the water with just their eyes and nostrils above the surface. When a prey animal approaches, the alligator snaps its powerful jaws shut with lightning speed to catch it. Crocs hunt similarly, but because they can live in fresh and salt water, they also catch animals that come to drink at the edges of rivers and lakes.\n\nAlligators and crocodiles are ancient animals. They have been around since the time of the dinosaurs, over 200 million years ago! This makes them some of the oldest living animal species on Earth. They are part of a group of animals called archosaurs, which includes dinosaurs and birds. And these reptiles have hardly changed over millions of years, so they are like living fossils.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these ancient reptiles!

Learning about things like recycling, saving water, and reducing waste can help keep Earth healthy for many generations. It's like a birthday for Earth, reminding us to take care of the place we call home. Earth is not just our home but also the home of millions of plants and animals that need our help.\n\nOn Earth Day, we can take action by learning more about the environment and how we can make a difference. Whether using less plastic, planting a garden, or learning about endangered animals, every small action makes a significant impact. It's about learning new ways to help our planet and sharing those ideas with others. Earth Day isn't just about one day of the year. We can learn from each other and share ideas to make our communities cleaner and greener places to live.

      "description": "What is an earthworm? In this video for kids, you'll discover that earthworms are small, tube-shaped animals that live in the ground. They have long, soft bodies that are made up of many segments which look like little rings. Each segment has tiny bristles called setae that help the earthworm move through the soil. Their mouths are located at the front end, and they use them to eat dirt and organic matter, which helps them get nutrients.\n\nThese slimy creatures are detritivores, meaning they eat dead and decaying matter. They never need to catch their food like other animals since it's all around them in the soil. By constantly eating and moving through the soil, they help break down organic material and mix it into the ground, creating a healthy environment for plants to grow. This process is called vermicomposting and is often used in gardens to improve soil health.\n\nEarthworms are very important for the environment because they help keep the soil healthy. Their\ntunnels allow air and water to reach plant roots, which helps plants grow strong. Earthworms also eat\ndead leaves and other organic material, breaking it down into smaller pieces. This process turns the\nmaterial into nutrient-rich soil, which provides essential nutrients for plants. Without earthworms, the\nsoil would not be as fertile, and it would be harder for plants to grow.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these unique animals!

      "description": "Emus are among some of the few bird species that don't fly. They are fascinating birds that are really tall! They stand up to six feet (almost two meters) high, which makes them the second-tallest birds in the world after ostriches. Emus have long, strong legs that help them run fast, almost as fast as a car! Their feathers are usually brownish, and they have tiny wings they don't use for flying.\n\nThese big birds have very powerful legs. But they aren't just for walking\u2014they help emus run super fast. They can even reach speeds up to 30 miles per hour (about 50 kilometers per hour)! This makes them one of the fastest birds on land. Their legs are also strong enough to jump high, which comes in handy when they need to escape from predators.\n\nCurrently, emus are not endangered. In fact, they are pretty common in Australia. However, protecting their habitats and making sure they have enough food and space to live comfortably are still important. Conservation efforts focus on stabilizing their populations so that they thrive in the wild.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting birds!

      "description": "Have you ever heard of a frogmouth bird? This kids video will teach you some really fun facts about this unique bird. Frogmouth birds are fascinating creatures with unique physical characteristics. They have large, wide beaks that look like a frog's mouth, which is how they got their name. Since they are nocturnal, they hunt at night when many of their prey are active. They rely on their excellent night vision and sharp hearing to find food in the dark. Their large, wide beaks are perfect for catching their prey quickly.\n\nOne of the coolest facts about frogmouths is that they are masters of camouflage. Their feather patterns blend so well with tree bark that they are almost invisible when sitting still. During the day, they perch on branches and remain motionless, using their camouflage to hide from predators like owls and hawks. If a predator gets too close, a frogmouth will freeze in place, stretching its body to look like a branch, to fool its enemies.\n\nFrogmouths are not considered endangered, but some species, like the Papuan frogmouth, face habitat loss. As forests are cut down for farming or building, these birds lose their homes and places to hunt. While many frogmouth species are still doing well in the wild, it's critical to protect their habitats to make sure they can survive in the future. Conservation efforts that protect forests and woodlands can help keep frogmouths and other wildlife safe.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these unique birds!

      "description": "Did you know Chicago dyes the Chicago River green every year for St. Patrick's Day? This video for kids will introduce you to a lot of facts you might not know about this fun holiday. The history of Saint Patrick's Day dates back to the 5th century. A man named Patrick was born in Roman England. At age 16, he was kidnapped and taken to Ireland as a slave. After his escape, Patrick later returned to Ireland as a missionary. He played a crucial role in converting the Irish people to Christianity. March 17 is believed to be the date of his death, so it has been marked in his honor ever since.\n\nToday, Saint Patrick's Day has evolved into a major public festival celebrated globally. Large parades in cities like Dublin, New York, Chicago, and Boston fill the streets with floats, music, dancers, and performers. In addition to parades, there are activities, parties, concerts, and other events celebrating Irish culture. A unique part of the Saint Patrick's Day celebration is the \"wearing of the green.\" This tradition is tied to Ireland's nickname, the Emerald Isle, and the green in the Irish flag.\n\nSaint Patrick's Day is a festival that has grown from its religious roots into a global celebration of Irish culture.

      "description": "What in the world is a cnidarian? Well, you may not have heard of cnidarians, but you definitely know some! In this video for kids, you'll discover fun facts about the animals that belong to this phylum, including jellyfish, coral, and sea anemones.\n\nCnidaria is a phylum that contains more than 10,000 species that live in both freshwater and saltwater environments. There are five classes of cnidarians, and jellyfish are found in four of them! What makes these animals unique is specialized cells called cnidocytes, which they use for capturing prey. They're basically stinging cells.\n\nCnidarians don't have any respiratory organs, but they absorb oxygen from the water and expel carbon dioxide. They also have no central nervous system, like a brain. But they do have a collection of neural tissue that could possibly be a processing center. These unique animals also have the ability to regenerate! So if they lose a certain part, it can grow back!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "What do you know about life cycles? In Metamorphosis for Kids, you'll learn about the life cycle of most insects and amphibians. All living organisms go through a life cycle. Different living things have different life cycles. Some living things look exactly like the parent, other living things (like humans) look like the parent with different traits, and others look much different than the parent.\n\nThere are two types of metamorphosis\u2014complete and incomplete. Complete metamorphosis consists of four stages, and incomplete metamorphosis consists of just three stages. Incomplete metamorphosis is sometimes called gradual or simple. The word metamorphosis comes from the Greek words meta, which means \u201cchange\u201d, and morphe, meaning \u201cform.\" To sum it up, the word means \u201cchange of form.\u201d\n\nAbout 90% of all insects undergo complete metamorphosis, which involves 4 stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Some, like grasshoppers, undergo incomplete metamorphosis, which involves three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Amphibians like frogs, toads, and newts also experience a 3-stage incomplete metamorphosis: egg, larva, adult.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about this interesting type of life cycle!

      "description": "Did you know you are a chordate? In this kids video, you'll learn a lot of interesting facts about chordates. All chordates are grouped into the phylum because, at some point in their life, they have a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits (gills near the pharynx), and a muscular tail. The tail could remain into adulthood or disappear during embryonic development. They also all have a closed circulatory system with blood that flows through vessels and a heart with ventricles.\n\nScientists think the very first vertebrates evolved around 525 million years ago, but they can\u2019t determine if it was Myllokunmingia or Pikaia gracilens. Try to say those words really fast! So while it feels like most of our planet is covered in vertebrates, only about 5% of all animal species are vertebrates.\n\nAll vertebrates have a backbone, an endoskeleton, two pairs of appendages, a skull, and a bilateral symmetry. And the animals in this phylum include mammals, birds, reptiles, fish, birds, and amphibians. Keep in mind that all vertebrates are chordates, but not all chordates are vertebrates!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the animals of this phylum!

      "description": "Did you know chimpanzees are similar to humans when it comes to caring for their young ones? It's true! In this video for kids, you'll learn that chimpanzees are excellent parents! Baby chimpanzees stay close to their moms and hold on to their fur when they need a ride. Moms make cozy nests for them to sleep in at night. Like human babies and children, chimps learn essential things from their parents, like how to find food and be safe in the jungle.\n\nDespite what people used to think, chimps are omnivores and eat both meat and plant foods. Because of their keen senses, they are excellent foragers and can easily locate delicious treats in the forest. Their eyesight is excellent for spotting fruits and other food high in the trees. They also have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out ripe fruits or fresh plants to eat. And when they're in the mood for some protein, like insects or small animals, their quick thinking and use of tools come in handy.\n\nThese amazing primates are also known for their impressive tool-making skills. Chimps can create tools from objects they find in the environment to help them get food or solve problems. For instance, they might use leaves as sponges to soak up water and drink from them. This kind of tool use sets them apart from many other animals and shows their ability to innovate.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these precious primates!

      "description": "Did you know adult hippos can hold their breath for five minutes under water? Or that they produce their own sunscreen to shield them from the hot sun? In Hippos for Kids, you will learn lots more fun facts about these large mammals. For instance, they are fast! They may look big and bulky, but these animals can run surprisingly fast.\n\nHippos like to live in groups called pods. These pods can have anywhere from a few hippos to over 100! Living in a group helps them stay safe from predators like lions and crocodiles. They can hold their breath for a long time, so they spend a lot of time in the water. Hippos are also known for being noisy animals. They make loud grunts and roars to communicate with each other.\n\nHippopotamuses might seem like big, water-loving animals that splash around and don't do much else, but they're essential for our environment. They are known as ecosystem engineers. This is because they create unique habitats in the rivers and lakes where they live. It might sound a bit yucky, but when hippos poop in the water, the nutrients in the poop help plants grow. These plants provide food and shelter for many other animals, like fish and birds. Hippopotamuses truly help make their homes a better place for all living creatures in the habitat.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these hungry herbivores!

      "description": "Still need costume ideas for Halloween? How about a koala! Koalas are cute and cuddly little animals. They have soft, fluffy fur in colors that range from gray to brown, helping them blend in with the trees where they live. They have big round ears and a large, black nose to sniff out their favorite food: eucalyptus leaves. Their sharp claws and padded feet make them excellent climbers, too, allowing them to grip tree branches securely.\n\nKoalas are herbivores, which means they only eat plants. And as you remember, their favorite food is eucalyptus leaves. Eucalyptus leaves are tough and not very nutritious, but koalas have particular adaptations to help them digest this food. They spend most of their time eating eucalyptus leaves and resting in trees. Naturally, they are excellent climbers. They have two thumbs on each front paw to help them grip branches and climb trees more efficiently.\n\nBelieve it or not, koalas have fingerprints that are distinct to each individual. These fingerprints are not only found on their paws but also on their nose! This makes each koala's nose print unique, like our human fingerprints. Scientists can use the nose prints to identify and track individual koalas in the wild, helping with conservation efforts and population studies.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these adorable marsupials!

      "description": "Did you know that you probably use magnets every day in one way or another? Magnets are everywhere, in doorbells and computers, in There are three kinds: temporary, permanent, and electromagnets. Temporary magnets become magnetized when a magnetic field is present. But they lose that magnetism once the magnetic field is gone.\n\nPermanent magnets are made from materials that are naturally or chemically magnetized, like iron or nickel. These are the magnets you would use on your fridge. Electromagnets are created by running an current through a coil with a metal core. The energized core creates magnetic field, and when the current turns off, the magnetic field disappears. An MRI machine is a great example of an electromagnet.\n\nThe earth itself is a magnet!

      "description": "What exactly is artificial intelligence? Did you know there are different levels? This video for kids discusses how people use AI and outlines some of the the pros and cons of using it. \n\nIf you have used Siri or Google Assistant, or asked a question to Alexa, then you are using a form of artificial intelligence. These all use voice recognition and machine learning to answer questions and respond to requests. If you have ever contacted customer service online to get help, then more than likely, your conversation began with a chatbot, a computer-designed program that simulates human conversation. Chatbots were not always considered AI because they could not learn or adapt. However, chatbots have recently become more sophisticated and are increasingly using the power of AI learning.\n\nThere are several beneficial uses for AI, and even more when you pair AI with robotics. For example, we are automating tasks that are unsafe for humans, like mixing toxic chemicals. Many of the products we use today incorporate some form of AI in making the products. But AI is expensive, it can be weaponized, and it can result in the loss of jobs for humans, among other things. While none of us can predict the future, AI is here. What we cannot do is overestimate the power of good or underestimate the potential for disaster. Do the pros outweigh the cons? You'll have to decide!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about artificial intelligence!

      "description": "Did you know that parrots are excellent parents? Did you know they can hold stuff with their feet? In Parrots for Kids, you will learn lots of interesting facts about parrots. It's a pretty well-known fact that these birds are very beautiful with their vibrant feathers of all colors! They're social birds too, so they like to live in flocks.\n\nYou might wonder why parrots can mimic sounds they hear. This is actually because of an extraordinary part in their brain called the song system. It allows them to learn and replicate sounds they hear in their environment. The skill is a way for parrots to communicate with each other and even bond within their flocks. They can use different sounds to express their emotions and intentions.\n\nSome species, like the Spix's macaw (or blue macaw), are very rare and critically endangered. This is due to several factors, such as habitat loss or the illegal pet trade. Not all species are in trouble, but for those that are, we need to do what we can to provide extra protection for their survival.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these beautiful birds!

      "description": "If you had to guess whether rhinoceroses were carnivores, omnivores, or herbivores, what would you say? Rhinos for Kids will teach you that the answer is herbivores! They have a plant-based diet that consists of grass, leaves, branches, and fruits. Scientists consider the rhino both a browser and a grazer. Grazing refers to when rhinos nibble on grass and other plants on the ground. But they also browse, which means they use their strong lips and teeth to pluck leaves and branches from trees and bushes. You could think of them like the giant lawnmowers of the savanna.\n\nWhen caring for their little ones, rhino moms are very protective. They use their muscular bodies to keep their babies safe from danger. Baby rhinos, called calves, stay close to their moms. While in their mother's care, they learn how to find food and stay safe in the wild. It's like going to school with their mom as their teacher!\n\nSadly, many species of rhinoceros are endangered today and at risk of disappearing from the wild forever. This is mainly because of poaching. Poaching (or illegal hunting) has caused a severe decline in rhino populations. Some people hunt them because they believe that rhino horns have unique, almost magical properties, even though no scientific proof of this exists. Conservationists and scientists are working very hard to protect these amazing animals and their habitats to ensure that they continue to positively impact the environment\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these marvelous mammals!

      "description": "Ever heard of the food chain? In nature, all living things are connected through something called the food chain. The food chain shows how energy moves from one organism to another. Every living thing needs energy to survive, and that energy comes from food. The food chain helps us understand who eats whom in the wild, and it also shows how energy flows from one level to the next.\n\nAt the bottom of the food chain are the producers. Producers are usually plants and other organisms that make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. Next in the food chain are the primary consumers. These are animals that eat plants, also known as herbivores. After the primary consumers come the secondary consumers. These are animals that eat herbivores. They are usually carnivores (meat-eaters) like foxes, snakes, and birds of prey.\n\nAt the top of the food chain are the tertiary consumers. These animals are often the largest and strongest predators, such as lions, wolves, and eagles. Tertiary consumers eat other carnivores and sometimes herbivores too. Because some have no natural predators, they are often called apex predators. Apex predators help keep ecosystems healthy by preventing any one species from becoming too dominant. Some apex predators eat tertiary consumers, making them quaternary consumers!\n\nWhen animals die, their bodies don't go to waste. Decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and earthworms break down dead plants and animals into tiny pieces. These decomposers return nutrients to the soil, which helps plants grow and start the food chain all over again. Decomposers are essential because they recycle nutrients and ensure that the ecosystem continues to function.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the food chain!

      "description": "What do you know about these hooded reptiles? In this video for kids, you'll learn why cobras have hoods and a lot more. Cobras are truly remarkable snakes with distinct physical features. They have long, slender bodies covered in smooth scales in various colors, including green, brown, and black. Their hoods, which they can puff up to appear larger and scarier when they feel threatened, set them apart from other snakes. These hoods are like their own special shields, and they use them to warn potential predators to stay away.\n\nCobras are carnivorous, and their favorite snacks include small animals like birds, rodents (such as mice and rats), and even other snakes! Cobras have long, sharp teeth called fangs that are hollow like tiny straws. When a cobra bites its prey, the venom flows from the fangs into the prey's body. This venom contains proteins and chemicals that can quickly paralyze or even kill the prey, making it easier for the cobra to have its meal.\n\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the hoods! Cobras have a fascinating ability to create unique \"music\" with their hoods, which is a form of communication. Their hoods are like musical instruments, and cobras can make rhythmic movements with them to send signals. When a cobra feels threatened or wants to warn other animals to stay away, it can open its hood. The display shows off the cobra's size and can make it look more intimidating.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these slick snakes!

      "description": "Do you know why killer bees are called killer bees? This video will enlighten your kids about the diet, behaviors, and habitat of the Africanized honey bee. That's right! Killer bees are also known as Africanized honey bees. This is because the ancestors from which they get their aggression are from Africa. (African honey bees are an especially hostile species.)\n\nAfricanized honey bees, though, actually have a mix of both African and European bee genes. They are known for their adaptability to hot climates and their ability to thrive in different environments. Those traits make them attractive to scientists who want to study how animals adapt to new homes.\n\nScientists gave these insects the nickname \"killer\" bees because of their aggressive behavior when it comes to defending their nests. And because killer bees have killed some humans! They are famous for being fast fliers and quick to protect their nests. When threatened, they form a swarm and chase away the intruders. Scientists call this behavior aggressive defense. It's like having a neighborhood watch that's always on high alert! When they swarm, their buzzing can be quite loud, which is their way of warning others to stay away.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these interesting insects!

      "description": "Did you know dragons really do exist!? Well, maybe not the flying, fire-breathing kind. In Komodo Dragons for Kids, you'll learn all about these interesting reptiles and why they are considered an apex predator. These dragons live only in Southeastern Indonesia on a collection of islands. They use strong, sharp claws and teeth to catch their food. They also possess a unique gland in their lower jaw that secretes venom that immobilizes their prey. Their long, forked tongue helps them gather chemical information from the air, allowing them to locate potential food sources.\n\nKomodo dragons are really good at sneaking up on their prey. They have a particular skill called ambush predation. It's like a surprise attack! They hide in tall grass or behind rocks, and when an animal comes by, they use their strong legs and sharp claws to pounce on it. Crazy enough, Komodo dragons have a secret weapon\u2014their saliva! Their spit is full of harmful bacteria that can make an animal sick. So, even if the prey they are after gets away, it might not survive for long.\n\nAs for whether Komodo dragons are endangered, the answer is a bit complicated. They are not endangered overall, but their situation is tricky. You see, people sometimes hunt the dragons, and their homes are getting smaller because of things like deforestation. This makes it harder for them to find food and safe places to live. So, even though they are not endangered everywhere, some groups of Komodo dragons are at risk. We need to protect their habitats and make sure they have enough food to keep being the fantastic nature helpers they are!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these regal reptiles!

      "description": "Did you know that the largest squid have the biggest eyes of any animal in the animal kingdom? It's true! Their eyes can be as large as basketballs. In Squid for Kids, you'll learn a lot more about these rocket-like creatures of the sea, including the fact that, like other ocean animals, they can glow in the dark because of their ability of bioluminescence.\n\nSquid are like the race cars of the ocean because they have a unique way of swimming: jet propulsion. They have a body part called a siphon that helps them shoot water out with great force. By doing this, they can zoom through the water at impressive speeds. Think of it like a squid's rocket engine! This ability helps them catch prey and escape from predators in the blink of an eye. As an added superpower bonus, they can shoot a dark cloud of ink in their predators' faces and jet away.\n\nNaturally, squid are part of the ocean's food chain. They are a favorite meal for many larger animals, including whales and seabirds. When squid populations are healthy, there's plenty of food for these other creatures, which helps keep the whole underwater world in balance. Additionally, when squid eat tiny marine life like plankton, they help control those populations, preventing overgrowth that could harm the ocean.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these fun sea creatures!

      "description": "What are the differences between a freshwater turtle and a sea turtle? In Turtles for Kids, you'll learn the answer! As the name suggests, freshwater turtles love to live in rivers, lakes, and ponds. They have strong legs with webbed feet that make them excellent swimmers. On the other hand, sea turtles prefer to live in the big blue ocean. They have unique flippers instead of legs, which help them gracefully glide through the water.\n\nTheir diets differ too. Freshwater turtles are little chefs that create a menu filled with aquatic plants, insects, small fish, and even worms. They are omnivores and use their sharp beaks to munch on plants and small animals.Sea turtles have a slightly different taste in their underwater menu. These ocean wanderers are mostly herbivores and primarily dine on sea grasses and algae. Their strong beaks help them nip at the plants, making them efficient grazers in marine habitats. Sea turtles are also known to eat jellyfish and small invertebrates occasionally, adding a bit of variety to their diet.\n\nDespite a few other differences, freshwater and sea turtles are pretty similar when it comes to caring for their little ones. They both lay eggs in nests during a process called oviparous reproduction. Mama turtles carefully choose a good spot on land to bury their eggs. Then, they leave them to hatch on their own. Once the baby turtles hatch, they start their journey to the water. It's like a turtle family tradition\u2014laying eggs on land and letting the little ones walk into the sea after they hatch to begin their adventure.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about these aquatic reptiles!

      "description": "Do you know how ocean waves form? This kids video explains the science of ocean waves and what causes them. One of the first things you probably notice when you visit the beach is the ocean waves that crash onto the shore. These waves may seem random, but they actually follow scientific rules and patterns. Ocean waves are created mainly by the wind. Other forces, like earthquakes and the moon's gravitational pull, can also cause waves. Let's dive deeper into the science behind ocean waves.\n\nWaves have several parts, including the crest and the trough. The crest is the top of the wave, and the trough is the lowest part of a wave. The distance between two crests is called the wavelength. The height of a wave is the distance from the trough to the crest. The size and shape of waves can vary depending on wind speed, the distance the wind travels across the water, and the ocean's depth.\n\nOcean waves are fascinating and complex. They form by the wind, the moon, and even underwater earthquakes. Waves affect our beaches and coastlines and play a critical role in the ocean's ecosystem. Now the next time you visit the beach, you'll know more about the science behind those crashing waves.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the science of waves!

      "description": "It's hard to imagine the United States having a king or queen. That's mainly because colonial Americans revolted against the King of England to become an independent nation back in 1775. In this video, you'll learn that the United Kingdom is the United States' most important ally and global partner. Royalty is still an essential part of its government. This includes the late Queen of England, or her more formal title, Queen of the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth Realms.\n\nPrincess Elizabeth was born in London, England, on April 21, 1926. Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, Prince Albert and Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. Prince Albert later would ascend to the throne to become the King of England. He changed his name to King George VI to honor his father. While this may seem confusing, past English royalty often changed their names when ascending the throne to symbolically start fresh.\n\nSo, what makes Queen Elizabeth II such an enduring and endearing historical figure? Her greatest legacy may be her unfaltering patriotism to her country. In every public activity, she placed her country first. Queen Elizabeth II was known for her optimism and the thoughtful way she balanced her royal duties with her unwavering commitment to her family. Queen Elizabeth II passed away on September 8, 2022. She will long be remembered for serving Great Britain and as a revered global public figure.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about how this incredible historical figure!

      "description": "Do you know what a black hole is? This video discusses the science behind the formation of these strange and mysterious phenomena. A black hole is a strange space where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. It's like a giant vacuum cleaner that sucks up everything around it! Black holes are made when massive stars reach the end of their lives and collapse. This collapse creates a tiny, super-dense point called a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon. The event horizon is like a one-way door\u2014once something goes through, it can't come back out.\n\nSince black holes do not emit light, scientists cannot see them directly. Instead, they look for their effects on nearby objects. When a black hole pulls in material from a companion star, it creates a disk of gas and dust that heats up and emits X-rays. By detecting these X-rays, astronomers can identify the presence of a black hole. They can also observe how stars move around the black hole, which helps them determine its mass.\n\nBlack holes actually have a purpose in the universe. They help regulate the growth of galaxies by influencing the movement of stars and gas. Supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies can cause powerful energy jets that can affect star formation. Scientists also think they help shape the structure of the universe itself.\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the science of black holes!

      "description": "What do you know about Mercury, kids? Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system and the closest to the sun. Scientists named it after the Roman messenger god Mercury, known for his speed. This name fits because Mercury moves quickly around the sun, completing one orbit in 88 Earth days! Even though it is close to Earth, it's still about 48 million miles away at its nearest point. That's like traveling around the Earth nearly 2,000 times!\n\nOne interesting thing about Mercury is that it has no moons. That's right! While planets like Jupiter and Saturn have dozens of moons, Mercury has none. Scientists think this is because the planet is so close to the sun that the sun's intense gravity might make it hard for Mercury to hold onto a moon.\n\nA fun fact about this planet is that it has a magnetic field, but a very weak one. This is surprising because it's so small and has cooled down over billions of years. In general, planets with magnetic fields usually have a molten core. Mercury's size and temperature would suggest it has no magnetic field at all. But scientists think that its core might still be partly molten, despite its size. It's Mercury's mighty magnetic mystery!\n\nWe hope you and your student(s) enjoyed learning about the closet planet to the sun!
