The Burmese Python, native to Southeast Asia, is thriving in this habitat but unfortunately is an invasive species that has slowly become a threat to other local wildlife and the overall stability of the ecosystem. It is believed a large number of these snakes have been introduced to the area by prior pet owners in an effort to rid themselves of a snake that has grown too large for their care. So in this episode not only will Coyote show you all of the cool features this enormous python has to offer but will also put into perspective just how large these snakes can become and why owning a burmese python is not a decision to make lightly.

From the black button eyes to the tiny fuzzy ears this playful mannered baby bear really is the teddy bear of the forest!   \n \nUnfortunately their cuteness and curiosity can land them in trouble as they tend to wander into camp sites or backyards following their noses for an easy meal; and it is these situations that often result in dangerous human encounters where innocent observers and bystanders are surprised to find out that Mama Bear is near by and that she will aggressively defend her youngster by any means necessary, including lethal force! \n\nIn this particular up close encounter Coyote Peterson is working with Bucky, a 4 month old Black Bear Cub who lost his mother and is now being raised in captivity as an educational ambassador. However don't let his playful disposition fool you, with razor sharp claws and a full set of teeth Bucky is already built to be a top predator! This is one wild hangout that you aren't going to want to miss! \n\n\nBreaking Trail leaves the map behind and follows adventurer and animal enthusiast Coyote Peterson and his crew as they encounter a variety of wildlife in the most amazing environments throughout North America!\n\nNew Episodes Every Tuesday at 9AM EST!\n\n\nWatch More Breaking Trail: https://www.animalist.com/breakingtrail\n\n \n\n\nSubscribe Now! https://www.youtube.com/user/BreakingTrail\n\n \n\n\nFind more info at: https://www.CoyotePeterson.com\n\n \n\n\nCoyote Peterson on Twitter: https://twitter.com/COYOTEPETERSON\n\n \n\n\nCoyote Peterson on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CoyotePeterson\n\n \n\n\nCoyote Peterson G+: https://plus.google.com/100310803754690323805/about",

On this episode Coyote is putting himself right in the strike zone and will intentionally take a sting from the Giant Desert Hairy Scorpion; the largest scorpion in North America! Yes that\u2019s right, stung by a scorpion on purpose! \n\nWhile seemingly foolish and NEVER recommended, the intention of this demonstration will aim to make the point that not all scorpions should be vilified as lethal killers. While it is true that some scorpions are incredibly dangerous the venom from the Giant Desert Hairy is really nothing worse than a bee sting. However, that\u2019s not to say it isn\u2019t creepy and nail biting\u2026hold onto your seat\u2026this episode is intense! \n\n\n*The Scorpion used in this episode was found in the wild and was released without harm or injury.

Due to this reality, it is unfortunately the case that many of these pet Alligators end up abandoned or neglected because their owners can no longer care for them properly\u2026which is a very sad situation for both the pet owners and animals alike.\n\nSo if you\u2019re ever in the mood to own a pet gator, do yourself a favor and just watch this video again so you don\u2019t end up like Coyote\u2026and for those of you that just want to see the CHOMP\u2026well, get ready\u2026here it comes! \n\n**NEVER ATTEMPT TO RECREATE WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN IN THIS VIDEO**\n\n\n\nBreaking Trail leaves the map behind and follows adventurer and animal expert Coyote Peterson and his crew as they encounter a variety of wildlife in the most amazing environments on the planet!\n\nThe Brave Wilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and amazing up close animal encounters!\n\nFollow along with adventurer and animal expert Coyote Peterson and his crew as they lead you on three exciting expedition series - Emmy Award Winning Breaking Trail, Dragon Tails and Coyote\u2019s Backyard - featuring everything from Grizzly Bears and Crocodiles to Rattlesnakes and Tarantulas\u2026each episode offers an opportunity to learn something new.  \n      \nSo SUBSCRIBE NOW and join the adventure that brings you closer to the most beloved, bizarre and misunderstood creatures known to man! \n\nGET READY...things are about to get WILD!   \nNew Episodes Every Tuesday and Friday at 9AM EST\n\nSubscribe Now! https://www.youtube.com/BraveWilderness\n\nFind more info at: https://www.CoyotePeterson.com\n\nCoyote Peterson on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CoyotePeterson\n\nCoyote Peterson on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CoyotePeterson\n\nCoyote Peterson on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/CoyotePeterson\n\nCoyote Peterson G+: https://plus.google.com/100310803754690323805/about",

It is not simply in their skin like a poison frog but is actually contained near the base of their heads in what is called the parotoid glands.\n\nWhat is even more fascinating, is that it is said that these glands are actually capable of spraying this toxin when they are squeezed or bitten by a predator. To demonstrate this effect Coyote Peterson will gently manipulate the glands of an invasive Cane Toad to not only show you what the poison looks like but also to see if it really does spray! \n\nGet ready\u2026because the poison's about to fly! \n\n\nBreaking Trail leaves the map behind and follows adventurer and animal expert Coyote Peterson and his crew as they encounter a variety of wildlife in the most amazing environments on the planet! \n\nThe Brave Wilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and amazing up close animal encounters! \n\nFollow along with adventurer and animal expert Coyote Peterson and his crew as they lead you on three exciting expedition series - Emmy Award Winning Breaking Trail, Dragon Tails and Coyote\u2019s Backyard - featuring everything from Grizzly Bears and Crocodiles to Rattlesnakes and Tarantulas\u2026each episode offers an opportunity to learn something new.\n      \nSo SUBSCRIBE NOW and join the adventure that brings you closer to the most beloved, bizarre and misunderstood creatures known to man! \n\nGET READY...things are about to get WILD!   \nNew Episodes Every Tuesday and Friday at 9AM EST\n\nSubscribe Now! https://www.youtube.com/BraveWilderness\n\nFind more info at: https://www.CoyotePeterson.com\n\nCoyote Peterson on Twitter: https://twitter.com/CoyotePeterson\n\nCoyote Peterson on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/CoyotePeterson\n\nCoyote Peterson on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/CoyotePeterson\n\nCoyote Peterson G+: https://plus.google.com/100310803754690323805/about",

Neither Ocelot nor crab was placed in the scene for the benefit of the video...it was simply a chance encounter between a predator and its pray and we just so happened to be there to witness what happened.\n\nOcelot\u2019s have a wide range stretching from Argentina to Texas and while they have fairly healthy populations in the topics they are extremely elusive and rarely seen by humans. There has never been another video like this and we feel so extremely fortunate to have had this incredible experience\u2026it\u2019s one encounter we\u2019ll certainly never forget. \n\nGet ready to see an Ocelot vs a Crab! \n\n*Big thanks to La Tarde Ecolodge and Roel for hosting the team at this location.

All you need is a small plastic container, some fresh sea water, and a keen eye to spot the well camouflaged marine life beneath the surface. While often challenging to find more than a couple species in a day this activity can be a fun way to learn about different marine habitats and all the cool animals that call them home.  \n\nGet ready, we\u2019re about to build one awesome aquarium! \n\n\n*Please never attempt to recreate what is seen in this video without proper permissions from state and local agencies or without the presence or consultation of a wildlife professional. We want everyone to be safe out there and to always follow the rules and guidelines set out to protect our wonderful wildlife and their habitats. \n\nHuge thanks to Nikko, Aiden, Dylan and the boys incredible grandparents for hosting us on this fun filled expedition!

Let\u2019s just say sneaking up on an Eagle is far easier said than done! Oh and did we mention there are ice cold rivers and grizzly bears in the way? Yeah, this location will test one\u2019s wilderness skills, that\u2019s for sure! \n\nTo help take on this challenge of filming wild Eagles the crew hired professional wilderness guide Joe Ordenez and brought along a giant, and we do mean GIANT, 600mm camera lens to help extended their camera\u2019s reach. \n\nSo will they be able to get the epic Eagle shot they\u2019re after?\n\nGet ready to find out on this wild Alaskan adventure! \n\nBig thanks to Joe Ordonez for making this adventure possible!

The Wolverine. Our story lands the team right in the middle of one of the most epic expanses of wilderness on the planet, Alaska.\u00a0\n\nGet ready for jaws, claws and one epic Wolverine Face-Off! \n\n\nHUGE THANKS to Steve Kroschel and his amazing team for hosting the Brave Wilderness crew and making this video possible.

It is this very index that became Coyote\u2019s roadmap for all of the painful stings he has endured over the past 2 years on the Brave Wilderness Channel.\n\nIn this exclusive interview Coyote and Justin will talk about their painful experiences in the world of stinging insects and will ultimately land at a very interesting crossroads.  Is the infamous bullet ant really the most painful sting in the world?  Or is it possible\u2026that an even more potent sting is yet to be discovered\u2026?\n\nGet ready to learn about the Origins of Sting!  \n\nIf you enjoyed this look into the Origin of Stings check out the documentary INSECTA featuring Coyote and Justin! - http://bit.ly/insectadoc\n\nHUGE THANKS to Justin for being a part of this episode.

Now in what may be his final pain index challenge ever, Coyote takes on the infamous sting of none other than the Warrior Wasp! \n\nThe Warrior Wasp, a beautiful iridescent blue paper wasp, lives in the dense jungles of Central and South America. Their stunning appearance is well complemented by their elaborate nests that adorn the rainforest canopies and can house hundreds of these winged insects. However don\u2019t let their beauty fool you, these speedy wasps pack a seriously powerful punch that can cause major injury and even death when swarmed in high numbers. \n\nNow the time has come for Coyote to return to home of the Bullet Ant to be stung by a Warrior Wasp! Will it be his worst and take the throne atop the sting index? \n\nGet ready to find out! \n\nBUY Mark's \"COYOTE R U OK?\" Shirt! - http://bit.ly/BWmerch\n\nSupplies are limited on this item, if orders exceed inventory a second run will be made.

These pollinators, that use their strong mandibles to bring nectar and small caterpillars back to the nest to feed their young, are actually not very aggressive. However, don\u2019t let their level of chill fool you, these speedy wasps pack a seriously powerful punch that can cause major injury and even death with its potential for allergic reactions. \n\nNow the time has come for Coyote to return to home of the Bullet Ant and Warrior Wasp to be stung by an Executioner Wasp!

We're taking you back through Coyote's painful, yet educational experience through the Sting Index!\n\nTo commemorate this painful journey, Coyote has created his OWN Sting Index poster and Tee Shirt just for you! Available now at https://www.shopbravewilderness.com/collections/sting-collection\n\nThese amazing and beautiful insects have given Brave Wilderness and it\u2019s community so much-- It's time for us to give back to them! A percentage of our proceeds from sales of the poster and tee will go directly to organizations that protect pollinators!!\n\nWhat can you do at home to support this cause? Taking one or all of these simple steps will help make your little corner of the Earth pollinator-friendly:\n\n- Plant a native flowering plant in your window box, flower pots or yard.\n- Reduce or don\u2019t use insecticides, look for natural alternatives instead.\n- Mow your lawn less. Clover and dandelions are great for pollinators.\n- Leave some ground bare for underground nesting species.\n- Provide sources of water, like a bee-waterer. It can be as simple as a small bowl, half-filled with marbles or small rocks, with water just below the level of the marbles.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW - http://bit.ly/BWchannel\u202f\u202f\nBe\u202fBrave\u202fand\u202fSTAY\u202fWILD\u202fin\u202four\u202fBrave\u202fWilderness\u202fmerch!\u202fShop\u202fnow\u202f-\u202fhttp://bit.ly/SHOPBW\u202f\nJoin\u202fthe\u202fBrave\u202fCrew\u202fand become an official member of our club\u202f-\u202f \u202f http://bit.ly/bravecrewofficial\u202f\u202f\n\n\nThe\u202fBrave\u202fWilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and up-close animal encounters.

Coyote and guest host Nazir Sall visit the renowned Endangered Wolf Center in Eureka, Missouri, to learn about some of our planet\u2019s most incredible endangered canid species. Under the guidance of the center\u2019s top canid keepers, Nazir learns how to gain the trust of a finicky fennec fox, prepare enrichment for the bizarre maned wolf, and finally help feed the most endangered canid in the U.S, the red wolf. Through this fun hands-on experience, Coyote and Nazir gain a better understanding of the critical role canids play in the environment and the conservation efforts to protect them.\n\nThank you to Meredith Joyce-Houghton for creating the incredible artwork in this episode!

Mosquito bites can leave behind much more than an itchy, swollen welt. These bloodsucking insects carry diseases responsible for more than 1,000,000 deaths each and every year. Is Coyote any match for 1000 of these notorious parasites? It\u2019s time to put his forearm to the test.\n\nAt Brave Wilderness, when it comes to quickly soothing our itchy painful bug bites, nothing beats Chiggerex.

The incredible Mozambique spitting cobra's venom-spitting defense mechanism sure is unique and incredibly toxic... but just how accurate are those blinding spit takes?! Coyote will don a face shield and protective goggles to get face to face with this intimidating cobra to find out for himself!\n\nThe Mozambique spitting cobra adds an extra element of danger with its ability to \"spit\" venom at potential threats. Venom in the eyes or mucus membranes of a would-be attacker will cause intense irritation and temporary blindness, allowing the spitting cobra the opportunity to escape.

Poaching, habitat loss, and genetic fragmentation have collectively pushed rhino populations to the brink of extinction. Illegal and deadly horn poaching is far and wide the greatest threat to rhinos. To deter this gruesome practice often calls for extreme measures\u2026 like chainsawing off a rhino\u2019s horn.  \n\nThis is the reality of the fight to save rhinos. \n\nIn this episode, Coyote\u2019s on-location at the Kariega Game Reserve shadowing the incredible Dr. William Fowlds as he conducts two important veterinary rhino procedures. It\u2019s a race against the clock to protect these vanishing giants before they\u2019re lost forever. \n\nWe have a plan to put things back on track.

These microscopic creatures are the larva stage of harvest mites, and in the larva stage they're so tiny they can't be seen with the human eye! But that doesn't stop them from feasting upon unsuspecting mammals that encounter a swarm. \n\nCoyote will try his hardest to become a bug bite buffet by venturing barefoot into the forest! \n\nBig thank you to Chiggerex for sponsoring this episode! Chiggerex is a unique pain relieving ointment that absorbs quickly into skin without leaving any residue and has a pleasant peppermint scent. Soothing relief for bug bites FAST!

Her devastated owner believed all hope was lost, until miraculously, weeks later, she was rescued! She'd been stranded on an uninhabited island in the Florida Keys for 30 days, and against all odds she survived.\n\nWhich begged the question: if Kiwi could survive 30 Days... can Coyote and Christina survive just 24 Hours?\n\nOn this adventure, Coyote and Christina are stranded alone on a deserted island in the Florida Keys for 24 hours and challenged to survive! They'll scavenge a shipwreck, build a fire, forage for resources, hunt for food, and attempt to survive the night.\n\nBig thanks to Kiwi and her family for starring in this episode! You may even meet the famous Kiwi at Southernmost Gift Shop in the Florida Keys.

      "description": "Our Sea Turtle is too cold! Help us save it https://neaq.org/brave\n\nWe found a Kemp\u2019s Ridley Sea Turtle, the rarest and most endangered on earth, beached and freezing cold in Cape Cod. Without immediate help this turtle has very little chance of survival. Join the rescue effort as we follow its journey to be rehabilitated and hopefully released to swim in the ocean again. Will our sea turtle survive? \u2026 watch to find out! \n\n \nRare and critically endangered sea turtles are freezing cold and washing up on the shores of New England each fall because of changing weather patterns. Luckily, we have joined forces with the conversation efforts to save these \u201ccold-stunned\u201d turtles which is led by the New England Aquarium and Mass Audubon. Each year hundreds of volunteers comb the sandy beaches of Massachusetts in search of these distressed turtles so they can be rehabilitated and released back into the wild. \n\nBig thanks to the staff and volunteers at the Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary and the clinical team and volunteers at the New England Aquarium\u2019s Sea Turtle Hospital. Without their tireless efforts thousands of critically endangered sea turtles would certainly not survive these increasing weather events. Please consider joining us in helping them!\n\nTo donate please visit https://neaq.org/brave\n\nYou can also help by sharing this video or signing up to volunteer yourself. The world needs sea turtles and the sea turtles need our help more than ever!\n\nSpecial thank you to the pilots and volunteers of Turtles Fly Too. Without these transports the Sea Turtle Hospital would be over capacity and many hundreds more sea turtles would be at risk. \n\nLast, but certainly not least, we would like to thank the participants of this video. Pam, Janette, Adam, Sasha, Chuck and Matt - thank you all so so much and we look forward to helping out again next season! \n\n\n\nThe Brave\u202fWilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and up-close animal encounters. SUBSCRIBE NOW and join the crew that brings you closer to the most beloved, bizarre and misunderstood creatures on Earth!\u202f\u202f\u202f \n\n. \n\n\nThis video was produced and filmed under permit ES69328D.

Covered from head to tail with thick spines this animal\u2019s self-defense gives Mark a hand full of pain trying to present its other interesting features. \n\nThen he sets off to find one of the last living relatives of the extinct Tasmanian Tiger, the Numbat. Will he find one? Watch and find out! \n\nDo you have any endangered species that live by you? If so, tell us about them in the comments and what you would do to save them from going extinct.

      "description": "See what it\u2019s like to get stung by the world\u2019s most venomous fish, the Stonefish!\n\nIn this video I'm back in Australia to show you where stonefish live, how they defend themselves with venomous spines and then I will test the venom on myself to see just how bad this sting is vs the other toxic fish I\u2019ve encountered before. First hand victims have claimed this is the most painful sting on earth. Now it\u2019s time to find out.\n\nMake no mistake, this is a very painful sting and I can\u2019t stress enough that I\u2019m a professional performing a controlled test. DO NOT try to recreate this video. Stonefish stings have the potential to be life threatening to certain individuals.\n\n\nBig thanks to Miller Wilson for helping our team locate and understand Stonefish behavior in creating this video. \n\nThe Brave\u202fWilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and up-close animal encounters.

      "description": "Brave Crew \u2013 an important note about this episode. The plant we feature, known as the Gympie Gympie, is nicknamed 'The Suicide Plant' due to the horrific pain it can cause to those unlucky enough to touch it. The trichomes of the Gympie Gympie inject venom straight into the skin, which can leave a person in unbearable pain.\n\nWhile 'The Suicide Plant' is just a colloquial term for this stinging plant, suicide is a very serious topic that should not be taken lightly. If you are experiencing mental health issues or are having suicidal thoughts, please seek advice from a medical professional or legal guardian immediately. \n\n-\n\nSTUNG by the Gympie Gympie, aka The \"Suicide\" Plant! It's the most painful stinging plant in Australia, and maybe the world. This week, Coyote Peterson takes on the sting of the Gympie Gympie plant, in order to showcase:\n\na) Exactly what the innocuous looking leaves of the Gympie Gympie plant look like.\nb) Why you should treat the Gympie Gympie plant with respect, never handle it, and only view it from a safe distance.\nc) That it's incredibly important to know about and pay attention to your surrounding environment... lest you run into a plant like the Gympie Gympie, and endure its incredibly potent and painful stinging power!\n\nMassive thanks to Ryan, Ses and Kevin the Gympie Gympie sniffer pup, for leading this adventure!\n\nAnd thank you to Meredith Joyce-Houghton for creating the incredible artwork in this episode!

A creature that has always been central to Brave Wilderness... A creature that could be lurking in the pond behind your house... A creature that is fabled for its infamous bite... But just how powerful is its bite?  Can a snapper actually crush bone? Can a snapper really sever a finger from a human hand? How does a human's bite force compare a snapping turtle's? All of these questions and more are answered in this incredible episode. \n\nCoyote begins by testing his own bite force at a local dentist office. He then teams up with Ray Tiller, a day-1 Brave Wilderness fan who has followed in Coyote's footsteps as a wildlife expert and adventurer, to conduct the ultimate snapping turtle bite test. \n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Ray Tiller of @FintasticFilms for his integral part in this episode.

To learn more about Chomps or to find one of 20,000 stores near you that carry Chomps go to https://chomps.com/coyote\n\n\n\n\nCoyote has endured some of the most painful stings in the animal kingdom, but how does that pain compare to a tattoo needle? In this unique episode, Coyote gets his first-ever tattoo and compares the sharp, stinging sensation of the needle to the bites and stings of various creepy crawlies! \ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1d\ud83e\udd9f\n \nThis decision to get a tattoo was about more than just about the pain comparison\u2014 Coyote emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the decision, as tattoos are permanent. While Coyote spent time contemplating whether to get one, the design choice was clear, as his tattoo carries a profound personal significance and reflects his immense respect and appreciation for the culture and people that inspired it.\n\nTune in to see the big reveal and find out how this experience compares to Coyote\u2019s sting-filled past!\n\n \n\n\nA special thanks to Curt Everitt of Enso Tattoo in Columbus, Ohio, for bringing Coyote\u2019s vision to life. Coyote also shares tips on making responsible tattoo choices, like choosing a licensed artist and thinking carefully about this lifelong commitment. \n\nWant to see more of Curt's art?

Get 50% off your first order at https://sundaysfordogs.com/WILDERNESS or use code \"WILDERNESS\" at checkout.\n\n\n\nGet ready for DOUBLE the sting as Coyote takes on two caterpillar contenders in this episode! First up, the giant cecropia moth caterpillar with its bristling spiked defense. Then, the tiny but fierce saddleback caterpillar steps up to the challenge. Coyote puts their stings to the test, comparing the pain and reactions from both using the Caterpillar Sting Pain Index. Which will pack the bigger punch? Tune in to find out and witness the intense (and educational!) face-off between these two bristly creatures. \n\n\nMany thanks to KC Clark and Diane Brooks, our Ohio caterpillar friends, for their work with these amazing creatures. \n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to our wild friend Christina Wilson for sharing her experience with the Saddleback Caterpillar and calling into the episode!

Thanks again to BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode!\n\n \n\nIn the deep blue waters off Costa Rica, Coyote, Mario, and Trent take on a grueling fishing challenge... Each has a goal:\n\nMario sets out to catch the powerful roosterfish\nTrent battles to hook a mighty tuna\nCoyote sets his sights on the sailfish, the fastest fish in the world\n\nBut these fish aren\u2019t just going to roll over. They\u2019re strong. They\u2019re elusive. And they push the team to the brink of exhaustion.
