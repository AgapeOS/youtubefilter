It is this very index that became Coyote\u2019s roadmap for all of the painful stings he has endured over the past 2 years on the Brave Wilderness Channel.\n\nIn this exclusive interview Coyote and Justin will talk about their painful experiences in the world of stinging insects and will ultimately land at a very interesting crossroads.

Now in what may be his final pain index challenge ever, Coyote takes on the infamous sting of none other than the Warrior Wasp! \n\nThe Warrior Wasp, a beautiful iridescent blue paper wasp, lives in the dense jungles of Central and South America. Their stunning appearance is well complemented by their elaborate nests that adorn the rainforest canopies and can house hundreds of these winged insects. However don\u2019t let their beauty fool you, these speedy wasps pack a seriously powerful punch that can cause major injury and even death when swarmed in high numbers. \n\nNow the time has come for Coyote to return to home of the Bullet Ant to be stung by a Warrior Wasp! Will it be his worst and take the throne atop the sting index? \n\nGet ready to find out! \n\nBUY Mark's \"COYOTE R U OK?\" Shirt! - http://bit.ly/BWmerch\n\nSupplies are limited on this item, if orders exceed inventory a second run will be made.

      "description": "On this episode, get ready to enter the STING ZONE again, and again, and AGAIN! We're taking you back through Coyote's painful, yet educational experience through the Sting Index!\n\nTo commemorate this painful journey, Coyote has created his OWN Sting Index poster and Tee Shirt just for you! Available now at https://www.shopbravewilderness.com/collections/sting-collection\n\nThese amazing and beautiful insects have given Brave Wilderness and it\u2019s community so much-- It's time for us to give back to them! A percentage of our proceeds from sales of the poster and tee will go directly to organizations that protect pollinators!!\n\nWhat can you do at home to support this cause? Taking one or all of these simple steps will help make your little corner of the Earth pollinator-friendly:\n\n- Plant a native flowering plant in your window box, flower pots or yard.\n- Reduce or don\u2019t use insecticides, look for natural alternatives instead.\n- Mow your lawn less. Clover and dandelions are great for pollinators.\n- Leave some ground bare for underground nesting species.\n- Provide sources of water, like a bee-waterer. It can be as simple as a small bowl, half-filled with marbles or small rocks, with water just below the level of the marbles.\n\n\nSUBSCRIBE NOW - http://bit.ly/BWchannel\u202f\u202f\nBe\u202fBrave\u202fand\u202fSTAY\u202fWILD\u202fin\u202four\u202fBrave\u202fWilderness\u202fmerch!\u202fShop\u202fnow\u202f-\u202fhttp://bit.ly/SHOPBW\u202f\nJoin\u202fthe\u202fBrave\u202fCrew\u202fand become an official member of our club\u202f-\u202f \u202f http://bit.ly/bravecrewofficial\u202f\u202f\n\n\nThe\u202fBrave\u202fWilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and up-close animal encounters.

The hero in this story is the Lake Erie water snake, and the villain, an invasive fish species known as the round goby, is wreaking havoc in the ecosystem. Sydney and Coyote are sent out on a snake scavenger hunt to capture as many Lake Erie water snakes as they can, which will help with ongoing efforts to protect this critical species.\n\nThank you to Meredith Joyce-Houghton for creating the incredible artwork in this episode!

Julia lives in the dry landlocked state of Arizona and has never seen an alligator or crocodile in real life, until now! Coyote starts Julia off with the unique experience of hatching a baby alligator from an egg! Next, they discuss the differences between alligators and crocodiles. The episode concludes with an alligator feeding frenzy as Coyote and Julia hand feed over 150 large and very hungry gators!\n\nThank you to Meredith Joyce-Houghton for creating the incredible artwork in this episode!

      "description": "This episode is sponsored by Chiggerex.\n\nIn this episode, Coyote\u2019s eaten alive by the world\u2019s deadliest animal: the mosquito. Mosquito bites can leave behind much more than an itchy, swollen welt. These bloodsucking insects carry diseases responsible for more than 1,000,000 deaths each and every year. Is Coyote any match for 1000 of these notorious parasites? It\u2019s time to put his forearm to the test.\n\nAt Brave Wilderness, when it comes to quickly soothing our itchy painful bug bites, nothing beats Chiggerex. For over 50 years, their unique formula with active ingredient benzocaine, soothing aloe vera and red-reducing chamomile has helped generations of people find relief.

The incredible Mozambique spitting cobra's venom-spitting defense mechanism sure is unique and incredibly toxic... but just how accurate are those blinding spit takes?! Coyote will don a face shield and protective goggles to get face to face with this intimidating cobra to find out for himself!\n\nThe Mozambique spitting cobra adds an extra element of danger with its ability to \"spit\" venom at potential threats. Venom in the eyes or mucus membranes of a would-be attacker will cause intense irritation and temporary blindness, allowing the spitting cobra the opportunity to escape. A last resort defense for the cobra is to bite and delivery a toxic envenomation that is considered a medical emergency! \n\nA FIELD GUIDE TO SNAKES & OTHER REPTILES OF KWAZULU-NATAL BY TYRONE PING - https://www.tyroneping.co.za/shop/\n\nBrave\u202fWilderness\u202fmerch!\u202f\u202f-\u202f http://bit.ly/SHOPBW\nSupport our mission! \u202f-\u202fhttp://bit.ly/bravecrewofficial\nJoin our Discord! - https://bit.ly/joinbravediscord\n\u202f \nThe Brave\u202fWilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and up-close animal encounters.

Poaching, habitat loss, and genetic fragmentation have collectively pushed rhino populations to the brink of extinction. Illegal and deadly horn poaching is far and wide the greatest threat to rhinos. To deter this gruesome practice often calls for extreme measures\u2026 like chainsawing off a rhino\u2019s horn.  \n\nThis is the reality of the fight to save rhinos. \n\nIn this episode, Coyote\u2019s on-location at the Kariega Game Reserve shadowing the incredible Dr. William Fowlds as he conducts two important veterinary rhino procedures. It\u2019s a race against the clock to protect these vanishing giants before they\u2019re lost forever. \n\nWe have a plan to put things back on track. Brave Wilderness is partnering with Kariega Game Reserve, Global Conservation Force and Bear Grylls to Save The Horns.  \n\nA massive thank you to Kariega Game Reserve, Dr. William Fowlds, Global Conservation Force, and to YOU for doing your part. \n\nThank you to Meredith Joyce-Houghton for creating the incredible artwork in this episode!

      "description": "Think you have what it takes to survive 24 hours on a deserted island?! \n\nIn 2016, Kiwi the 6-year-old long haired dachshund was lost at sea, completely gone without a trace. Her devastated owner believed all hope was lost, until miraculously, weeks later, she was rescued! She'd been stranded on an uninhabited island in the Florida Keys for 30 days, and against all odds she survived.\n\nWhich begged the question: if Kiwi could survive 30 Days... can Coyote and Christina survive just 24 Hours?\n\nOn this adventure, Coyote and Christina are stranded alone on a deserted island in the Florida Keys for 24 hours and challenged to survive! They'll scavenge a shipwreck, build a fire, forage for resources, hunt for food, and attempt to survive the night.\n\nBig thanks to Kiwi and her family for starring in this episode! You may even meet the famous Kiwi at Southernmost Gift Shop in the Florida Keys.

Help us save it https://neaq.org/brave\n\nWe found a Kemp\u2019s Ridley Sea Turtle, the rarest and most endangered on earth, beached and freezing cold in Cape Cod. Without immediate help this turtle has very little chance of survival. Join the rescue effort as we follow its journey to be rehabilitated and hopefully released to swim in the ocean again. Will our sea turtle survive? \u2026 watch to find out! \n\n \nRare and critically endangered sea turtles are freezing cold and washing up on the shores of New England each fall because of changing weather patterns. Luckily, we have joined forces with the conversation efforts to save these \u201ccold-stunned\u201d turtles which is led by the New England Aquarium and Mass Audubon. Each year hundreds of volunteers comb the sandy beaches of Massachusetts in search of these distressed turtles so they can be rehabilitated and released back into the wild. \n\nBig thanks to the staff and volunteers at the Wellfleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary and the clinical team and volunteers at the New England Aquarium\u2019s Sea Turtle Hospital. Without their tireless efforts thousands of critically endangered sea turtles would certainly not survive these increasing weather events. Please consider joining us in helping them!\n\nTo donate please visit https://neaq.org/brave\n\nYou can also help by sharing this video or signing up to volunteer yourself. The world needs sea turtles and the sea turtles need our help more than ever!\n\nSpecial thank you to the pilots and volunteers of Turtles Fly Too.

Covered from head to tail with thick spines this animal\u2019s self-defense gives Mark a hand full of pain trying to present its other interesting features. \n\nThen he sets off to find one of the last living relatives of the extinct Tasmanian Tiger, the Numbat. Will he find one? Watch and find out! \n\nDo you have any endangered species that live by you? If so, tell us about them in the comments and what you would do to save them from going extinct. Who knows, depending on your idea we might come out to film an adventure with you!\n\n\n\nBig thanks to Australia Wildlife Encounters for making this expedition possible and for providing permitting and guidance on the wildlife encounters featured.  \n\nThe Brave\u202fWilderness Channel is your one stop connection to a wild world of adventure and up-close animal encounters.

      "description": "Brave Crew \u2013 an important note about this episode. The plant we feature, known as the Gympie Gympie, is nicknamed 'The Suicide Plant' due to the horrific pain it can cause to those unlucky enough to touch it. The trichomes of the Gympie Gympie inject venom straight into the skin, which can leave a person in unbearable pain.\n\nWhile 'The Suicide Plant' is just a colloquial term for this stinging plant, suicide is a very serious topic that should not be taken lightly. If you are experiencing mental health issues or are having suicidal thoughts, please seek advice from a medical professional or legal guardian immediately. \n\n-\n\nSTUNG by the Gympie Gympie, aka The \"Suicide\" Plant! It's the most painful stinging plant in Australia, and maybe the world. This week, Coyote Peterson takes on the sting of the Gympie Gympie plant, in order to showcase:\n\na) Exactly what the innocuous looking leaves of the Gympie Gympie plant look like.\nb) Why you should treat the Gympie Gympie plant with respect, never handle it, and only view it from a safe distance.\nc) That it's incredibly important to know about and pay attention to your surrounding environment... lest you run into a plant like the Gympie Gympie, and endure its incredibly potent and painful stinging power!\n\nMassive thanks to Ryan, Ses and Kevin the Gympie Gympie sniffer pup, for leading this adventure!\n\nAnd thank you to Meredith Joyce-Houghton for creating the incredible artwork in this episode!

      "description": "Download Opera for free using https://opr.as/Opera-browser-bravewilderness  Thanks again to Opera for sponsoring this video! \n\n\n\nThe snapping turtle... A creature that has always been central to Brave Wilderness... A creature that could be lurking in the pond behind your house... A creature that is fabled for its infamous bite... But just how powerful is its bite?  Can a snapper actually crush bone? Can a snapper really sever a finger from a human hand? How does a human's bite force compare a snapping turtle's? All of these questions and more are answered in this incredible episode. \n\nCoyote begins by testing his own bite force at a local dentist office. He then teams up with Ray Tiller, a day-1 Brave Wilderness fan who has followed in Coyote's footsteps as a wildlife expert and adventurer, to conduct the ultimate snapping turtle bite test. \n\n\n\nSpecial thanks to Ray Tiller of @FintasticFilms for his integral part in this episode.

To learn more about Chomps or to find one of 20,000 stores near you that carry Chomps go to https://chomps.com/coyote\n\n\n\n\nCoyote has endured some of the most painful stings in the animal kingdom, but how does that pain compare to a tattoo needle? In this unique episode, Coyote gets his first-ever tattoo and compares the sharp, stinging sensation of the needle to the bites and stings of various creepy crawlies! \ud83d\udc1c\ud83d\udc1d\ud83e\udd9f\n \nThis decision to get a tattoo was about more than just about the pain comparison\u2014 Coyote emphasizes the importance of carefully considering the decision, as tattoos are permanent. While Coyote spent time contemplating whether to get one, the design choice was clear, as his tattoo carries a profound personal significance and reflects his immense respect and appreciation for the culture and people that inspired it.\n\nTune in to see the big reveal and find out how this experience compares to Coyote\u2019s sting-filled past!\n\n \n\n\nA special thanks to Curt Everitt of Enso Tattoo in Columbus, Ohio, for bringing Coyote\u2019s vision to life. Coyote also shares tips on making responsible tattoo choices, like choosing a licensed artist and thinking carefully about this lifelong commitment. \n\nWant to see more of Curt's art?

In this wild adventure, Coyote heads to California\u2019s coastline to learn about one of the ocean's most bizarre creatures. Watch as he ventures out to catch these elusive animals, observes their peculiar feeding habits, and puts their bite\u2014and their astonishing slime\u2014to the ultimate test.\n\nHagfish slime is unlike anything else in the animal kingdom. This remarkable substance, capable of suffocating a shark, has baffled scientists for years, who have yet to replicate its properties.
