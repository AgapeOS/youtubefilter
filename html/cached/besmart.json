I take a look at out how our numbers stack up to some other domains of life. It turns out that biomass, or what things weigh, can be more important than how many of something there are. Find out how our numbers stack up against everything from bugs to bacteria, and get ready for some mind-blowing numbers!\n\nFor more on the numbers in the video, check out the blog: http://www.itsokaytobesmart.com/post/41790778768/episode-extra-life-by-the-numbers-how-do-we-know\n \nHave an idea for an episode or an amazing science question you want answered?

And it's remarkable that in every society that we have looked at on Earth, romantic love exists. So if love is so universal, and there are 7 billion other people out there looking for it, why can it seem like it's so hard to find?\n\nIn this episode, we'll look at what we can learn about the search for love from the search for extraterrestrial life. We'll start with Enrico Fermi's paradox of why we haven't been contacted by any extraterrestrials yet, and then at Frank Drake's equation to estimate the number of civilizations that might exist in our galaxy (updated with current numbers). Finally, we'll meet a young lady named Ann and see if we can calculate how many special someones there might be out there for her.

Modern neuroscience says our brains may be wired to pick certain emotions out of music because they remind us of how people move!\n\nHumans are the only species we know that creates and communicate using music, but it's still unclear how or why we do that, brain-wise. Is it just a lucky side effect of evolution, like Steven Pinker says? Or is it a deeper part of our evolutionary history, as people like Mark Changizi and Daniel Levitin argue?\n\nNew evolutionary science says that we may read emotion in music because it relates to how we sense emotion in people's movements. We'll take a trip from Austin to Dartmouth to Cambodia to hear why music makes us feel so many feels. The connections between movement and music go far beyond dance moves!\n\nMike over at Idea Channel has a different opinion, head on over and check it out: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWWYE4eLEfk \n\nReferences for this episode: http://dft.ba/-5ECR \n\nSpecial thanks to Dartmouth's Thalia Wheatley and Beau Sievers, who did the research.

In the near-vacuum of space, there is nothing to transmit the physical waves that we need to perceive sound. But that doesn't mean we can't MAKE sound from space. This week, I feature several artists using scientific data to create \"space sonification\" projects. From the longest palindrome ever created to a chorus created from Earth's magnetic field, these pieces lie at the intersection of art and science.

And now, thanks to modern astronomy, we know that the Milky Way is home to perhaps a hundred billion planets! In the past two decades, these exoplanet discoveries have spawned new questions about our universe, and if there might be another Earth, or other life, somewhere out there.\n\nIn part 1 of our two-part series on exoplanets, we'll look at how astronomers find exoplanets, and what it means to call them Earth-like. We'll trace the history of planetary science back three thousand years and examine Earth's changing status in the cosmos.

To support your local station, go to: http://to.pbs.org/DonateOKAY\n\u2193 More info and sources below \u2193\n\nA poet once said, \"The whole universe is in a glass of wine.\" We will probably never know in what sense he said that, for poets do not write to be understood. But it is true that if we look in glass of wine closely enough we see the entire universe    There are the things of physics: the twisting liquid which evaporates depending on the wind and weather, the reflections in the glass, and our imagination adds the atoms. The glass is a distillation of the earth's rocks, and in its composition we see the secrets of the universe's age, and the evolution of the stars. What strange array of chemicals are in the wine? How did they come to be? There are the ferments, the enzymes, the substrates, and the products. There in wine is found the great generalization: all life is fermentation. Nobody can discover the chemistry of wine without discovering the cause of much disease. How vivid is the claret, pressing its existence into the consciousness that watches it!\n\nIf in our small minds, for some convenience, divide this glass of wine, this universe, into parts - physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on - remember that nature does not know it! So let us put it all back together, not forgetting ultimately what it is for. Let us give one more final pleasure: drink it and forget it all!\n\nGet Feynman's Lectures on Physics in book form: http://bit.ly/OKfeynman \n\n\"The Universe in a Glass of Wine\" ... a poem by Richard Feynman, as delivered in the Feynman Lectures on physics.

The meter is the world\u2019s ultimate measure, but how did it become \u201cthe\u201d meter? What is this measurement based on? The story of this revolution in measurement traces its roots to the French Revolution. Scientists decided that an equal and united people should have equal and united measures. So they sent a pair of young astronomers out to measure the world, and invent the meter. Little did they know they\u2019d find nothing but war, deception, and strife along the way. As a result of this ill-fated mission, the meter carries an error that still persists today. Still think the metric system is so perfect? \n\nViewers like you help make PBS (Thank you \ud83d\ude03) .

The real human story is much richer and more complex, full of branches, gaps, and shadowy parts. A century and a half of fossil finds tells us perhaps two dozen human species lived on Earth between now and the time when our ancestors split from chimpanzee ancestors.

Just 50,000-100,000 years ago, Earth was home to three or four separate human species, including our most famous cousins: the Neanderthals. New research has shown that Neanderthals were not the brutish, unintelligent cavemen that cartoons make them out to be. They were creative, smart, social, and perhaps even had complex language. So why did they go extinct as soon as Homo sapiens moved into their territory? Does any trace of them live on today? Why don\u2019t we have Neanderthal neighbors?\n\n-----------\nREFERENCES:\n\nPapagianni, Dimitra, and Michael A. Morse. The Neanderthals Rediscovered: How Modern Science Is Rewriting Their Story.

How were they able to stack two million stone blocks, each weighing more than two tons, into precise geometric alignments that would survive more than 4,000 years and capture the imaginations of explorers throughout history?

Most of Earth\u2019s precious and rare metals are locked too far in the crust for us to get at them, and launching them to space is too expensive for us to supply large colonies off Earth or explore far off worlds. How do we get our hands on the planetary resources inside asteroids? Let\u2019s find out!\n\nSpecial thanks to Kelly and Zach Weinersmith for working with us on this video.

Blue rocks, blue sky, blue water, sure. But blue animals? They are few and far between. And the ones that do make blue? They make it in some very strange and special ways compared to other colors. In this video, we'll look at some very cool butterflies to help us learn how living things make blue, and why this beautiful hue is so rare in nature.\n\nSPECIAL THANKS:\nSmithsonian Institution - National Museum of Natural History\nBob Robbins, Ph.D. - Curator of Lepidoptera\nJuan Pablo Hurtado Padilla - Microscope Educator\n\nRichard Prum, Ph.D. - Yale University\nVinothan Manoharan, Ph.D. - Harvard University\n\nSOURCES:\n\nBagnara, J.

As our species approaches 8 billion, human overpopulation is a major concern for many people. How can we reduce poverty and our impact on the environment? Do we need a forced one-child policy or something? Maybe not, because when we look at the science and history, populations seem to control themselves.

Why is that? Especially in populations like lions or elephant seals, where most males don\u2019t get to mate? That\u2019s survival of the laziest, not survival of the fittest. It turns out that in most cases, an equal balance of the sexes is the evolutionary stable strategy. From Charles Darwin to Ronald Fisher to W.D.

Peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, and even milk\u2026 the list of possibly dangerous foods seems to get longer every day. But why do some people\u2019s bodies have deadly reactions food?  And why are food allergies on the rise? In this video we explain what food allergies really are, and what the difference is between food allergy and food intolerance. Some fellow YouTubers tell us their stories of what it\u2019s like to live with food allergies, and we bring you the best current science on how to prevent food allergies in kids and adults. It\u2019s a tough nut to crack. #FoodAllergy #Allergies #FoodScience\n\nSpecial thanks to WheezyWaiter and Emily Graslie for sharing their food allergy stories with us!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/wheezywaiter \nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/thebrainscoop \n\nWant to learn more about allergies?

What happens inside a chrysalis to turn a caterpillar into a beautifully painted butterfly? Does it really turn to soup? I visited Dr. Arnaud Martin, who uses the CRISPR genetic modification technology to learn about how genes build bodies. Dr. Martin uses CRISPR to disrupt certain genes, and then looks for changes in butterfly wing patterns, creating designs we never see in nature. This tells us which genes control which part of the \"wing painting\" process. In the process of visiting Dr. Martin\u2019s lab, I had my mind blown about what REALLY happens during butterfly metamorphosis. You will too. #butterflies #CRISPR #genetics\n\nSpecial thanks to Arnaud Martin and the entire Martin Lab at George Washington University\nhttps://dnacrobatics.com\n\nChrysalis window timelapses courtesy of Aaron Pomerantz from the lab of Dr. Nipam Patel. http://www.patellab.net/\nCheck out Aaron\u2019s YouTube channel: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHr0u7Jsktou2CFl2GhTxYA\n\nSOURCES:  https://sites.google.com/view/painting-wings-with-crispr/home \n\nThe Great Courses Plus is currently available to watch through a web browser to almost anyone in the world and optimized for the US, UK, and Australian markets.

Well, maybe you aren't. In this video, we explore the idea of human chimeras. In mythology, the \"Chimaera\" was a beast made from different animals combined into one. But in biology, a chimera is a single organism whose body is made from parts of two or more genetically distinct individuals of the same species. Biological chimeras were once thought to be rare, but modern genetics has shown us that these genetic mashups are so common, that you yourself may actually be a chimera. And even if you don't have part of another body in you, your body is certainly not just one thing. We also discuss the idea of mosaicism and how it relates to cancer, Tasmanian devils, and circus sideshow attractions. #genetics #chimera \n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Emily Zarka, our favorite monsterologist!\n\nSOURCES:  https://sites.google.com/view/human-chimeras-references/home \n\n-----------\nFOLLOW US for more curiosity:\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\n http://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmart \n\nBooks from our episodes:\nhttp://smart-books.tumblr.com/",

And it was just this year, in 2019, when we finally saw the first picture of a black hole! But how to you take a photo of something so massively dense that not even light can escape its gravitational pull?

Over six episodes we travel to telescopes, go inside space research centers, and chat with amazing scientists to bring you the most exciting stories about space.

And let me tell you, the story of our moon is a VIOLENT one. It involves the word \u201cmagmoon\u201d. That\u2019s an awesome word!

Not REALLY dark, anyway. Not like it used to. Light pollution is not only making it more difficult to see the night sky, but it's also affecting our health. For the past century and a half, since the dawn of electric light, we\u2019ve been losing our connection to the night. We need artificial light for modern society, of course. The problem is, we need darkness for our health, and for the health of wildlife and ecosystems, and we\u2019re not getting enough of it. I traveled to McDonald Observatory in far west Texas, one of the darkest places in North America, to learn what people are doing in order to preserve dark skies, and to see truly dark skies for myself (and so I could show them to you!). This video features time lapse night sky images that I\u2019ve been collecting for the past few years, and I hope they make you feel something special. Turn out the lights, keep looking up, and don\u2019t be afraid of the dark. \n#lightpollution #darkskies #astronomy\n\nSOURCES/MORE INFO: https://sites.google.com/view/light-pollution-sources/home\n\n-----------\nFOLLOW US for more curiosity:\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/ \n\nBooks from our episodes:\nhttp://smart-books.tumblr.com/",

But I read it in science papers and articles by journalists, so I believed it without question. I even made one of my first videos based on this fact. Problem is, this fact is not true. So how did it remain firmly planted in our common knowledge for almost four decades without any scientific scrutiny? And how can you prepare yourself to not be fooled by other scientific urban legends? I look at a few of the most famous incorrect factoids in science, and give a few suggestions for how to make our common knowledge more correct.\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/7-scientific-urban-legends/home \n\nPlease do not watch this old video, it is wrong and my hair is awful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BZME8H7-KU\n\n\n-----------\nJoin us on Patreon! \nURL\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmart \n\nBooks from our episodes:\nhttp://smart-books.tumblr.com/",

Or maybe a B- at best. That\u2019s because the human body is full of design flaws. Except they aren\u2019t really design flaws, because the human body wasn\u2019t designed. It was evolved, and it is still evolving. And that means some of our parts don\u2019t work as well as they could, they just work well enough.

They\u2019re more environmentally sustainable and more humane than other sources of animal protein. Can they really catch on in western diets? I\u2019m a pretty adventurous eater, but I\u2019ve never actually tried edible insects. So when I got invited to an edible insect Thanksgiving feast, I had to say yes. Along the way I learned that eating bugs isn\u2019t really that new for humans, and that this really could be a delicious food we all eat in the near future. \n\nReferences:\nLesnik, Julie J. \u201cEdible Insects and Human Evolution\u201d.

We use it in our drinks, slip on it, skate on it, worry about climate change melting it. But have you ever stopped to really think about this stuff? The freezing and melting of water affects so much of our world. It\u2019s ice crystals in thunderclouds that create lightning. Ice is powerful enough crack boulders, float stones, and alter entire landscapes. Ice is such a common substance, you'd think we'd know everything about it by now. But it has some secrets and weird properties we\u2019ve only just begun to figure out. One question about ice that's, still not totally answered, is one of the most obvious: why is ice slippery?

And they were able to do it because a lot of extremely smart and dedicated people pushed engineering and chemistry to the limits in order to create a 36-story tower of carefully-controlled space fire powerful enough to escape Earth\u2019s gravity.

For eons, nature has relied on photosynthesis as a big way to keep carbon dioxide levels from getting out of control. But as we have put more carbon into the air, we\u2019ve also cut down many of the forests we need to suck that carbon up. So big tree-planting initiatives like #TeamTrees to the rescue, right? Actually, we need to think bigger. Here\u2019s three ways trees really can help us solve climate change, from a guy who wants to plant a TRILLION trees, to how we might save the forests we\u2019ve got, to scientists hacking biology to make trees even better. \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/3waystreescansavetheclimate/home\n\nAspect Science: Team Trees Explained https://youtu.be/SLHCA-hHx4Y \n\nSpecial thanks to Felix Finkbeiner\nhttps://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/home \n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\nAlecZero\nBob Rosset\nBrent M.\nDiego Lombeida\nRon Kakar\n\n-----------\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/",

It shows that some things change faster over time. You could apply it to life expectancy. Or compound interest. Or any number of things. But especially population growth. Back in 1798, a guy named Thomas Malthus noticed that not everything grows this way. And this caused people to worry because they were sure it would lead to massive death and starvation and famine. But that didn\u2019t happen, thanks to something called the Green Revolution and a guy named Norman Borlaug.

They are safe for almost everyone to wear, and the more people that wear them along with adhering to physical distancing and other strategies, then that's more lives we'll save. But there's still a lot of confusion and misinformation out there when it comes both to wearing masks and the actual risks of getting infected with COVID-19. In this video, I address a few of the most common myths and misunderstandings using scientific evidence. #WearAMask\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:46 Myth 1: Farts vs. viral particles\n02:20 Myth 2: Cloth masks can't stop viruses\n03:25 Myth 3: Oxygen deprivation/CO2 poisoning\n05:40 Myth 4: Toxins\n06:41 Myth 5: I feel healthy so I don't need a mask\n07:51 Myth 6: Masks aren't 100% effective, so why wear one?\n08:34 Mask-wearing history\n09:25 Myth 7: Government mask exemptions\n10:24 Myth 8: COVID isn't a big deal\n12:09 Conclusion\n\nWatch our previous video about masks: https://youtu.be/0Tp0zB904Mc \n\nOur entire COVID-19 playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsmqeqKj7M-pvu23aAUn6gtvDZAymnZ0K\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/covid-mask-myths-references/home \n\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\nAlecZero\nDiego Lombeida\nDustin\nErnesto Silva\nGeorge Gladding\nJay Stephens\nMarcus Tuepker\nMegan K Bradshaw\nPeter Ehrnstrom\nRon Kakar\nRobert Young\nvincbis\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/",

Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m here to set you straight on what a neuron is, what an action potential is, and how fast your nervous system really communicates.\n\nNeuron spiker box from Backyard Brains (they didn\u2019t sponsor this video in any way, but their kits are very educational!) https://backyardbrains.com/ \n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/galvani-nerve-brain/home \n\nSUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss a video! \u25ba\u25ba http://bit.ly/iotbs_sub\n\n-----------\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nAndrew Campbell \nBrian Chang\nRoy Lasris\nJavier Soto\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nZenimal\nSalih Arslan\nBaerbel Winkler\nRobert Young\nAmy Sowada\nBenjamin Teinby\nEric Meer\nPeter Ehrnstrom\nDustin\nMarcus Tuepker\nKaren Haskell\nAlecZero\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/",

You might think the obvious answer is \u201creproduction\u201d but there are plenty of organisms on Earth that don\u2019t require sex to reproduce. And the more that scientists examined sex, they more they realized that it\u2019s an expensive and inefficient way to get your genes to the next generation. The true purpose of sex is actually one of the longest-standing mysteries in evolutionary biology. But scientists are closer than ever to finding the answer.

In this special limited series, Emily Graslie and Trace Dominguez join me as we explore the universal rules of life that tie together Earth\u2019s living systems. In episode 6, we investigate a mystery. Millennia ago, while much of the Earth was covered in ice, enormous animals lived on every continent except Antarctica. Species like ground sloths, mammoths, gomphotheres, sabertooth cats, even wombats the size of cars! Today, Africa is the only continent where these megafaunas still exist. Why? What happened to the rest of Earth\u2019s giants?\n\nIn Our Nature is a special miniseries produced by It\u2019s Okay To Be Smart for PBS.

You might not expect it, but looking at life through the lens of physics can teach us a lot about why interesting groups of atoms like you and me exist.\n\nLearn more about Professor Brian Cox here:\nhttps://twitter.com/ProfBrianCox \nhttps://www.instagram.com/profbriancox/ \nhttps://www.facebook.com/ProfessorBrianCox \n\nATP Synthase animations by Drew Berry (wehi.tv) courtesy of HHMI Biointeractive and WEHI\n\n-----------\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nAli Freiburger\nAmy Sowada\nAttila Pix\nBaerbel Winkler\nBarbora Bei\nBurt Humburg\nClinger-Hamilton Family\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nDeliciousKashmiri\nDustin\nEric Meer\nKaren Haskell\nKen Board\nMehdi Damou\nRobert Young\nRoy Lasris\nSalih Arslan\n\nWe\u2019re on PATREON!

In particular, how our brains accomplish the incredible feat of constructing a three-dimensional reality using nothing but 2-D images from our eyes. A young artist and psychology researcher named Adelbert Ames, Jr. developed a series of illusions that help us understand how this process of constructing reality actually works. Sometimes we need to be fooled in order to gain understanding.\n\nWe'd like to acknowledge Dr. Phil Kellman from UCLA for his helpful discussions about the principles of spatial perception at play in these illusions https://kellmanlab.psych.ucla.edu/ \n\nSpecial thanks to Brian from Real Engineering for 3D printing the anamorphic cube for me! https://www.youtube.com/c/RealEngineering \n\nReferences used in this episode: https://sites.google.com/view/references-ames-illusions/home \n\n-----------\nWe\u2019re on PATREON! \nJoin the community https://www.patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nSpecial thanks to our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nAli Freiburger\nAmy Sowada\nAttila Pix\nBaerbel Winkler\nBarbora Bei\nBurt Humburg\nClinger-Hamilton Family\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nDeliciousKashmiri\nDustin\nEric Meer\nKaren Haskell\nKen Board\nMehdi Damou\nRobert Young\nRoy Lasris\nSalih Arslan\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/",

Being able to predict these rapidly intensifying storms will save lives, but studying hurricanes in detail is difficult and dangerous. So in order to improve our understanding of hurricanes, scientists have built a machine that can create hurricane conditions indoors. #weather #hurricanes \n\nFilmed at the Alfred C.

It\u2019s a seemingly simple question with a surprisingly complex answer. We\u2019ll be hanging out with some jumping spiders (the cutest of all spiders) and some jumping spider researchers to investigate how a thumbnail-sized creature with a poppy seed-sized brain ended up evolving some of the most advanced eyes in the animal kingdom, overcoming a few limitations of physics in the process. We\u2019ll watch as scientists study these spiders in a special eye tracking machine and learn how having 8 eyes instead of two gives these elite predators almost 360\u02da vision and almost hawk-level depth perception and resolution.\n\nReferences: https://sites.google.com/view/how-jumping-spiders-see/home\n\nBig thanks to:\nDr. Beth Jakob and Alex Winsor - UMass Amherst http://ejakob.popslice.com/\nDr. Nathan Morehouse and lab - University of Cincinnati https://homepages.uc.edu/~morehonn/\n\nAdditional footage credits:\nSpider retinal movements - Daniel Zurek\nSpider courtship videos - Daniel Zurek, Sebastian Echeverri, and Nathan Morehouse (Morehouse Lab, University of Cincinnati)\n\n-----------\n\nHigh fives to all our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nNullBlox.ZachryWilsn\npaul andre bouis\nMark Littlehale\nAli Freiburger\nMehdi Damou\nBarbora Bei\nKen Board\nAttila Pix\nBurt Humburg\nRoy Lasris\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nSalih Arslan\nBaerbel Winkler\nRobert Young\nEric Meer\nDustin\nKaren Haskell\n\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nTwitter \nhttp://www.twitter.com/DrJoeHanson\nhttp://www.twitter.com/okaytobesmart \n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart\n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/",

If you had the chance to see it, you're surely glad you didn't miss it. It\u2019s an amazing coincidence that total eclipses happen at all \u2014 and that we\u2019re alive at a time when we can see and predict them. We made this video so you can learn how to watch an eclipse safely, what to look for during an eclipse, why eclipses happen, and how eclipses have helped advance scientific research.\n\nExplore this April 8, 2024 eclipse map from NASA! https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/where-when/\n\nFind your next solar eclipse here: https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEatlas/SEatlas.html\n\nLearn more about the solar eclipse timer app: https://www.solareclipsetimer.com/\n \n-----------\n\nHigh fives to all our Brain Trust Patrons:\n\nEd Eyden\nJennifer Burton\nCharles Horton, Jr\nHolly, Brett, and Ashe Bullion\nJaap Westera\nMehdi Damou\nBarbora Bei\nBurt Humburg\ndani bowman\nDavid Johnston\nBaerbel Winkler\nEric Meer\nKaren Haskell\n\nJoin us on Patreon! \nhttps://patreon.com/itsokaytobesmart\n\nInstagram \nhttp://www.instagram.com/DrJoeHanson \nhttp://www.instagram.com/okaytobesmart \n\nFacebook\nhttps://www.facebook.com/itsokaytobesmartpbs/\n\nMerch\nhttps://store.dftba.com/collections/its-okay-to-be-smart",
