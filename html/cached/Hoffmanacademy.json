Watch as Joseph Hoffman teaches a simplified, Early Elementary arrangement of Ludwig van Beethoven's timeless classic, F\u00fcr Elise. \n\nThe great Ludwig van Beethoven composed \"F\u00fcr Elise\" a little over 200 years ago in Vienna, Austria, and then dedicated the piece to a mysterious woman named Elise. In German, \u201cf\u00fcr Elise\u201d means \u201cfor Elise\u201d.\n\nWho was this woman named Elise? No one knows, but as you listen to \"F\u00fcr Elise\" you can get some hints about how Beethoven felt about her. By the end of this video, you will be playing a version of this beloved classical piano piece, which is one of the most famous of all time. \n\nBy the way, this \"F\u00fcr Elise\" tutorial you are watching is the super easy preparatory level tutorial, which is perfect for anyone with zero to six months of piano playing experience.\n\nI highly recommend that you get the accompanying sheet music for this tutorial to help you learn how to play F\u00fcr Elise on piano. This sheet music is available for purchase online at the Hoffman Academy's store.\n\nIf you're a Premium Member of Hoffman Academy, then the sheet music is free and included with your Premium Membership.\n\nIf you're a more experienced pianist and you'd like harder versions of \"F\u00fcr Elise\", you can also check out my level 1, level 4, or level 6 tutorials. \n\n\ud83c\udfb9 All of these tutorials and more information on Ludwig van Beethoven\u2019s \"F\u00fcr Elise\" can be found at the Hoffman Academy website.\n\nLet's get to the piano to begin practicing this historic piece.

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

      "description": "How Long Does it Take to Learn Piano? https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/h...\nA lot of people ask how long it takes to learn to play the piano. Maybe you have a certain song in mind, and you want to know how long before you can play it. Maybe you\u2019re starting lessons and wondering where it ends. Or maybe you want to know how long before you can accompany yourself while you sing, or play with a band, or play hymns in church. The real answer to \u201cHow long does it take to learn to play the piano?\u201d is: It depends! Let\u2019s explore the possibilities.\n\nFirst of all, the amount of time it takes to learn to play the piano depends on what level of playing you want to achieve. A person with no experience can learn to play the melody of a short song in minutes. For instance, if you want to play \u201cHot Cross Buns\u201d you can watch the first Hoffman Academy lesson and master this simple song right away, without any prior training. On the other hand, let\u2019s say you want to become a world-class classical pianist, and perform crazy-advanced pieces like Rachmaninoff\u2019s Piano Concerto #3. In that case, you\u2019re looking at a minimum of 10 to 15 years of concentrated study with a master teacher, and hours per day of practice.\n\nMost people who want to learn the piano aim for something in between these two extremes. Whatever level you\u2019re hoping to achieve, your progress will most of all depend on how diligently and effectively you practice. Other important factors include your teacher, how motivated you are, and your individual learning pace.\n\nLevel 6: Your artistic expression continues to develop. Your fingers are comfortable with frequent wider reaches, and you can play four-note chords. You can learn to play most popular music and movie themes, like the theme from \u201cMission Impossible.\"\n\nGet more piano lessons & materials at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com\nJoin our Facebook community: https://www.facebook.com/HoffmanAcademy/\nNeed a piano?

      "description": "How Long Does it Take to Learn Piano? https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/h...\nA lot of people ask how long it takes to learn to play the piano. Maybe you have a certain song in mind, and you want to know how long before you can play it. Maybe you\u2019re starting lessons and wondering where it ends. Or maybe you want to know how long before you can accompany yourself while you sing, or play with a band, or play hymns in church. The real answer to \u201cHow long does it take to learn to play the piano?\u201d is: It depends! Let\u2019s explore the possibilities.\n\nFirst of all, the amount of time it takes to learn to play the piano depends on what level of playing you want to achieve. A person with no experience can learn to play the melody of a short song in minutes. For instance, if you want to play \u201cHot Cross Buns\u201d you can watch the first Hoffman Academy lesson and master this simple song right away, without any prior training. On the other hand, let\u2019s say you want to become a world-class classical pianist, and perform crazy-advanced pieces like Rachmaninoff\u2019s Piano Concerto #3. In that case, you\u2019re looking at a minimum of 10 to 15 years of concentrated study with a master teacher, and hours per day of practice.\n\nMost people who want to learn the piano aim for something in between these two extremes. Whatever level you\u2019re hoping to achieve, your progress will most of all depend on how diligently and effectively you practice. Other important factors include your teacher, how motivated you are, and your individual learning pace.\n\nLevel 4: You can play songs that include an octave reach, arpeggios, and constant hand-shifting, such as the lyrical opening section of Beethoven\u2019s \u201cF\u00fcr Elise.\u201d\n\nFind piano lessons & materials at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com\nJoin our Facebook community: https://www.facebook.com/HoffmanAcademy/\nNeed a piano?

Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

      "description": "How Long Does it Take to Learn Piano? https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/how-long-will-it-take-to-learn-the-piano/\nA lot of people ask how long it takes to learn to play the piano. Maybe you have a certain song in mind, and you want to know how long before you can play it. Maybe you\u2019re starting lessons and wondering where it ends. Or maybe you want to know how long before you can accompany yourself while you sing, or play with a band, or play hymns in church. The real answer to \u201cHow long does it take to learn to play the piano?\u201d is: It depends! Let\u2019s explore the possibilities.\n\nFirst of all, the amount of time it takes to learn to play the piano depends on what level of playing you want to achieve. A person with no experience can learn to play the melody of a short song in minutes. For instance, if you want to play \u201cHot Cross Buns\u201d you can watch the first Hoffman Academy lesson and master this simple song right away, without any prior training. On the other hand, let\u2019s say you want to become a world-class classical pianist, and perform crazy-advanced pieces like Rachmaninoff\u2019s Piano Concerto #3. In that case, you\u2019re looking at a minimum of 10 to 15 years of concentrated study with a master teacher, and hours per day of practice.\n\nMost people who want to learn the piano aim for something in between these two extremes. Whatever level you\u2019re hoping to achieve, your progress will most of all depend on how diligently and effectively you practice. Other important factors include your teacher, how motivated you are, and your individual learning pace.\n\nLevel 1B: You can play songs that require more hand shifting, and you\u2019ve learned to cross over and under with your fingers. Many simplified versions of pop songs are within your ability, as you\u2019ll find if you give our Katy Parry \u201cFirework\u201d tutorial a try.\n\nGet more piano lessons & materials at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com\nJoin our Facebook community: https://www.facebook.com/HoffmanAcademy/\nNeed a piano?

      "description": "How Long Does it Take to Learn Piano? https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/how-long-will-it-take-to-learn-the-piano/\nA lot of people ask how long it takes to learn to play the piano. Maybe you have a certain song in mind, and you want to know how long before you can play it. Maybe you\u2019re starting lessons and wondering where it ends. Or maybe you want to know how long before you can accompany yourself while you sing, or play with a band, or play hymns in church. The real answer to \u201cHow long does it take to learn to play the piano?\u201d is: It depends! Let\u2019s explore the possibilities.\n\nFirst of all, the amount of time it takes to learn to play the piano depends on what level of playing you want to achieve. A person with no experience can learn to play the melody of a short song in minutes. For instance, if you want to play \u201cHot Cross Buns\u201d you can watch the first Hoffman Academy lesson and master this simple song right away, without any prior training. On the other hand, let\u2019s say you want to become a world-class classical pianist, and perform crazy-advanced pieces like Rachmaninoff\u2019s Piano Concerto #3. In that case, you\u2019re looking at a minimum of 10 to 15 years of concentrated study with a master teacher, and hours per day of practice.\n\nMost people who want to learn the piano aim for something in between these two extremes. Whatever level you\u2019re hoping to achieve, your progress will most of all depend on how diligently and effectively you practice. Other important factors include your teacher, how motivated you are, and your individual learning pace.\n\nPreparatory A: At this point, you\u2019re starting to add simple two-note chords, and can play a wider range of melodies, like this simplified version of \"Linus & Lucy.\"\n\nGet piano lessons & materials at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com\nJoin our Facebook community: https://www.facebook.com/HoffmanAcademy/\nNeed a piano?

Hoffman Academy teacher, Stephanie, gives you a quick overview of the music education tool that helps musicians and music students learn pitch, intervals, transposition and more.\n\nSolf\u00e8ge is a great tool for learning music, for sight-reading, and for understanding music theory. It\u2019s been part of the language of music for many centuries. \n\nSolf\u00e8ge gives us a way to name patterns in music, talk about them, and get to know them. That way when we see them on the page we know how they should sound, and when we hear them in music we know how they\u2019ll look on the page.",

      "description": "\ud83c\udfb9 Find the complete print & audio materials for Unit 12 at: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/store/sheet-music/hoffman-method-for-piano-unit-12\n\nDownload our free guide to learn all piano scales: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/piano-scales/\nLearn more about the C minor piano scale, including chords and songs in this key, at the Hoffman Academy website: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/piano-chords-in-c-minor/\n\nIn this lesson, we're going to learn how to play a two-octave C minor piano scale and an arpeggio in C minor. \n\nIf you\u2019ve been taking our online piano lessons, you know that C major is our major scale with zero sharps and flats. Can you tell me what minor key also has zero sharps and flats? If you said A minor, you're correct. To find the relative minor, it's always just a skip of a third below.\n\nSo A natural minor also has zero sharps and flats just like C major. Now today, we're going to be going up even further on the ladder of fourths. We can use the minor scales just like the major scales to go up fourths and add flats. So if A minor has zero sharps and flats, we can go up a fourth to D.\n\nD minor has one flat. Now if we go up another fourth from D, which note would we be on? So G minor should have two flats. Remember, every time we go up a fourth we add a flat. So we have a B-flat and an E-flat now in G natural minor.\n\nWhat if we want to go up another fourth? Where would that bring us? What's a fourth above G? If you said C, you're correct, and I'm going to come down to this C, and based on our law of the ladder of fourths how many flats should we now have in C minor? If you said three, you're correct. We're now up to three flats.\n\nLet's take a look at our ladder of fourths. You can see if we're looking on the minor side we went up a fourth from A to D, to G to C, and now that we're in the C minor scale, we have three flats: B-flat, E-flat, and A-flat.\n\n\u2728Watch this lesson & hundreds more in order & ad-free at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/lessons! \u2728\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ad-Free Online Piano Lessons for Kids & Beginners with Hoffman Academy! \ud83c\udfb5\nWatch our 350+ FREE piano lessons at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com - no ads, just music!

Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

He's the king of ragtime!\n\nJoplin was an African-American composer and pianist, partially responsible for beginning a new era of music called \u201cragtime\u201d. His most famous piece, Maple Leaf Rag, was released in 1899 and it was one of the first he published.\n\nMaple Leaf Rag, along with many others, began ragtime. Ragtime was a new style of music with lots of syncopation, or emphasis, on the offbeats. Ragtime music had big energy and was fun to dance to. Ragtime would later spark the beginning of swing music, which evolved into jazz.",

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

Knowing the sonata-allegro form will help you understand how these sonatas are built.\n\nWhat is a sonatina? A sonatina is simply a short sonata.  Sonatinas and sonatas both generally have three movements, a fast movement, a slow movement, then a fast movement.\n\n\u2728Watch this lesson & hundreds more in order & ad-free at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/lessons! \u2728\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ad-Free Online Piano Lessons for Kids & Beginners with Hoffman Academy! \ud83c\udfb5\nWatch our 350+ FREE piano lessons at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com - no ads, just music!

      "description": "\ud83c\udfb9 Learn more about dynamics in music at the Hoffman Academy website: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/all-about-dynamics/\n\nToday we're learning about dynamics in music. To help understand the power and excitement of dynamics, we're going to be getting lots of help from Mr. Ludwig van Beethoven and his wonderful nine symphonies. For starters, let's listen to some of the second movement of \"Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\"\n\nDynamics are the louds and the softs in music, and everything in between. On the softest, quietest end of the spectrum is pianissimo. Pianissimo means very soft. One small notch louder is piano. Piano means soft. Next comes mezzo piano, which means medium soft. If we go a little louder we get to mezzo forte, and then forte. Forte means strong and loud. Finally, we get to fortissimo which means very strong and loud.\n\nYou can think of progressing up each dynamic level as if you're going up steps on a staircase, but there's another way you can increase volume more smoothly and gradually using what's called a crescendo. A crescendo means to smoothly and gradually grow louder.\n\n\u2728Watch this lesson & hundreds more in order & ad-free at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/lessons! \u2728\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ad-Free Online Piano Lessons for Kids & Beginners with Hoffman Academy! \ud83c\udfb5\nWatch our 350+ FREE piano lessons at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com - no ads, just music!

      "description": "\ud83c\udfb9 Learn more about tempo in music at the Hoffman Academy website: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/what-is-tempo-in-music/\n\nToday we're learning about tempo indications. A tempo indication is a musical term often in Italian, which always appears at the top of your piece telling you how fast or slow to play. A tempo indication can also tell you about the mood of the piece. \n\nLet's learn more about tempo indications by listening to examples of music from some great composers.\n\nOne of the trickiest jobs a composer has is to take all the musical sounds in her or his head and turn them into symbols on a piece of paper that another musician can pick up, and then recreate those sounds the composer originally had in mind.\n\nThe first piece we listen to in this video is by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Mozart wrote the word \u201candante\u201d at the top of the score to let the performers know to play it at a peaceful relaxed tempo.\n\nAndante means slow, but not too slow. Andante feels relaxed, but it still has movement. Perhaps like a walk along the beach, taking your time, but still going somewhere.\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Find the complete print & audio materials for Unit 7 at: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/store/sheet-music/hoffman-method-for-piano-unit-7\n\n\u2728Watch this lesson & hundreds more in order & ad-free at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/lessons! \u2728\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ad-Free Online Piano Lessons for Kids & Beginners with Hoffman Academy! \ud83c\udfb5\nWatch our 350+ FREE piano lessons at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com - no ads, just music!

Good, let's come to the grand staff.\n\nBefore we take the challenge, let's review what an interval is. An interval is the distance between two notes on the staff or on the piano keys.\n\nTo measure an interval, we count starting from the first note. In the video, we go from the first note to the second note. So this interval would be a second, and it's the same for the staff. \n\nNotice that when we're playing the piano interval of a second we're going from a line to a space note. When it's a third, we'll always go from a line to a line, or it's also possible to go from a space to a space to be the interval of a third.\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Find the complete print & audio materials for Unit 7 at: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/store/sheet-music/hoffman-method-for-piano-unit-7\n\n\u2728Watch this lesson & hundreds more in order & ad-free at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/lessons! \u2728\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ad-Free Online Piano Lessons for Kids & Beginners with Hoffman Academy! \ud83c\udfb5\nWatch our 350+ FREE piano lessons at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com - no ads, just music!

'Tri-' as a prefix means \u201cthree\u201d. Think triangle, tricycle, or adenosine triphosphate, which your body would definitely be using to ride a tricycle.\n\nSo remember, a triad is a group of three notes in a chord. Let's come to the piano and get ready to play some triads. \n\nLet's consider figuring out a major piano triad. In C major it's easy, right? All white keys: C E G. One way to figure out a triad is just by remembering the pentascale. If I say give me a C major triad, you can use the C major pentascale, and then just skip instead of stepping through the pentascale. That builds the major piano triads.\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Find the complete print & audio materials for Unit 7 at: https://www.hoffmanacademy.com/store/sheet-music/hoffman-method-for-piano-unit-7\n\n\u2728Watch this lesson & hundreds more in order & ad-free at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/lessons! \u2728\n\n\ud83c\udfb5 Ad-Free Online Piano Lessons for Kids & Beginners with Hoffman Academy! \ud83c\udfb5\nWatch our 350+ FREE piano lessons at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com - no ads, just music!

As you\u2019re sight reading, try to not just look at the notes and rhythms but also try and incorporate the dynamics too.\n\nIf you spend a lot of time practicing sight reading, you will be able to open up almost any piece of music and play it on your first try if it's not too hard. And that's why I encourage you to practice your sight reading skills every day.\n\n#HoffmanAcademy #PianoTutorial #OnlinePianoLessons #SightReading",

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner\n\n#HoffmanAcademy #PianoTutorial #OnlinePianoLessons #LearnPiano #PianoLessons",

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",

      "description": "\ud83c\udfb9 Learn even more about bass clef notes on staff at the Hoffman Academy website:\nhttps://www.hoffmanacademy.com/blog/how-to-read-bass-clef-notes/\n\nIs reading bass clef notes on staff difficult for you? Mr. Hoffman has some easy tips to help you master sight reading notes in the bass clef for piano playing. \n\nWhat is a bass clef? The bass clef is the symbol musicians use whenever they need to write low notes. Cellists and tubaists read bass clef notes, and pianists read bass clef for the notes played by the left hand.\n\nThe bass clef isn't just to tell you that the notes will be low. It's specifically placed on the five-line staff to show where the F line is. You see, the bass clef is actually a very old-fashioned way to draw the letter F. \n\nYou could also try remembering a trick I tell my younger students: the bass clef is a frowny face which stands for F. So simply look for the line between the two eyes of mister frowny face and any note on that line is an F. Also, this is not just any F. This F is called \u201cbass F\u201d and it\u2019s the F just below middle C on the piano. From there you can figure out any other note in the bass clef by simply following the musical alphabet. \n\nIf you train yourself to recognize the bass clef guide notes, then you can easily figure out any other note. The good news is that you've already learned your first guide note: bass F.\n\nHappy Practicing!\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Learn more about notes on the bass clef at the Hoffman Academy website.\n\n #HoffmanAcademy #PianoTutorial #OnlinePianoLessons #BassClef #PianoNotes",

This hit song is from Disney's Encanto and was composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda. \n\nThis is not Lin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s first time composing music for Disney films. In fact, he wrote songs for Disney\u2019s Moana while he was writing his hit musical \u201cHamilton\u201d. Encanto is Miranda\u2019s latest animated musical with Disney, and he says he never expected \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno\u201d to be such a huge success.\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda\u2019s children were the first ones to notice the catchiness of this tune. They overheard him composing it at home and were always singing it around the house. Miranda had to tell them they weren\u2019t allowed to sing it at school until after the movie was released. Now, everyone is singing it!\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Learning how to play \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno\u201d on piano\n\nTo begin playing this popular song on the piano, let's first find our position. Our right hand is going to have finger 1 here on middle C, so go ahead and find this on your piano.\n\nBy the way, the notes taught in this piano tutorial are in the same key as the original version so you can even play along with the movie soundtrack using these exact notes, and it should sound great.\n\nThis video tutorial for how to play \u201cWe Don\u2019t Talk About Bruno\u201d on piano includes short excerpts from the longer song. You\u2019ll be learning the parts that are the most fun and easiest to play on the piano. You can then combine these short excerpts while playing with the original track.\n\n#HoffmanAcademy #PianoTutorial #OnlinePianoLessons #Encanto #LinManuelMiranda #Disney #PianoLessons #Music #Theory #PianoLearning #LearnPiano",

Remember, for major keys we start with C major and then go up fifths. Every time we go up a fifth we add a sharp. \n\nThis is the same for the minor ladder of fifths, but the minor ladder of fifths begins on A minor with zero sharps. If we go up a fifth to E minor we get one sharp. Then we go up another fifth to B minor.\n\nIn B minor we have two sharps, which are F sharp and C sharp. What is the relative major of B minor? A relative key means the same key signature, so the relative major of B minor is D major because they both have the same key signature, including both F sharp and C sharp.\n\n\ud83c\udfb9 Watch the video above to begin playing the B minor piano scale with both hands.

      "description": "One of the biggest obstacles to learning piano at a young age is that although lots of kids love music, they tend to hate piano lessons. Fortunately, the problem is simply the old-fashioned way the piano is taught and not the piano itself.\n\nHi, I'm Joseph Hoffman. Through two decades of research, experimenting, and lots of real-life testing with hundreds of students, I developed a new method for teaching piano that works.\nThe Hoffman Method taps into a child's natural curiosity and uses experience and exploration to develop complete fluency and musical skills. We see this method inspire students to reach their full musical potential every day. \n\nSadly, so many people can't afford private piano lessons. That\u2019s why I decided to use my method to create a series of online piano lessons. We have over 350 video lessons so far, with more being added often.\n\nExperience hundreds of piano lessons that are carefully designed by a trained professional pianist and teacher. Anyone anywhere can learn to play the piano with our fun lessons. Sign up for an account today at https://www.HoffmanAcademy.com/.\n\n #HoffmanAcademy #PianoTutorials #OnlinePianoLessons",

Many people have unused pianos they'd love to pass on to a beginner \u2014 maybe even for free! Factor in moving and tuning costs. These can add up, but you're still saving big.\n\nPro tip: Bring a piano tuner or teacher to inspect. Watch for cracks, worn hammers, or missing keys. A well-maintained used piano can sound amazing without the hefty price tag. \n\nBe cautious and avoid scams. Always inspect in person!\n\nVisit HoffmanAcademy.com for more tips and to start our FREE online lessons today! \ud83c\udfb5\n\n#PianoBuyingTips #HoffmanAcademy #LearnPiano #UsedPianos #BeginnerMusician #Piano #TeachPiano #HoffmanMethod #Yamaha #Music #STEAMEducation #STEAM #MomHack #DadHack #Frugal #PianoLessons",

Our library grew with tons of new sheet music arrangements, while our blog explored topics from Clara Schumann to music theory fundamentals.\n\nWe created colorful new worksheets and our back-to-school collection (hello, Dynamic Bus and Piano Note Pencils! \u270f\ufe0f). Summer piano camps brought musical adventure to students worldwide \ud83c\udfd5\ufe0f, Monkey helped Santa navigate his sleigh in our holiday finger puppet shows \ud83d\udc12\ud83c\udf85, and we even published our first printed books!\n\nThe best part? We're just getting started. Coming soon: our new student dashboard and \"Sea Turtle Shuffle\" game that promise to make learning piano more fun than ever! \ud83d\udc22\n\nHead to our blog to explore everything from 2024. Thank you to every student, parent, and teacher in our musical community - you inspire us every day to keep creating, innovating, and making piano education accessible to all. \u2728\n\n#HoffmanAcademy #PianoLessons #MusicEducation #Bestof2024 #2024SeasonComestoanEnd #LearnPiano #Piano #OnlinePianoLessons",

I am not just taught about music theory and techniques but left without a use for them. At the same time, I am also not just taught how to play songs with no theory or explanation. Instead, I learn theory, techniques, songs, and more together in a way that combines everything and allows me to put the theory into practice.\"\n- Adult Learner",
