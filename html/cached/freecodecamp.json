      "description": "On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews prolific programming teacher John Smilga. John grew up in the Soviet Union. He worked construction for 5 years before becoming a developer. Today he has taught millions of fellow devs through his many courses on freeCodeCamp.\n\nJohn spent his childhood in Latvia before the Soviet Union fell. He sought work in the UK as an expat hospitality worker on the tiny island of Guernsey.\n\nBut he had his sights set on moving to the US. There he worked construction and taught himself to code. He also attended online university courses to get a degree.\n\nHe met his wife, a nurse from Ukraine. Together they started a family and live together in Florida.\n\nDuring this conversation, John talks about his journey into teaching the programming and computer science concepts he's learned. He talks about his free courses on freeCodeCamp and his paid courses that help him pay the bills.\n\nJohn's voice is instantly recognizable by developers. He shares that this is because he has condition where is vocal cords are partially paralyzed, for which he has to receive frequent injections.\n\nI hope you enjoy our conversation.\n\nCan you guess what bass line I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1982 song produced by Quincy Jones.\n\nBe sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,003 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.

I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails.\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1995s Nintendo game.\n\nBe sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,331 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.

      "description": "On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews The Primeagean. He's a software engineer who streams himself programming. He recently left his job at Netflix to stream full-time.\n\nWe talk about:\n- Prime's journey from his teacher telling him he'll never accomplish anything in life to working as an engineer at one of the most prestigious tech companies.\n- Prime's love of \"Nintendo Hard\" video games, and how his love of challenge propelled him to \"get good\" at coding\n- What it's like to live stream coding in front of more than 1,000 people for a dozen hours each week\n- Leaving San Francisco to move his family of 6 to a horse ranch in South Dakota\n- Prime's thoughts on AI and how he thinks it will actually create more developer jobs than it destroys\n\nI had a blast talking with this guy. Though I don't agree with everything he says, I am right there with him on AI and how it's useful but over-hyped. We'll see what future versions hold and whether a \"Moore's Law of AI\" is really at work here, or whether it will plateau.\n\nI also agree with Prime that devs need to slow down and improve their foundational skills. There are no shortcuts to anywhere worth going.\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 1996 rock song.\n\nBe sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,331 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.

      "description": "On this week's episode of the podcast, freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Jerod Santo, host of The Changelog, a podcast about open source software development that has been going strong for 15 years.\n\nJerod is plugged in to the world of Open Source, going to all the big conferences and interviewing all the big open source creators. \n\nWe have a fun, wide-reaching conversation about some of the current issues facing open source, such as AI models and Relicensing \u2013 essentially, a big company closed-sourcing a previously open source project after they buy out its creator. (Fun fact: this can't happen to freeCodeCamp because charities cannot be bought or sold.)\n\nI ask Jerod about:\n\n- his life as a remote dev in Omaha, Nebraska, raising his 6 his kids\n- the Changelog News podcast with its weekly 10 minutes of updates on the world of open source\n- his process, and how he researches and surfaces interesting news for his show\n- and how The Changelog commissioned 3 full albums worth of music over the years, which you can stream for free.\n\nCan you guess what bass line I'm playing during the intro? It's from a 1984 pop classic.\n\nBe sure to follow The freeCodeCamp podcast in your favorite podcast app. And share this podcast with a friend. Let's inspire more folks to learn to code and build careers for themselves in tech.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,331 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible. You can join them and support our mission at: https://www.freecodecamp.org/donate\n\nLinks we talk about during our conversation:\n\n- Jerod's weekly Changelog News podcast that you should totally subscribe to (it's free): https://changelog.com/news\n\n- Jerod and Adam interview the head of the Open Source Initiative on AI models and open source, which he and I discussed during this podcast: https://changelog.com/podcast/578\n\n- Changelog Beats: https://changelog.com/beats\n\n- And of course, my interview with Jerod and Adam about their developer journeys, and the history of The Changelog on its 10th anniversary: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/open-source-moves-fast-10-years-of-the-changelog/ \n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive learning: https://scrimba.com/freecodecamp",

Created in collaboration between Mistral AI and Scrimba.\n\nCode is available on the Scrimba course page for each lesson. You will learn how to build intelligent applications that span from straightforward chat completions to complex functionalities like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling.\n\nStarting off, you\u2019ll get an introduction to Mistral's open-source models, including Mistral 7B and Mistral 8x7B, and progress to their commercial models. You'll gain hands-on experience leveraging the full suite of Mistral\u2019s La Plateforme. \n\nThe rest of the course is mainly focused on two essential paradigms in AI engineering: knowledge retrieval and AI agents. In the first part, you\u2019ll learn how to split text documents with LangChain, convert them into embeddings, store them in a vector database, and finally perform retrieval.\nIn the AI agents segment, you\u2019ll learn how to give Mistral access to the functions within your app, and let their models decide when to call them. This skill will enable you to create a whole new type of user experience, where people can interact with your apps through conversation instead of mere clicking.\n\nTowards the end, we will also go through how you can use Ollama to easily run inference on your own computer, and use it as the backbone of any AI app you develop locally.\n\nCreated by Per Borgen from Scrimba. https://www.youtube.com/c/Scrimba\n\n\u2764\ufe0f Try interactive AI courses we love, right in your browser: https://scrimba.com/freeCodeCamp-AI (Made possible by a grant from our friends at Scrimba)\n\n\u2b50\ufe0f Contents \u2b50\ufe0f\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:00:00) Welcome to the course\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:02:36) Intro to Mistral by Sophia Yang\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:05:41) Sign up for La Plateforme\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:07:08) Mistral's Chat Completion API\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:11:19) Mistral's Chat Completion API - part 2\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:15:20) Mistral's models\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:19:54) What is RAG?\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:24:19) What are embeddings?\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:30:35) RAG - Chunking text with LangChain\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:35:27) RAG - Completing the splitDocument function\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:37:20) RAG - Creating our very first embedding\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:39:51) RAG - Challenge: embedding all chunks and preparing it for the vector db\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:44:34) Set up your vector database\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:47:27) Vector databases\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:47:51) RAG - Uploading data to the vector db\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:50:36) RAG - Query and Create completion\n\u2328\ufe0f (0:55:30) RAG - Improve the retrieval and complete the generation\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:00:26) Function calling\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:05:46) Function calling - Adding a second function\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:08:11) Function calling - Unpacking the function and arguments\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:12:00) Function calling - Making the call\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:13:49) Function calling - Updating the messages array\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:15:49) Function calling - Creating the loop\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:18:41) Running Mistral locally\n\u2328\ufe0f (1:22:39) Outro & recap - Mistral AI\n\nCorrection:\n16:43 Upon running this calculation through a state-of-the art calculator and cross referencing with advanced AI, we determined that 8 times 7 is actually 56.\n\n\n\ud83c\udf89 Thanks to our Champion and Sponsor supporters:\n\ud83d\udc7e davthecoder\n\ud83d\udc7e jedi-or-sith\n\ud83d\udc7e \u5357\u5bae\u5343\u5f71\n\ud83d\udc7e Agust\u00edn Kussrow\n\ud83d\udc7e Nattira Maneerat\n\ud83d\udc7e Heather Wcislo\n\ud83d\udc7e Serhiy Kalinets\n\ud83d\udc7e Justin Hual\n\ud83d\udc7e Otis Morgan \n\ud83d\udc7e Oscar Rahnama\n\n--\n\nLearn to code for free and get a developer job: https://www.freecodecamp.org\n\nRead hundreds of articles on programming: https://freecodecamp.org/news",

He's a Machine Learning Engineer and creator of many popular tutorials on YouTube. He's also a frequent freeCodeCamp contributor.\n\nWe talk about:\n\n- How as a kid he hacked into his school's network and gave himself good grades, just like the kid from Wargames. (Don't try this at home.)\n\n- What he learned from helping fix 5,000 people's computers\n\n- How Machine Learning actually works. What the AI models are actually doing for you in the background.\n\n- His advice for anyone getting into Machine Learning in 2024, in terms of what to prioritize learning\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing on my bass during the intro? It's from a 2020 song by an Australian musician.\n\nAlso, I want to thank the 9,779 kind people who support our charity each month, and who make this podcast possible.

He's a software engineer who also runs a local chain of coffee shops in Knoxville. Eamonn taught himself to code using freeCodeCamp.

Join these kind folks and get involved in our mission by going to donate.freecodecamp.org\n\nWe talk about:\n- Eamonn's love of coffee and how he bought VHS tapes to learn latte art\n- How he finds time to expand his skills in between running coffee shops and ultra-marathoning\n- How he used spreadsheets to automate the logistics of running coffee shops\n- How he balances being a musician and writer with the practical realities of providing for a family of 6\n\nCORRECTION: Vincent van Gogh was supported by his younger brother \u2013 not his brother in-law. van Gogh never married so he never had a brother in law. I'm not sure why I thought that. Also, he seems to have sold more than one painting in his life (as many of us were taught in school), but nowhere near enough paintings to support himself as an artist.\n\nCan you guess what song I'm playing in the intro?\n\nLinks we talk about during our conversation:\n\nEamonn's freeCodeCamp articles: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/author/sieis/\n\nEamonn's YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@EamonnCottrell\n\nExcel-based esports: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N2QC6VQXo8U\n\nUltra Marathons: https://www.youtube.com/@runtired\n\nGot Sheet: https://www.gotsheet.xyz/\n\nProgress and Perfection: https://www.progressandperfection.com/\n\nEamonn on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eamonncottrell/\n\nEamonn on Twitter: https://x.com/EamonnCottrell\n\nChapters\n0:00:00 Introduction to Eamonn Cottrell\n0:03:35 Eamonn's Diverse Pursuits\n0:05:39 The Ultra Marathon Journey\n0:10:59 Training and Daily Routine\n0:20:33 Family Life and Parenting\n0:24:55 Overcoming Addiction and Recovery\n0:30:24 The Journey of Recovery and Community Integration\n0:33:42 Embracing Regrets and Learning from Mistakes\n0:37:14 Education and Career Progression\n0:45:48 Life as a Barista: Craftsmanship and Community\n0:52:34 Mastering Latte Art: A Blend of Skill and Passion\n0:55:57 From Barista to COO: A Career Transformation\n1:02:14 The Power of Automation in Business Operations\n1:10:03 Personal Finance Management through Spreadsheets\n1:12:38 Navigating Financial Realities\n1:14:08 The Art of Budgeting and Planning\n1:14:57 Creating and Sharing Knowledge\n1:16:21 The Intersection of Creativity and Productivity\n1:19:56 The Journey of a Creative Mind\n1:22:24 Balancing Creativity with Practicality\n1:25:15 Documenting Your Journey\n1:28:49 Future Aspirations and Family Life\n1:31:49 The Balance of Work and Creativity\n1:33:40 The Impact of Parenthood on Productivity\n1:36:55 Lessons from Gaming and Life\n1:41:36 Final Thoughts and Resources \n\n\u2764\ufe0f Support for this channel comes from our friends at Scrimba \u2013 the coding platform that's reinvented interactive learning: https://scrimba.com/freecodecamp",
