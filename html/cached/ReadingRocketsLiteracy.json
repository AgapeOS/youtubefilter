      "description": "At An Unlikely Story bookstore in Plainville, MA, Gene sits down for a lively conversation with Wimpy Kid author (and bookstore owner) Jeff Kinney.\n\nAs a kid, Kinney was a prankster and a devoted reader of his sister's Judy Blume books. He later discovered fantasy (The Hobbitt, The Lord of the Rings, and the Xanth series), comics (The Far Side, Calvin and Hobbes), and the genius of Carl Barks (Donald Duck comics).\n\nKinney talks about how his early dream of being a newspaper comic strip writer led to the creation of Greg Heffley and his middle school world. Listen in as Kinney shares some sage advice with young people who want to be cartoonists \u2014 and why cartooning is the art of simplification.",

      "description": "Reading expert Linda Farrell shows Xavier how to read and spell unfamiliar multisyllable words with one vowel letter in each syllable. First she makes sure that Xavier has three prerequisite skills: being able to read one-syllable nonsense words, knowing how to count syllables in spoken words, and naming the vowel letters. Xavier learns that every syllable has a vowel, and that he can count the vowel letters to break a long word into syllables to make it easy to read. To figure out how many syllables are in a word, Ms. Farrell teaches Xavier to ask two questions: How many vowels are in the word? Are the vowels together or apart?\n\nThis video is part of the reading Rockets special series, Looking at Reading Interventions.

      "description": "How can a parent help his child who has a lot of a great ideas but trouble organizing them? Writing expert William Van Cleave suggests a few pre-writing steps to help children organize their ideas. First, it may help for parents to write the ideas down so that handwriting and spelling aren\u2019t the focus, especially for young children. In addition, it may help to make a list of the ideas that can be cut up so the pieces can be moved around. With some pre-writing planning and organization in place, the ideas will flow more smoothly once the writing begins.\n\nThis video is part of our special series, Writing SOS, where parents ask the experts their questions about writing and how to support their kids at home.
