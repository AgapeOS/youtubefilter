      "description": "Blue is obessed with his hero, Captain Spanner, and has a poster on the wall. As Fiona Fire Truck comes in for some routine repairs, but Blue is more interested in playing superhero with his little cape. However, when something goes wrong - the car jack backfires and Red ends up catapulted up onto a high pylon - they need to act to rescue him. Fiona's ladder isn't tall enough, but then Gecko has the idea to  catapult Blue up to get Red, turning his superhero cape into a glider so they can land safely. Thus, Blue gets to play superhero and. just briefly, fly just like Captain Spanner!\n\nLove Gecko's Garage and Toddler Fun Learning?

      "description": "A storm is brewing as Gecko fixes Mummy Truck's flat tyre by the side of the road after the wind blew a fence into the road and gave her a puncture while she was out with Baby Truck... once the job is done Gecko puts the fence posts into the back of Tilly to save another vehicle from the same fate. Suddenly a flash of lightning startles poor Baby Truck who drives into the trees for cover... Gecko and Mummy follow but are unable to find her and the storm is getting worse, so Gecko presses the emergency button in Tilly to alert Kat who soon arrives on scene. Using the radio in Tilly they communicate as Kat uses her aerial advantage and expert tracking skills to pick up Baby Truck's trail... sure enough they find her but she's become trapped on a piece of land surrounded by rising flood water! Kat does her best to grab Baby with the winch but the storm is raging and Baby is moving around frantically watching her dummy floating in the water having lost it in the panic. Thinking quickly, Gecko gets Tilly to tow him from the bank as he uses the fence posts as water skis to pick up Baby's dummy and then reach her. With Baby calmed Kat is able to grab on to her with the winch from Helena and lift Baby and Gecko to safety - hurrah!\r\n\r\nGecko\u2019s Garage is an animated entertainment series for children aged between 2 and 5 set in a colorful world that\u2019s jam-packed with friendly vehicles, helper robots and a mechanic called Gecko.\r\n\r\nWatch more Gecko's Garage episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A91bztaXmFk&list=PLHmAAna0scKDUnM6jdDYxzrLsa5t8bWdz&index=1\r\n\r\nToddler Fun Learning makes fun, free and educational videos, nursery rhymes, stories and songs for toddlers all over the world.\r\n\r\nFind Gecko's Garage and Toddler Fun Learning on the Internet!\r\nWebsite \u25ba https://www.toddlerfunlearning.com/geckos_garage/\r\nFacebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/geckosgarageofficial/\r\nInstagram \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/geckosgarageofficial/\r\n\r\n#geckosgarage #kids\r\n\r\n00:00 Intro\r\n00:09 Baby Truck Storm Rescue\r\n02:13 Baby Truck Trick or Treat\r\n04:15 Flying Birthday Party Cake\r\n06:19 Tilly the Snowball\r\n09:23 Muddy Mechanicals Railway Mystery\r\n11:33 The Mystery Box\r\n13:38 Accidents Happen Helicopter\r\n15:42 Recycling Day Repairs\r\n18:45 Bobby's Broken Windscreen\r\n20:43 Fire at the Garage\r\n22:50 Baby Truck's Wobbly Tooth\r\n24:53 Sleepy Mechanicals\r\n26:59 Kat's Base Energy Crisis\r\n29:09 Monster Truck Boo Boo\r\n31:12 Fiona's Super Siren\r\n33:21 Sly and The Mole\r\n35:22 Car Wash Capers\r\n37:45 The Garage Is Haunted (Halloween)\r\n39:47 Rainbow Mechanicals Hide and Seek\r\n41:59 Dirty Weasel\r\n45:00 Grandma Gecko to the Rescue\r\n47:08 Weasel Plan Thief\r\n49:16 Mummy Truck Saves the Day\r\n51:24 Fair Play Football Mix Up\r\n54:34 Monster Truck Make Over\r\n56:38 Bobby the Bus Goes Electric\r\n58:46 Gecko is Stuck in Glue\r\n1:00:41 Rainy Day Emergency\r\n1:02:47 Green Saves the Tree\r\n1:04:51 Gecko's Accident",

Gecko explains to her that's it's perfectly normal - when teeth fall out, you put them under your pillow and get a coin. It'll fall out naturally, it could happen at any moment. As Gecko says this however, Baby Truck sneezes (since Red is doing some spring cleaning with a feather duster) and the tooth flies out. Baby is worried - if she can't find her tooth, how will she get her coin? Gecko and the Mechs search the garage for the tooth, and after searching in some very odd places, they have to admit defeat. That is, until they notice the tooth got stuck in Red's feather duster - it's been there all along!

They load it up, along with some old sticks and a net, all to take to the dump. As they go, they pass the truck family at the truck playground. However, Baby then goes down the slide too fast and lands hard, getting hurt and bursting into tears. Gecko wants to help, but then he and Mama Recycle get an idea. Using the trash, they 'upcycle' the net, sticks and old cushions to make the slide 'soft play' so Baby wont get hurt. Sure enough she slides down and bounces when she hits the ground. She has great fun with the mechs, whilst Gecko thanks Mama for teaching him about recycling\r\n\r\nGecko\u2019s Garage is an animated entertainment series for children aged between 2 and 5 set in a colorful world that\u2019s jam-packed with friendly vehicles, helper robots and a mechanic called Gecko.\r\n\r\nWatch more Gecko's Garage episodes here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A91bztaXmFk&list=PLHmAAna0scKDUnM6jdDYxzrLsa5t8bWdz&index=1\n\nCheck out the best Gecko's Garage songs:\nhttps://GeckosGarage.lnk.to/CompleteCollectionYT!DSC\r\n\r\nToddler Fun Learning makes fun, free and educational videos, nursery rhymes, stories and songs for toddlers all over the world.\r\n\r\nFind Gecko's Garage and Toddler Fun Learning on the Internet!\r\nWebsite \u25ba https://www.toddlerfunlearning.com/geckos_garage/\r\nFacebook \u25ba https://www.facebook.com/geckosgarageofficial/\r\nInstagram \u25ba https://www.instagram.com/geckosgarageofficial/\r\n\r\n#geckosgarage #kids\r\n\r\n00:00 Soft Play Boo Boo Recycle\r\n02:14 Motorcycle Misadventure\r\n05:15 Weasel's New Wheels\r\n07:27 No Monsters (Halloween)\r\n09:30 Molly's Lost Teddy Adventure\r\n11:42 Eric the Wrecking Ball\r\n14:37 Super Mechanical\r\n16:37 Runaway Car Wash\r\n19:36 Wake Up Weasel Cake Catastrophe\r\n22:35 Baby Truck Sleepover\r\n24:38 Motorcycle Madness\r\n26:47 Fire at the Garage\r\n28:54 Rainy Day Emergency\r\n30:58 Monster Truck Mix Up\r\n33:06 Bobby The Bus Is Sick\r\n35:18 Baby Truck is Sick\r\n37:25 Eric the Excavator's Service\r\n39:26 Don\u2019t Throw It\u2026 Fix Up and Fly It!\r\n41:31 Grandma vs Gadgets\r\n44:38 Baby Truck's Wobbly Tooth\r\n46:40 Emergency Ice Cream Adventure\r\n48:42 Monster Truck Make Over\r\n50:44 Earth Day: Farming Fix-up\r\n53:45 Bobby's Broken Windscreen\r\n55:43 Dirty Weasel\r\n58:44 Baby Race Pit Stop\r\n1:01:51 Trash Treasure Hunt\r\n1:03:54 Helena Ice Cream Helicopter\r\n1:06:54 The Mystery Box\r\n1:08:59 Blue is Lost\r\n1:12:03 Eric the Scorpion\r\n1:15:02 Flying Birthday Party Cake\r\n1:17:06 Bobby's Bus Route Boo Boo\r\n1:20:09 Rainbow Mechanicals Hide and Seek\r\n1:22:19 Tilly Tow Truck is Sick\r\n1:25:17 Gecko's Christmas Rescue\r\n1:27:25 Gecko Grand Prix\r\n1:30:32 Car Wash Capers\r\n1:32:54 Bouncy Castle Blimp Rescue\r\n1:35:57 Gecko is Snoring\r\n1:38:05 Runaway Caravan\r\n1:40:07 Muddy Maze Mission\r\n1:43:12 Gecko on the Bus\r\n1:45:17 Santa Gecko\r\n1:48:20 Weasel Plan Thief\r\n1:50:28 Balloon Race\r\n1:53:29 Weasel is Sick\r\n1:56:30 Magnet Madness\r\n1:58:32 Weasel Water Waste\r\n2:00:38 Baby Fire Truck\r\n2:02:48 Rainy Day Recharge\r\n2:05:52 Kat's Rocket Sky Chase\r\n2:07:53 Sly and The Mole\r\n2:09:54 Tilly the Snowball\r\n2:12:57 Share the Toy Baby Truck!\r\n2:15:55 Rainbow Buses\r\n2:18:58 Recycling Day Repairs\r\n2:22:00 Mending Mummy Truck\r\n2:25:01 Drive Thru Haunted House\r\n2:28:03 Gecko is Frozen\r\n2:30:02 Balloon Tyres",
