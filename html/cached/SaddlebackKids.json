      "description": "A note from Pastor Rick - \nHere's how to S.H.A.K.E. the Virus! Here\u2019s the backstory of the fun video I came up with.\n\nBob Redfield, the national director of the CDC, is a very close friend of Kay and me. We\u2019ve traveled together, worked on the AIDS pandemic together, and when I asked for his help in creating a church-based community health care program for Rwanda, Bob invented the process that we used to train 6,000 Rwandans serving through their churches. That program is now being copied elsewhere.\n\nAt the beginning of the COVID 19 crisis, Bob called and asked me to use my channels to pastors to help get out the correct information to churches everywhere. I did that, but I also started thinking about a fun way to spread the message to kids.\n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard of the 5 actions that the CDC recommends everyone do to prevent the virus from spreading: wash your hand often, cough into your elbow instead of your hand, don\u2019t touch your face, keep a 6 foot social distance from others, and stay at home. Even Google promoted these 5 actions on their home page for days.\n\nBut I thought, \u201cNobody is going to remember all 5, especially little kids. It needs to be memorable and fun! So, since I often create acrostics as memory devices (like our P.E.A.C.E. plan, or our S.H.A.P.E. profile) I created an acrostic for 5 WAYS TO S.H.A.K.E. THE VIRUS.\n\nNext I wrote a little tune with rhyming explanations, and I asked our Saddleback Kids ministry to come up with a dance and hand motions for each letter of S.H.A.K.E. Here is the video they created.\n\nI doubt that anyone would guess that a pastor wrote this! Our Saddleback Kids ministry is planning a contest for other kids, schools, and church youth groups to record their own version of \u201cS.H.A.K.E. the Virus.\"\n\nI now know what I\u2019ll do in retirement.\nWatch me whip! Watch neh neh!\n-Rick\n\nProduced by Casey Lagos",

The prayer from  our team is that these songs are planted in the hearts of kids now so they can speak to them throughout their lives. We pray that these songs would be the soundtrack to the everyday lives of families, provide words and music for kids to worship with at church, and fill homes with children singing out to God. We hope that this album will be a reminder that the presence of God is available not just to adults, but to every child for the Kingdom of God belongs to them!",

The prayer from our team is that these songs are planted in the hearts of kids now so they can speak to them throughout their lives. We pray that these songs would be the soundtrack to the everyday lives of families, provide words and music for kids to worship with at church, and fill homes with children singing out to God. We hope that this album will be a reminder that the presence of God is available not just to adults, but to every child for the Kingdom of God belongs to them!",

The prayer from our team is that these songs are planted in the hearts of kids now so they can speak to them throughout their lives. We pray that these songs would be the soundtrack to the everyday lives of families, provide words and music for kids to worship with at church, and fill homes with children singing out to God. We hope that this album will be a reminder that the presence of God is available not just to adults, but to every child for the Kingdom of God belongs to them!",
