Move up and down -- Humdinger!\nIn spider position till the end.

These exercises will help develop the beginning foundation necessary for children to comprehend reading, science, and math skills.

Why teach kindness?  There have been numerous studies which demonstrate the positive effects of kindness on health and well-being.  The kindness giver, receiver and even those observing the kind act immediately experience an increase in happiness, a blissful sense of euphoria, increase in energy, more optimism and a general feeling of being healthy.  Children who learn about compassion, respect, empathy and how to express acts of kindness in both words and actions, can have a positive impact on the world they live in.  It is proven that young children raised to understand the value of kindness are less likely to bully or even become violent.   \nRemember you can make a difference each time you brighten someone's life through small efforts like a smile, kind word, saying thank you or showing you care. \n\nLYRICS\n\nFill Your Bucket \nFrom the CD, #1 Best Kid's Songs\n\u00a9 Monopoli/The Learning Station\n\nWords for your word wall: \"Friendship\"  \"Kindness\" \"Helpful\" \"Polite\" \"Caring\" \"Respect\" \"Empathy\" \"Compassion\" \"Sympathy\" \"Concern\" \"Sharing\" \n\n\nHold the hands of the friends on either side of you,\nAnd don't let go at all. It's what we all should do.\n\nRefrain: It's only holding hands but it means so much.\nWe're filling buckets with just a simple touch.\nLet's be bucket fillers. That's what we all should be.\nOur bucket is invisible. It's really make-believe.\nBut there's no doubt in what a kind act can do.\nIt makes someone feel good, then comes right back to you.\n\nChorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.\nWhen we're nice, we fill yours too.\nWhen we help, we fill our bucket.\nWhen we smile, we fill yours too.\nKeep holding hands and sway from side to side.                                                                                                                                   We feel much better now, and we know why.\nRefrain: It's only holding hands but it means so much.\nWe're filling buckets with just a simple touch.\nLet's be bucket fillers. That's what we all should be.\nOur bucket is invisible.

(Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nTony knows. Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.) \nTony Chestnut knows I love you. (Point to your toes, knees, chest, head, nose, eyes, heart and to a friend.) \nThat's what Tony knows. (Point to your toes, knees and nose.) \nTony, Tony and his sister Eileen. (Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.) \nAnd Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat. (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.) \nBut Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.) \nAnd there's Russell and Skip. (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) \nThis song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.) \nHow it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.) \nAnd guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut. (Hold your arms up in the air. Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.) \n\n* Talk directing music to play faster. Cup your hands and pretend you are stirring the musical pot that is controlling the speed of the music. Stir faster and faster. Repeat all the lyrics and movements above. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheLearningStation",

Memory/recall 2. Loud/soft 3. Large/small 4. Rhyming 5. Body parts\nSuggestions:\nBegin in a sitting position. Listen carefully and do what Willy says.\n\n\"Willy Dilly Diddle Hop Canilly\" lyrics\nMy name is Willy. Let's be silly. Let's play the Willy Dilly Diddle Hop Canilly. Say What?\nIt's silly. The Willy Dilly Diddle Hop Canilly.\nNow, this is how to play this game. What Willy says, you do the same.\nStand up. Sit down. Stand up. Spin around.\nChorus: Now, wasn't that silly? That's why we call it, the Willy Dilly Diddle Hop Canilly\nNow Willy says to say his name.\nPart A: Say Willy - Say Willy Dilly - Say Willy Dilly Diddle - Say Willy Dilly Diddle Hop\nSay Willy Dilly Diddle Hop Canilly -\nRepeat Chorus\nNow Willy says put your hands on your hips. Flap your wings and make chicken lips.\nNow strut like a chicken - strut, strut, strut. Now cluck like a chicken - cluck, cluck, cluck.\nPut it all together and you will see, Willy makes fun for you and me.\nRepeat Chorus\nNow Willy says to point your toes, pinch your ear and hold your nose.\nNow count to 3 - 1,2,3, ABC - abc\nRepeat Chorus\nNow Willy says to clap along. See if you can follow this song. (echo clapping)\nWilly says stand straight and tall. Pretend that you're a ten foot wall. Now you're not tall, you're very small. In fact you are a rubber ball. Now bounce like a ball. Boing, boing, boing, boing.\nRepeat Chorus\nNow Willy says let's monkey around. Scratch your belly and make this sound, eet, eet.\nNow peel a banana and eat it real slow. It's the Willy Dilly Diddle hop don't you know.\nNow Willy says you're a tiny seed growing up to a big oak tree. Now spread your arms,\npretend they're limbs.

Through friendly gestures and movements involving group interaction, children are encouraged to introduce themselves to each other.\n2. Movements include: shaking hands during each chorus, waving to each other, holding hands and swaying together, singing (La, La, La) and clapping.\n3. This song can be used to introduce children to each other on the first day of school or to reinforce a positive expression of friendship anytime.\n\n\"Special Friends\" Lyrics:\nWhen you're meeting someone new. Shake their hand say, \"How do you do?\" Say hello, shake a hand, make a friend. \nIf you should see a friend today, wave a hand cause it's the way to say hello, wave a hand, make a friend.\nCHORUS\nI want to be your friend, a special friend and shake your hand. I want to be your friend, a special friend and shake your hand.\nLet's all hold hands and sway as one. We're making friends, it's lots of fun. Say hello, hold\u00acing hands, make a friend.\nSing together la, la, la - la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la. Say hello, la, la, la, make a friend.\nREPEAT CHORUS\nClap your hands and feel the beat. Cause making friends is really neat. Say hello, clap along, make a friend. \nSo when you're meeting someone new, shake their hand say, \"How do you do?\" Say hello, shake a hand, make a friend.\nREPEAT CHORUS\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/TheLearningStation",

Sometimes you see big bones all connected in a museum, or sometimes by themselves. The reason why we're singing about bones is because that's the framework that keeps us together. That's why we stand straight and tall and proud and that's why we sing this song.\" The toe bone's connected to the foot bone. The foot bone's connected to the ankle bone. The ankle bone's connected to the shin bone. The shin bone's connected to the knee bone. \n\nChorus: We got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connections. Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) 2xWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connections. The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone. The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone. The hip bone's connected to the back bone. The back bone's connected to the chest bones. Repeat Chorus\n\nThe chest bone's connected to the shoulder bone. The shoulder bone's connected to the arm bone. The arm bone's connected to the wrist bone. The wrist bone's connected to the hand bone. \n\nRepeat Chorus The neck bone's connected to the head bone. The head bone's connected to the nose bone. (That's cartilage!) Well, how about the ear bone. (That's cartilage too!) \"We have more parts than I thought!\" Repeat Chorus \n\n\"That's right, you got to keep your bones real healthy and real strong. You got to make sure you get enough calcium because that's the framework of your body to stay real healthy. Keep your teeth real strong and healthy too.\"\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation",

So take a break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress.

Dancing around the Christmas tree with me. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Dancing around the Christmas tree. Now it's time to choose a friend and this is what we'll do. It's time to skip together cause it's so much fun with two. Round the Christmas tree, round the Christmas tree, skip around the tree. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Skipping around the Christmas tree with me. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Skipping around the Christmas tree. You see the fun has just begun but now it's time to STOP! Now it's time to change and turn that skip into a hop.  Round the Christmas tree, round the Christmas tree, hop around the tree. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Hopping around the Christmas tree with me. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Hopping around the Christmas tree. The song I almost over we danced so merrily.  Let's end it with a happy note and clap around the tree. Round the Christmas tree, round the Christmas tree, clap around the tree. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Clapping around the Christmas tree with me. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Clapping around the Christmas tree. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Clapping around the Christmas tree with me. Merrily we go, merrily we go. Clapping around the Christmas tree. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation",

Bring it down to negotiate. Rub your ears, unfold the flaps.\nListening, becomes a snap. Rub your ears. It helps us hear the music. Rub your ears. (2x)\nTime now to get back on task. Wave to a friend, this feeling can last.\nFind your seat, or sit where you are. Slowly, calmly, be a star.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation",

Lullabies are a soothing way to relax children.  A melodic lullaby brings down their heart rate and creates a calming feeling.  For infants, they are a great bonding connection between parent and child.  For older children they help release stress, fears and anxiety.  \nResearch has proven that lullaby music actually has many therapeutic values. As infants, babies and children listen to these soothing melodic lullabies it actually creates a peaceful hypnotic state. Lullabies also increase oxygen saturation and reduced stress behavior.\nModern research is still only beginning to discover the full benefits of lullabies. Because their bodies are growing, infants, babies and children need more sleep than adults. Parents have been singing lullabies to their children for thousands of years and they have instinctively known that it helps their children to relax. It\u2019s exciting to have scientific evidence that lullabies offer a plethora of health benefits for our children. Ideal for lullabies for babies to go to sleep. \n                                                                                                                                                                               \nFrom the CD, Play to Rest\nby The Learning Station\n\u2117\u00a9Monopoli/The Learning Station \nPlaylist includes (looped):\n0:00 - Intro\n0:17 - Lullaby Collage \n2:12 - Forty Winks \n5:48 - Rainy Day \n9:36 - Puffy Clouds  \n12:23 - Sandman  \n15:47 - Shhhh  \n18:44 - Tiny Star  \n21:05 - Relax With Me  \n24:29 - Lullaby Collage \n26:32 - Forty Winks \n30:08 - Rainy Day \n33:56 - Puffy Clouds \n36:42 - Sandman \n40:06 - Shhhh \n43:03 - Tiny Star \n45:25 - Relax With Me \n48:50 - Lullaby Collage \n50:52 - Forty Winks \n54:29 - Rainy Day \n58:17 - Puffy Clouds \n1:01:03 - Sandman \n1:04:27 - Shhhh \n1:07:24 - Tiny Star \n1:09:46 - Relax With Me \n\nVisit The Learning Station: http://www.learningstationmusic.com\nVisit our store!

Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\n Hibernation is the way some animals keep warm all day. In the cold winter months like a bear in a cave, birds fly south and that\u2019s called migration, hibernation, migration.\nFrogs are in the mud and they sleep all day. And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that\u2019s called hibernation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nEvaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn\u2019t last. The sun comes out and it heats to steam. But you can\u2019t see what seems to be evaporation. Evaporation, evaporation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nGravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nMetamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don\u2019t know. Do you know why it happens? Metamorphosis!\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/thelearningstation",

When we find the pattern, we feel safe. Singing helps children find the \npattern so they can create an internal mental model of appropriate behavior and bathroom manners.

The bears went for a walk while their porridge cooled. Goldie saw their door and she knocked, knocked, knocked.\nNo one came to the door, she tried again, knock, knock, knock.\nNo one answered the door, she tried again, knock, knock, knock.\nNobody came to the door. She let herself in, because it wasn\u2019t locked. Then to her surprise, she saw three bowls. The porridge was poured near each Bear\u2019s seat. She really wanted milk and cinnamon rolls but she picked up the spoon and started to eat.\nWhen she tried the great big Papa Bear\u2019s, that porridge was way too hot. And when she tried the middle-sized Mama Bear\u2019s, that porridge was way too cold. Then she tried the little-itty Baby Bear\u2019s. That porridge was just right, so she ate and she ate it all up.  \nShe looked around the house and saw three chairs, somewhere to sit for Goldilocks. She didn\u2019t know the chairs belonged to bears. She sat upon them all and rocked and rocked. When she tried the great big Papa Bear\u2019s, that chair was way too hard. And when she tried the middle-sized Mama Bear\u2019s, that chair was way too soft.\nThen she tried the little-itty Baby Bear\u2019s. That chair was just right, so she rocked and rocked and broke it all to pieces. Then she went upstairs to rest her head after all the porridge and rocking fun. \nThat\u2019s where she saw three bear sized beds. She laid on them all and tried each one. When she tried the great big Papa Bear\u2019s, that bed was way too high. And when she tried the middle-sized Mama Bear\u2019s, that bed was way too low. Then she tried the little-itty Baby Bear\u2019s.  That bed was just right, and there she stayed and fell asleep, fast asleep. Just about that time the bears came home, just about in time for something strange. When they knew they might not be alone they looked around to see what might have changed.\nSomebody\u2019s been eating my porridge. Somebody\u2019s been eating my porridge too. Somebody\u2019s been eating my porridge and guess what? WHAT? They ate it all up! Somebody\u2019s been rocking in my chair. Somebody\u2019s been rocking in my chair too. Somebody\u2019s been rocking in my chair and guess what? WHAT? They broke it all up!\nSomebody\u2019s been sleeping in my bed. Somebody\u2019s been sleeping in my bed too. Somebody\u2019s been sleeping in my bed and guess what? WHAT? There she is! AHHH! Goldilocks sprang out of bed and ran from the house real fast. And when she got in her Mama asked where she\u2019d been. And Goldie said, \u201cMama, please don\u2019t ask!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoldilocks and the Three Bears\u201d is a popular children\u2019s fairy tale that is ideal for a kid\u2019s bedtime story, classroom storybook time for children, anytime your children would enjoy a classic fairy tale/rhyming song.  \u201cGoldilocks and the Three Bears Song\u201d is great for toddlers, preschoolers, kindergarten and elementary children.

Now, Dancer! Now Prancer and Vixen! \nOn, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donner and Blitzen! \nTo the top of the porch! To the top of the wall! \nNow dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!\" \nAs leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, \nWhen they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky; \nSo up to the housetop the coursers they flew \nWith the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too \u2014 \nAnd then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof \nthe prancing and pawing of each little hoof. \nAs I drew in my head, and was turning around, \nDown the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. \nHe was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot, \nAnd his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot; \nA bundle of toys he had flung on his back, \nAnd he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. \nHis eyes how they twinkled! His dimples, how merry! \nHis cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry! \nHis droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, \nAnd the beard on his chin was as white as the snow; \nThe stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, \nAnd the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath; \nHe had a broad face and a little round belly \nThat shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. \nHe was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf, \nAnd I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself; \nA wink of his eye and a twist of his head \nSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread; \nHe spoke not a word, but went straight to his work, \nAnd filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk, \nAnd laying his finger aside of his nose, \nAnd giving a nod, up the chimney he rose; \nHe sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, \nAnd away they all flew like the down of a thistle. \nBut I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight\u2014 \n\u201cHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!\u201d\n**************************\n\ud83c\udf85 Children\u2019s Christmas Illustrations and animation by the renowned Corbett Vanoni: https://www.facebook.com/CorbettVanoniArt\n**************************\n\ud83c\udf85 LIKE us on Facebook and participate in FREE giveaways galore: http://www.facebook.com/LearningStationMusic\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel new videos are uploaded every Thursday: https://www.youtube.com/user/TheLearningStation\n\n\ud83c\udf85 Visit our Christmas playlist for kids.

We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back. It just couldn\u2019t stay away.\nAway, Away, Away\nHe gave it to a trucker that was going to Mexico.\nThe trucker stopped for coffee at a \u201cTrucker Stop & Go\u201d.\nBut while he was a\u2019 paying he knew that he was stuck\nHe saw the cat jump in the cab and take off with his truck.\nChorus: But the cat came back, the very next day.\nThe cat came back. We thought he was a goner.\nBut the cat came back.

Got to watch out for those waves.\u201d And then she told us to do this:Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. Row with your right hand and hang on with your left. Keep on rowing or those waves will get you wet. Now row with your left hand and hang on with your right. Now row the boat with both hands and row with all your might. Narrator: Now the captain\u2019s standing in the bow of the boat and even though I could barely see her face in the shimmering moonlight, I could tell she was very concerned.

Narrator: The captain said, \u201cNice job, but I\u2019m afraid the excitement\u2019s not over. I need everyone to be calm because there\u2019s a waterfall ahead on the horizon and we\u2019re going too fast to stop. So we have to speed up and jump right over it. Come on!\u201dRow, row, row your boat gently down the stream. Merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream. Row, row, row your boat gently down the stream.

      "description": "Download your Rivet app today! The Learning Station is honored to be part of this incredible reading app for children! Far too many kids struggle to read at an age-appropriate level, but Google is betting that technology could help them get up to speed. The company's experimental Area 120 unit has released Rivet, an app for Android and iOS that aims to make reading practice both accessible and rewarding. It offers more than 2,000 books ranked by difficulty, and uses speech technology to coach kids on their pronunciation. Rivet can read words or whole pages, highlighting words as it goes along, but it can also listen to a child's own reading and offer feedback on the words they didn't get right.\n\nThe app also relies on game mechanics to spur young readers. Kids earn points and badge, and it customizes the whole affair with avatars, recommended books and themes. Area 120 also promises \"energizing games\" and \"surprises\" to keep readers on their toes.\n\nPrivacy is unsurprisingly important. All that speech tech is strictly on-device, and the app requires parental consent. Data is only used to improve the reading experience inside the app.\n\nApp Store: https://goo.gl/AA4w9c\nPlay Store: https://goo.gl/g97RP4\nRivet is available in US, CA, IN, AU, NZ on iOS & Android mobile devices, tablets and Chromebooks.\n\nWant to learn more about Rivet? Check out their website: \nhttps://rivet.area120.com/home\nRivet Song                              \nReading is fun fun-damental\nWith Rivet, the fun reading app\nWith thousands of books and 8 levels\nAll at your fingertips with just one tap.\n\nSo tap level one or tap level two\nThere you\u2019ll find The Learning Station \nBooks JUST for you\nOn Rivet the fun reading app\nAll at your fingertips with just one tap,\njust one tap.

(No) \n\nWell then, step by step, trudge, trudge, trudge, we made it through the swamp now shake off the mud. Look around do you see any bears? (No)\nWe\u2019re going on a bear hunt and what do we see but a great big lake right in front of me.\nIt\u2019s so wide we can\u2019t go around it. But then, can we go over it? (No) Can we go under it? (Uh,Uh) Looks like we\u2019re gonna have to swim. \nOkay, swim, swim, swim, splash, splash, splash, stroke, stroke, stroke, we\u2019re swimming really fast. Look around do you see any bears? (No)\nSwim, swim, swim, splash, splash, splash, we made it through the lake now dry off really fast. \nLook around do you see any bears? (No) We\u2019re going on a bear hunt and what do we see but a great big cave right in front of me. I heard that bears are asleep this time of day. \nIf you want to go in we\u2019ll have to be real quiet, okay? (okay) Crawling to the cave, creep, creep, creep. Crawling in the cave I hope the bear\u2019s asleep. Look around do you see any bears? (No)\nWait a minute, I see eyes, big yellow eyes, they\u2019re not yours and they\u2019re not mine. \nThey must belong to the bear. AHHHH! Running from the bear cave and what do we see but the great big lake right in front of me. Looks like we\u2019re gonna have to swim.

(Point to your toes, knees, toes, knees then lean to the right.)\nAnd Eileen loves Neil and Neil loves Pat.  (Everyone lean to the right, kneel and pat your shoulders.)\nBut Pat still loves Bob. (Pat your shoulders and bounce your head back and forth.)\nAnd there's Russell and Skip.  (Standup, wiggle your legs then skip in place.) \nThis song is silly, but it's hip. (Make a silly face then stick out your right hip and point to it.)\nHow it ends, just one man knows. (Turn and point to your bottom.)\nAnd guess what (what), it's Tony Chestnut.  (Hold your arms up in the air.  Point to your toes, knees, chest and head.) \n**************************\n\u2764 SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel today!

When children take a moment to sing, dance, move, and even laugh then they can return to their academics feeling happy, joyous, energized and renewed. More and more schools are realizing the significant values of brain breaks for both students and teachers. So take a break, about every 35 minutes, to get up, move, dance and release all that built-up energy and stress. In the classroom this brain breaks dance song is perfect for the preschool and kindergarten. \n\nOur popular children's brain breaks break, dance song, \"C'MON LET'S DANCE\" is from the award-winning CD, You Can Dance! \nYou Can Dance!

This song inspires a child\u2019s natural curiosity to explore and learn about the world around them.  The Science Song is perfect for preschoolers, kindergarten and elementary age kids.  It is also a great ESL and EFL song for children.\n\nThe Science Song                                                                                                                                                                                          From the CD, Children Love to Sing and Dance                                                                                                                                           by The Learning Station (Also, known as Learning Station)\n\u2117\u00a9Monopoli/The Learning Station \nLyrics:\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\n Hibernation is the way some animals keep warm all day. In the cold winter months like a bear in a cave, birds fly south and that\u2019s called migration, hibernation, migration.\nFrogs are in the mud and they sleep all day. And squirrels gather nuts in the autumn days, so they can stay warm in their winter ways. When they do then that\u2019s called hibernation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nEvaporation happens fast, it starts like a puddle but it doesn\u2019t last. The sun comes out and it heats to steam. But you can\u2019t see what seems to be evaporation. Evaporation, evaporation.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nGravity is a special force, it holds everything very close to the earth. Just like a magnet pulling down to the ground, and what goes up must come down. Must come down.\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nMetamorphosis is coming soon for the caterpillar and his cocoon. He changes to a butterfly. I don\u2019t know. Do you know why it happens? Metamorphosis!\nSay, hibernation (hibernation), evaporation (evaporation), gravity (gravity),\nand metamorphosis (metamorphosis).\nScience is a part of our everyday lives. Wonderful surprises right before your very eyes.\nScience, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh. Science, Oh, Oh, Oh.\n\nThis popular science song for kids inspires creativity, observation and imagination. \u201cThe Science Song\u201d is from the CD, Children Love to Sing and Dance.

And it can get very cold especially when\nIN THE WINTER\u2026\n\nOf course, winter is just one of the 4 seasons, which all have different weather and temperatures, but the season after winter makes it easy to put your coats away. After all, IN THE SPRING\u2026\n\nWarm weather is so pleasant. Rain showers and pretty flowers! But what follows Spring is lots of sun and high temperatures, because\u2026IN THE SUMMER  \n\nAfter all the sun and scorching weather of the summer, it\u2019s time to put away your swimsuits and break out your sweaters and jackets for the next season. It\u2019s Autumn but some people like to say IN THE FALL\u2026\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter what season it is, every single amazing day gives you a new beginning, and another reason to be helpful, thankful and just plain wonderful!\n\nIf you\u2019re like me, it\u2019s fun seeing people you care about. They are all like shining stars, and you know what? They make you feel like a shining star too! \n\nWhat we learned today, is that any season is the season of caring for and caring about people you love. Those people ARE shining stars and YOU are shining stars to them! Can you can just feel it? \n\nThanks for watching and joining in!  This program was brought to you by Old McDonald\u2019s Farm where it\u2019s okay to have a cow. And by 5 Little Ducks where mother duck just quacks you up! I look forward to seeing you next time!

Spin when appropriate and act out the story such as bouncing, digging and being a tree that grows branches.\n\nChorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.\n\nI made my first dreidel out of some clay.\nI painted on symbols then I put it away.\nThe clay had all hardened and the paint was all dried.\nI looked at my dreidel and what a surprise!\n\nChorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.\n\nThe dreidel was spinning, spinning all by itself.\nI watched in amazement as it spun off the shelf.\nIt was spinning so fast then that it looked like a top, but there was one problem.\nIt just wouldn't stop.\n\nChorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.\n\nIt spun to the kitchen, then it bounced on the floor. Flew right by my window, then right out the door.\nIt spun down the stairs then but it didn't go far. It just started digging a big hole in my yard.\n\nChorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel\nwe will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.\n\nThe digging was over. Things quieted down. The dreidel had planted itself in the ground.\nThrough spring and then summer, and then into fall, the dreidel was growing to about ten feet tall.\n\nChorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.\n\nThe dreidel grew branches and then grew some more and from all those branches grew dreidels galore.\nThis story is silly but it never ends for now we have dreidels for all of our friends.\n\nChorus: Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play. Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel, I made it out of clay and when it's dried and ready, oh dreidel we will play.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/TheLearningStation\n\n#DreidelDreidelSongByTheLearningStation #DreidelDreidelDreidel #theSongCalledDreidelDreidelDreidel #DreidelSongForKids #dreidelDreidelSongLyrics #Dradle",

      "description": "Bucket fillers' are those who help without being asked, give hugs and compliments, and generally spread their love and good feelings to others.\n\nYes, lyrics in this song have everyone holding hands, shouting, etc. which is not considered safe and is contrary to social distancing during this present pandemic. Our goal is that we can delete this paragraph as soon as December 2021, when we hopefully can follow directions of this song as it's meant to be used with all the children of the world!\n\n Why teach kindness? There have been numerous studies which demonstrate the positive effects of kindness on health and well-being.  The kindness giver, receiver and even those observing the kind act immediately experience an increase in happiness, a blissful sense of euphoria, increase in energy, more optimism and a general feeling of being healthy.  Children who learn about compassion, respect, empathy and how to express acts of kindness in both words and actions, can have a positive impact on the world they live in.  It is proven that young children raised to understand the value of kindness are less likely to bully or even become violent.   \nRemember you can make a difference each time you brighten someone's life through small efforts like a smile, kind word, saying thank you or showing you care. \n\nFill Your Bucket, from the award-winning CD, #1 Best Kid's Songs!\nCD Download: https://www.learningstationmusic.com/product/1-best-kid-s-songs-cd-download/\n\nCD: https://www.learningstationmusic.com/product/1-best-kid-s-songs-cd/\nVisit The Learning Station: https://www.learningstationmusic.com/\n\nFill Your Bucket \nFrom the CD, #1 Best Kid's Songs\n\u00a9 Monopoli/The Learning Station\n\nLYRICS\nHold the hands of the friends on either side of you,\nAnd don't let go at all.

That's what we all should be.\nOur bucket is invisible. It's really make-believe.\nBut there's no doubt in what a kind act can do.\nIt makes someone feel good, then comes right back to you.\n\nChorus: When we're kind, we fill our bucket.\nWhen we're nice, we fill yours too.\nWhen we help, we fill our bucket.\nWhen we smile, we fill yours too.\nKeep holding hands and sway from side to side.

Sometimes you see big bones all connected in a museum, or sometimes by themselves. But the reason why we\u2019re singing about bones is because that\u2019s the framework that keeps us together. That\u2019s why we stand straight and tall and proud and that\u2019s why we sing this song.\u201d \n\nThe toe bone\u2019s connected to the foot bone. The foot bone\u2019s connected to the ankle bone. \nThe ankle bone\u2019s connected to the shin bone. The shin bone\u2019s connected to the knee bone. \nWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Now, your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \n\nThe knee bone\u2019s connected to the thigh bone. The thigh bone\u2019s connected to the hip bone. \nThe hip bone\u2019s connected to the back bone. The back bone\u2019s connected to the chest bones. \nWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Now, your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \n\nThe chest bone\u2019s connected to the shoulder bone. The shoulder bone\u2019s connected to the arm bone. \nThe arm bone\u2019s connected to the wrist bone. The wrist bone\u2019s connected to the hand bone. \nWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Now, your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nWe got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \n\nThe neck bone\u2019s connected to the head bone. \nThe head bone\u2019s connected to the nose bone. (That\u2019s cartilage!) \nWell, how about the ear bone. (That\u2019s cartilage too!) \u201cWe have more parts than I thought!\u201d \nWe\u2019ve got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Now, your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones. Your turn. ( Ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.) \nWe\u2019ve got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \n \u201cThat\u2019s right, you got to keep your bones real healthy and real strong. You got to make sure you get enough calcium because that\u2019s the framework of your body to stay real healthy. Keeps your teeth real strong and healthy too.\u201d \nWe\u2019ve got so many parts and so many sections. We need the bones to make the connection. \nBa, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, ba, bones.
