I always thought of the characters in our story as the scientists and maybe the uranium nucleus itself. It was only through making the documentary that I realized the real hero of the story is the neutron. Without a neutral nuclear particle, it would be virtually impossible to release the energy from the nucleus. But with it, and the idea of a chain reaction, nuclear energy went from science fiction to reality. That is something I had not grasped as clearly before and it motivated me to make this video.\n\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno.",

      "description": "The truth, with photons.\nI hope I've articulated everything clearly in this video. If not, I'll clarify in comments. Thanks to everyone who appears in this video and thanks to everyone who watches this video!\n\nVeritasium is of course a combination of the latin 'veritas' meaning truth, and the common element ending 'ium'. I guess this is my version of the 'draw my life' craze that rolled through YouTube many years ago. Except I wanted to tell my story with the actual moments, the photons, the stored magnetic states. There's something about that which is so important to me (because I think the alternative involves fooling yourself) which is why I'm so fascinated by film and video.\n\nOne of my inspirations for the name Veritasium came from the end of the poem Ode on a Grecian Urn by John Keats, in which he writes:\n \"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,\u2014that is all\n                Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.\"\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nTony Fadell, Donal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Yildiz Kabaran, \nTerrance Snow, Stan Presolski\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com\nMagnified X1 - Gunnar Johnsen\nFluorescent Lights - Martin Gauffin\nDissolving Patterns - Ebb & Flod\nLuna - Ebb & Flod\n\nAdditional music by Kevin MacLeod: http://incompetech.com\nSneaky Snitch",

I changed a lot of my preconceptions, specifically I thought:\n\n1. That the Earth's magnetic field was a passive thing - it shouldn't need a continuous input of energy to maintain itself (that seemed reasonable to me because the magnetic field has been around for a long time and it seems mostly stable). But as it turns out, the Earth is a giant electromagnet, and so of course those currents dissipate their energy as they encounter resistance in the liquid metal through which they flow. So the energy to continuously create these currents comes from the kinetic energy of the liquid metal flows in the Earth's outer core.\n\n2. If it's convection, I'm thinking hot things rising, cooler things falling. But apparently the main effect driving convection is the compositional differences at the boundary with the Earth's inner core. This is because of the differential freezing at the boundary. Things like iron freeze into the inner core, while elements like sulfur do not. Hence the pockets of lighter material which then rise outwards.\n\n3. I didn't get why the fluid motion was necessary for the generation of the magnetic field. I mean if it's a conducting liquid, it can conduct currents whether it moves or not. But the key is that the liquid metal can 'trap' magnetic fields. I imagine this like how iron channels magnetic fields. Then once these fields are channeled, they can be pulled and stretched, making more magnetic field.\n\n4. Fluids operate very differently in rotating frames of reference. This is something I didn't intuitively grasp. But, as fluids move from the inner core outwards, those particles are moving much more slowly in the direction of rotation than the matter that has been there for a long time, which means the convection currents get deflected and form helices.\n\nMusic by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com Brandenburg Concerto No4",

Some pigments selectively absorb UV so they may appear white in the visible but dark in the UV. The pigments usually dissipate the UV energy as heat, though the breaking of bonds can also occur.\n2. Fluorescent molecules absorb UV light and re-radiate that energy as visible light. This makes them look dark in the UV but glowing under black light.\n3. Ultraviolet light scatters more than visible light because the wavelength is shorter and Raleigh scattering is proportional to the reciprocal of wavelength to the power of four.\n\nSpecial thanks to HHMI BioInteractive for their awesome animations of melanocytes and how the melanin in melanosomes protect your DNA.

      "description": "The nutrient content of food is declining. Is it because of soil depletion, selective breeding, or... something else?\nWatch my new documentary, VITAMANIA: http://ve42.co/vita\n\nI came across this story as I was making the film Vitamania. When you ask sellers of vitamins why you should take vitamin supplements even if you eat a healthy diet, they will say because our food doesn't contain all the nutrients it once did. This is supposedly due to soil depletion, cold storage, food ripening off the vine, and global transport of out-of-season foods. And to an extent this is true. Foods contain the greatest amount of nutrients if they are eaten soon after they are harvested. An unexpected source of nutrient decline is the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It causes plants to grow faster and bulk up on carbs but at the expense of other nutrients, so in percentage terms the amount of nutrients are actually declining. For now this decline is modest so supplementing with vitamin pills is probably unnecessary for most people with a healthy diet but it may be a concern in future.\n\nThanks to Kate Pappas & Chris Kamen for writing, producing and filming this video with me\nEdited by Lucy McCallum\nSound mix by Wayne Hyett\nFact Checking by Calvin Lee and Claire Smith \nThanks to the Collingwood Children\u2019s Farm and Glenn Fitzgerald from the University of Melbourne & Agriculture Victoria\n\nFurther Reading: \n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889157516302113\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15637215/?ncbi_mmode=std\nhttp://soils.wisc.edu/facstaff/barak/poster_gallery/minneapolis2000a/\nhttps://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2017/09/13/food-nutrients-carbon-dioxide-000511\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-24/scientists-warning-rice-may-become-less-nutritious/9792822",

This is something I learned filming with the UV camera inside.\n\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Hayley Golbach, @hayleysgold on twitter\nhttps://twitter.com/hayleysgold\n\nUltraviolet light causes damage to DNA, leads to cancer and photoaging: age spots and wrinkles. I was curious about this because UV is technically non-ionizing. A photon of UV doesn't have enough energy to strip an electron off atoms or molecules. However it does have enough energy to trigger photo-chemical reactions. For example, it causes pyrimidine dimers - the unauthorized covalent bonding of adjacent thymine or cytosine bases in our DNA. If these spots are not properly repaired, they may lead to mutations and cancer. Photoaging is typically the result of degradation of collagen and elastin fibers - scaffolding that supports the skin. This leads to wrinkles and saggy-looking skin.\n\nHuge thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Jeff Straathof, Zach Mueller, Ron Neal, Nathan Hansen, Yildiz Kabaran, Terrance Snow, Stan Presolski, James M Nicholson, KIMoFy\n\nSupport Veritasium on Patreon: http://ve42.co/patreon\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound http://epidemicsound.com \"Serene Story 2\"",

      "description": "This fungus lives on your scalp and may affect the genes you express.\nCheck out Head & Shoulders research on getting rid of dandruff: https://ve42.co/HS\n\nAnimation by Pindex: https://ve42.co/pindex\n\nWhen I started this project, I wasn't sure what caused dandruff and I also didn't think much science would go into making a shampoo like Head & Shoulders. So what I learned really surprised me:\n\nThere are hundreds of scientists working on this shampoo. They run crazy-sounding experiments like hanging hair near Tokyo highways to understand how real-world environments deposit dirt on hair. They use sophisticated scientific techniques like electron microscopes, nuclear magnetic resonance and gene sequencing to study dandruff on the molecular level.\n\nIn fact they sequenced the entire genome of Malassezia globosa in 2002, one year after the human genome project. Their findings are published in international refereed journals. What they have found is that the Malassezia fungi create free fatty acids as byproducts of their digestion, which for some people create irritation and lead to hyper-proliferation of skin cells, flaking, histamines, inflammatory cytokines, and blood proteins reaching the surface of the skin. These findings indicate the unhealthiness of dandruff scalp and suggest a possible remedy - controlling the metabolism of the Malassezia fungi. This is achieved using different active ingredients in different products and different parts of the world, including zinc pyrithione, selenium sulfide, and piroctone olamine. With the reduction of irritants, the scalp actually expresses different genes, producing a signature more similar to a non-dandruff baseline scalp.\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com\nMusic also by Kevin MacLeod: http://incompetech.com",

      "description": "A trip to #Mars involves radiation, muscle and bone loss, intermediate axis theorem and liquids.\nCheck out Mars on National Geographic, Monday Nov 12 at 9/8c\n#sponsored\n\nWhen I got offered the chance to fly in another #zeroG plane, I jumped at the chance. Do you know how hard it is when you are thrust into low-gravity, like the 37% of Earth's gravity of Mars, and you have to remember what you were going to say in a 30 second window as blood floods your head? It's pretty hard. It would be even harder to actually travel to Mars. It would take about 8 months in microgravity during which time your muscles and bones would weaken substantially, even if you exercise for hours a day like the astronauts on the space station. And your heart is a muscle too so it weakens as well. Before I contemplated these rates of muscle and bone loss, I thought the major challenge with a round trip journey to Mars would be the logistics of spacecraft and having enough fuel to get back. But with the weakening of the human body, it's an open question whether anyone would really want to come back.\n\nFilmed by Steve Boxall\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: http://epidemicsound.com",

So far we understand little - just that certain regions of the brain appear to be involved in certain activities and certain disorders. In extreme cases this has led to the practice of removing sections of the brain, or using electrodes or optical fibers to control activation rates. What is unique about this approach is it offers a way to turn on and off specific brain regions without invasive surgery. It has promise because it combines existing technologies: micro-bubbles, ultrasound, synthetic viruses, and synthetic drugs to achieve this goal.\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, James M Nicholson, Michael Krugman, Nathan Hansen, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd\n\nAnimations and editing by Alan Chamberlain\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental1\"",

      "description": "Is it possible to reconstruct sound from high-speed video images?\nPart of this video was sponsored by LastPass: http://bit.ly/2SmRQkk\nSpecial thanks to Dr. Abe Davis for revisiting his research with me: http://abedavis.com\n\nThis video was based on research by Dr. Abe Davis and colleagues. I found out about this work years ago and was fascinated by the way he was able to capture vibration information in image-only video. I always imagined the motions of objects would be visible as when recording a tuning fork in slow motion - so deriving sound from high speed images seemed a feasible task. But the reality is much more difficult.\n\nSound vibrations only cause objects to wiggle by about a micrometer. This is much smaller than a pixel, so the algorithm must understand the characteristics of the image. A move in one direction should cause some pixels to lighten slightly, while others darken - and this behavior is correlated along the edges of the image. So noise can be reduced because it's random over the image and there are enough places to sample that you can get it to cancel out.\n\nSomething I'm wondering now is - would it be possible to capture sound in a single image? I'm thinking it would have to be an image of a large object or space because the wavelengths of typical sounds are quite long. Maybe a high frequency sound could be imaged in a suitable medium...\n\nAnimations by Alan Chamberlain\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Seaweed\"",

Part count (reduced by having flexible parts instead of springs, hinges)\n2. Productions processes (many, new, different enabled by compliant designs)\n3. Price (reduced by fewer parts and different production processes)\n4. Precise Motion (no backlash, less wear, friction)\n5. Performance (no outgassing, doesn't require lubricant)\n6. Proportions (reduced through different production processes)\n7. Portability (lightweight due to simpler, reduced part count designs)\n8.

I grew up with the two technologies (film and video) in parallel and to me they always seemed like two ways of achieving the same ends: recording and replaying moving images. But their histories are quite distinct. Film was always a way to capture moving images for later replaying. Video started out as a way to transfer images from one place to another instantaneously. This dates back to the first fax machine, mechanical TV, live broadcast tv and ultimately videotapes. This history focuses on the early decades of video and not the more recent switches to chip cameras and solid state storage. Maybe that's a story for another day.\n\nAdditional resources and references:\n\nThe Dawn of Tape: Transmission Device as Preservation Medium\nhttps://ve42.co/dawnoftape\n\nWhat Sparked Video Research in 1877?

      "description": "We have just seen the first image of a black hole, the supermassive black hole in the galaxy M87 with a mass 6.5 billion times that of our sun. But what is that image really showing us?\n\nThis is an awesome paper on the topic by J.P. Luminet:\nImage of a spherical black hole with thin accretion disk\nAstronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 75, no. 1-2, May 1979, p. 228-235\nhttps://ve42.co/luminet\n\nUsing my every day intuition I wondered: will we see the \"shadow\" of the black hole even if we're looking edge on at the accretion disk? The answer is yes because the black hole warps space-time, so even if we wouldn't normally be able to see the back of the accretion disk, we can in this case because its light is bent up and over the black hole. Similarly we can see light from the bottom of the back of the accretion disk because it's bent under the bottom of the black hole. Plus there are additional images from light that does a half turn around the black hole leading to the inner rings.\n\nWhat about the black hole \"shadow\" itself? Well initially I thought it can't be an image of the event horizon because it's so much bigger (2.6 times bigger). But if you trace back the rays, you find that for every point in the shadow, there is a corresponding ray that traces back to the event horizon. So in fact from our one observing location, we see all sides of the event horizon simultaneously! In fact infinitely many of these images, accounting for the virtually infinite number of times a photon can orbit the black hole before falling in. The edge of the shadow is due to the photon sphere - the radius at which light goes around in closed orbits. If a light ray coming in at an oblique angle just skims the photon sphere and then travels on to our telescopes, that is the closest 'impact parameter' possible, and it occurs at sqrt(27)/2*r_s\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Geraint Lewis \nUniversity of Sydney https://ve42.co/gfl\nLike him, I'm hoping (predicting?) we'll see some moving images of black holes tomorrow\n\nProf. Rana Adhikari\nCaltech https://ve42.co/Rana\n\nRiccardo Antonelli - for excellent images of black holes, simulations and ray-tracing code, check out:\nhttps://ve42.co/rantonels\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration\nCheck out their resources and get your local link for the livestream here: https://ve42.co/EHT\n\nSpecial thanks to Patreon supporters:\nDonal Botkin, Michael Krugman, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Terrance Shepherd, Penward Rhyme\n\nFilming by Raquel Nuno\nAnimation by Maria Raykova",

Applications open June 1: http://bit.ly/2HkLXT1 This video was sponsored by Regeneron. The Science Talent Search was founded and produced by the Society for Science and the Public.\n\nHuge thanks to the students: Ronak Roy, Ana Humphrey, and Anjali Chadha. It was great getting to meet all of you and learn about your original scientific research.\n\nSpecial thanks to Assistant Professor Konstantin Batygin for discussing Ana's research and Planet 9 with me. More is coming on the Planet 9 front.\n\nRonak came up with a new design for the phoropter, the device used to determine eye-glass prescriptions. It's basically been unchanged for 200 years. Using a liquid lens, he miniaturized the device and wrote an algorithm to determine your prescription.\n\nAna used math and physics to search for hidden exoplanets. There are a number of reasons why the transit method and Kepler telescope may have missed them: they're too small, too inclined, or take too long to orbit and so were not seen. By considering which planetary systems have additional space for more planets, Ana came up with 560 locations where we may look again for planets in future.\n\nAnjali developed an internet enabled device for measuring arsenic concentrations in drinking water. The device performs several chemical reactions to release the arsenic into a measurable state. It then reacts the arsenic with a test strip to produce a color output. This color is sampled by a camera and processed to determine the concentration of arsenic in the water sample. This has significant potential applications around the world helping reduce exposure to arsenic and potentially other contaminants.\n\nFilming by Raquel Nuno",

      "description": "I took a boat through 96 million black plastic balls on the Los Angeles reservoir to find out why they're there. The first time I heard about shade balls the claim was they reduce evaporation. But it turns out this isn't the reason they were introduced.\n\nHuge thanks to LADWP for arranging this special tour for me. Next time let's put the GoPro on the submersible!\n\nThe balls are made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) which is less dense than water so they float on the surface of the reservoir even if they break apart. They are 10cm (4 inches) in diameter and contain about 210ml of water. So the main reason they are on the reservoir is to block sunlight from entering the water and triggering a chemical reaction that turns harmless bromide into carcinogenic bromate. This effect occurs with prolonged exposure to bromate so regulators insist that levels be kept below 10 microgram per liter on average over a 12 month period.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon supporters!

As the algorithm shifts, various YouTubers experience burnout (as what used to work no longer works) and right now click-through rate is the key metric. So clickable titles and thumbnails are the only way to get a lot of impressions and hence views - they are the only way to go viral. This leads me to wonder which audiences will become most prevalent on the site and if there will even be a place for educational content. In the long-term, hopefully YouTube is able to measure satisfaction through surveys and other metrics to ensure an optimal experience for everyone on the site.\n\nFlipchart artwork by Maria Raykova\nFilmed by Raquel Nuno\nThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci",

They appear to act like a non-Newtonian fluid: rigid under high shear stress, but they flow like a liquid under low shear.\nAll the signed shade balls have now been mailed out - thanks for your support!\n\nReceiving a shade ball:\n1. Support Veritasium on any Patreon tier and enter your address https://ve42.co/patreon\n2. In about a month I will send out signed shade balls\n3. I will cover all shipping costs but if things get really crazy I will prioritize existing Patreon supporters and higher tiers\n\nMy sense was that swimming in shade balls would be difficult but still doable. This was roughly true for the single layer of shade balls. The shade balls slide past each other so they act like a liquid, albeit a viscous one owing to their significant inertia. It's much more intense exercise and it's also annoying to be bombarded with shade balls on all sides of your body, particularly your head. With multi-layer shade balls (as exists on much of LA reservoir) things get significantly more difficult. The balls bunch together and when you try to move through them quickly, they become more rigid, providing significant resistance to motion. This has the benefit that you can lie on them and as long as they stay trapped under you, you can float on them. But a little bit of motion causes them to move around and you sink through quickly.\n\nSpecial thanks to our Patreon supporters!

The footage is amazing! https://www.flir.com\n\nAerogel\u2019s extraordinary properties are due in large part to its structure. Aerogel is a solid but on the nanoscale it has a mesh or sponge-like structure. The struts of this structure are nanoscale, as are the pores at around 20nm across. This makes silica aerogel incredibly light (it was once the lightest solid but has now been superseded by graphene aerogel), transparent and adsorbent. \n\nAn ice-cube sized piece of aerogel has an internal surface area roughly equal to half a football field. Aerogel is used in high end museum cases to regulate humidity. Plus it helps maintain the vacuum on the Mars Insight seismometers - it adsorbs moisture and other outgassed volatiles that come from the spacecraft itself. Proposed uses include as a physical insecticide by \u2018drying out insects\u2019 reducing the need for chemical and toxic pesticides.\n\nSpecial thanks to all my Patreon supporters especially those who contributed feedback to an earlier draft of this video:\na human, Albert Jachowicz-Brzezi\u0144ski, Alfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Brent Stewart, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, Clip Tree, Coale Shifflett, Colin Bellmore, DALE HORNE, Eric Velazquez, Fedor Indutny, Fran Rodriguez, James Wong, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Johnny, Jorge Angel Sandoval, June Kang, Kevin Beavers, Kishore Tipirneni, Levan Ferr, Listen Money Matters, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Mark Bevilacqua, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Michael Bradley Wirz, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Nicholas Hastings, OddJosh, Patrick \u010calija, Peter Tajti, Philipp Volgger, Roberto Rezende, Robin DeBank, Ron Neal, Stan Presolski, Swante Scholz, Tiago Bruno, Tige Thorman, Warrior8252\n\nFilmed by Paul Gramaglia\n\nThumbnail by Ignat Berbeci\n\nAnimations by Catherine Chooljian\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \u201cTonic Zone\u201d \u201cBetelgeuse\u201d \u201cInsidious Mice\u201d \u201cSeaweed\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that serious\u201d \u201cPlatin00m - Sum It\u201d\n\nThis is an educational, scientific video.",

Consider: Barringer Crater was claimed to be a meteorite impact site but geologists dismissed it as a volcanic formation.

This video was sponsored by BMW: https://www.bmwusa.com/\n\nFull disclosure: I drive an #electric #car. I think electric cars are the future, not mainly because they're better for the environment (which they are if you drive the car for any reasonable length of time) but because they are just better cars. The have better torque and acceleration, better handling, they're more efficient, quieter, they don't smell, they're cheaper to run and best of all you never have to visit a gas station - this appeals to me. I never have to worry about being low on gas because every morning my car is charged and ready to go - just like my phone and laptop. And if you're worried about range, don't. Almost all trips can already be done in an electric car with modest battery pack. And fast chargers along the way make it possible to do longer road trips if necessary. You have to make rest stops anyway, just time them with the charging. And consider that battery tech is getting dramatically cheaper, smaller, lighter. All these reasons are why I see the #future of cars as electric.\n\nWriting & Research\nDerek Muller\nJonny Hyman\nMatthew Shribman https://ve42.co/sciencebath\n\nEditing, Animation, Audio, & Music:\nJonny Hyman\n\nCamerawork:\nRaquel Nuno\nJonny Hyman\n\n 1890s Music \"National fantasie\" by William Paris Chambers, archived in Library of Congress\n#BMWUSA #NEXTGen #BMWPartner #ad",

It should detach and fly within the first 30-60 days of the mission. I learned a lot getting to visit the drone right before it was mounted on the rover at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.\n\nHow do you fly in 1% of Earth's atmosphere:\nHave large rotors (they are 1.2m in diameter) and spin them very fast, around 2500 RPM (5x the speed of a helicopter on Earth).\n\nPlus the aircraft has to be light:\nThe Mars helicopter weighs in at 1.8kg or around the same as a laptop. Every piece had to be stripped down for weight. Instead of using aerogel for insulation, the craft makes use of CO2 gaps between components. Even aerogel was too heavy!\n\nOne of the major challenges is surviving the Martian night:\nTemperatures plunge to -80C to -100C so two thirds of the craft's power is actually used to keep its electronics warm. Only one third is used for flying. The estimated flight time is 90 seconds.\n\nThe craft can't be driven remotely, it will have to fly autonomously, using its own sensor suite to determine how to fly. The round trip 20 minute delay with Earth means steering the craft from mission control would be impossible. \n\nHuge Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nPhilipp Volgger, Chris Vargas, Ron Neal, Alfred Wallace, Colin Bellmore, Michael Krugman, James Knight, Donal Botkin, Sam Lutfi, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Kevin Beavers, Chuck Lauer Vose, Bryan Baker, James Wong, kkm, Manuel Z\u00fcrcher, Tige Thorman, Jasper Xin, Leah Howard, Daniel Milum, Mathias G\u00f6ransson, Stan Presolski, Lyvann Ferrusca, Arjun Chakroborty, June Kang, Listen Money Matters, Pindex, Joar Wandborg, DALE HORNE, Parker Linn, Roberto Rezende\n\nJonny Hyman was a legend in editing, animation, filming, and sound design for this video.",

Order one here: https://starbucks.app.link/derekmuller\n\nMaking liquid nitrogen is hard - in fact up until 150 years ago scientists doubted whether it was even possible to liquefy nitrogen. In 1823, At the royal institution in London, Michael Faraday first produced liquid chlorine, kind of accidentally by putting it under high pressure. He similarly liquefied ammonia.\n\nBorrowing a mixture from Thilorier in France, a combination of dry ice, snow and ether, he reached a temperature of -110C. By 1845 he used this mixture plus a hand pump to pressurize gases to liquefy all the known gases except six, which included oxygen and nitrogen. These became known as the \u201cpermanent\u201d gases.\n\nA French Physicist Aim\u00e9 compressed oxygen and nitrogen in tanks and then lowered them into the ocean over 1.6km deep, where the pressure got up to 200 atmospheres. Still the gases didn\u2019t liquefy.\n\nOnly at the end of 1877 were the first droplets of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen produced, by Cailletet in France. He first tried oxygen by compressing it up to 300 atmospheres, cooled to -30C, but that wasn't even enough to liquefy oxygen. But when he suddenly released the pressure, the expanding gas cooled, he estimated to -200C and he saw a mist and then droplets slide down the walls of his vessel.\n\nIt's amazing how far we've come in that now I can purchase a helium-based cryocooler. It compresses and expands the gas to absorb heat from the tip of the cold finger and eject it into the surroundings at ambient temperature.",

      "description": "A planet has been predicted to orbit the sun with a period of 10,000 years, a mass 5x that of Earth on a highly elliptical and inclined orbit. What evidence supports the existence of such a strange object at the edge of our solar system?\n\nHuge thanks to:\nProf. Konstantin Batygin, Caltech\nProf. David Jewitt, UCLA\n\nI had heard about Planet 9 for a long time but I wondered what sort of evidence could support the bold claim: a planet at the very limits of our ability to detect one, so far out that its period is over 60 times that of Neptune. The planet 9 hypothesis helps explain clustering of orbits of distant Kuiper belt objects. It also explains how some of these objects have highly inclined orbits - up to 90 degrees relative to the plane of the solar system. Some are orbiting in reverse. Plus their orbits are removed from the orbit of Neptune, the logical option for a body that could have ejected them out so far. The fact that the perihelion is so far out suggests another source of gravity was essential for their peculiar orbits.\n\nSpecial Thanks to Patreon Supporters:\nAlfred Wallace, Arjun Chakroborty, Bryan Baker, Chris Vargas, Chuck Lauer Vose, DALE HORNE, Donal Botkin, Eric Velazquez, halyoav, James Knight, Jasper Xin, Joar Wandborg, Kevin Beavers, kkm, Leah Howard, Lyvann Ferrusca, Michael Krugman, Mohammed Al Sahaf, Noel Braganza, Pindex, Ron Neal, Sam Lutfi, Stan Presolski, Tige Thorman\n\nMusic from http://epidemicsound.com \"Observations - From Now On\" \"Magnified XY\"",

In fact, this is a strict inequality - if the energy is highest possible, there are no other possible combinations of momenta other than L2=L3=0, and vice versa for if the energy is the lowest possible.\n\nBecause of this, in the case of axis 1 the energy is so high that there simply aren't any other possible combinations of angular momentum components L1, L2 and L3 - the object would have to lose energy in order to spin differently. And in the case of axis 3, the energy is so low that there likewise is no way for the object to be rotating other than purely around axis 3 - it would have to gain energy. However, there's no such constraint for axis 2, since the energy is somewhere in between the min and max possible. This, together with the centrifugal effects, means that the components of momentum DO change.",

Start listening with a 30-day trial and your first audiobook, plus two Audible Originals free when you go to https://audible.com/veritasium or text veritasium to 500500\n\nHuge thanks to:\nDr. Robert Lang https://langorigami.com\nProf. Larry Howell https://www.compliantmechanisms.byu.edu/\n\nOn first glance it's surprising that origami -- a centuries old art of folding paper to achieve particular aesthetics -- is applicable to engineering. But upon closer consideration there are a lot of reasons methods developed for paper folding are also applicable to engineering: origami allows you to take a flat sheet of material and convert it to almost any shape only by folding. Plus for large flat structures, origami provides a way of shrinking dimensions while ensuring simply deployment - this is particularly useful for solar arrays in space applications. Furthermore, motions designed to take advantage of the flexibility of paper can also be used to form compliant mechanisms for engineering like the kaleidocycle. Since the principles of origami are scalable, mechanisms can also be dramatically miniaturized.\n\nSome of the work shown is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research under Grant No. EFRI-ODISSEI-1240417.

I hope this video gives an idea of phase space - a picture of dynamical systems in which each point completely represents the state of the system. For a pendulum, phase space is only 2-dimensional and you can get orbits (in the case of an undamped pendulum) or an inward spiral (in the case of a pendulum with friction). For the Lorenz equations we need three dimensions to show the phase space. The attractor you find for these equations is said to be strange and chaotic because there is no loop, only infinite curves that never intersect. This explains why the motion is so unpredictable - two different initial conditions that are very close together can end up arbitrarily far apart.\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"The Longest Rest\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"",

      "description": "Scientists like Prof Sinclair have evidence of speeding up, slowing, and even reversing aging. \nThanks to LastPass for sponsoring this video. Click here to start using LastPass: https://ve42.co/VeLP\n\nWhat causes aging? According to Professor David Sinclair, it is a loss of information in our epigenome, the system of proteins like histones and chemical markers like methylation that turn on and off genes. Epigenetics allow different cell types to perform their specific functions - they are what differentiate a brain cell from a skin cell. Our DNA is constantly getting broken, by cosmic rays, UV radiation, free radicals, x-rays and regular cell division etc. When our cells repair that damage, the epigenome is not perfectly reset. And hence over time, noise accumulates in our epigenome. Our cells no longer perform their functions well. \n\nTo counter this decline, we can activate the body's own defenses against aging by stressing the body. Eat less, eat less protein, engage in intense exercise, experience uncomfortable cold. When the body senses existential threats it triggers longevity genes, which attempt to maintain the body to ensure its survival until good times return. This may be the evolutionary legacy of early bacteria, which established these two modes of living (repair and protect vs grow and reproduce). Scientists are uncovering ways to mimic stresses on the body without the discomfort of fasting. Molecules like NMN also trigger sirtuins to monitor and repair the epigenome. This may slow aging.\n\nReversing aging requires an epigenetic reset, which may be possible using Yamanaka factors. These four factors can revert an adult cell into a pluripotent stem cell. Prof. Sinclair used three of the four factors to reverse aging in the retinal cells of old mice. He found they could see again after the treatment.\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProfessor David Sinclair, check out his book \"Lifespan: Why We Age & Why We Don't Have To\"\nAssistant Professor David Gold\nNoemie Sierra (for polyp images)\nGenepool Productions for telomere animations from Immortal: https://ve42.co/immortal\nEpigenetics animations (DNA, histones, methylation etc) courtesy of: http://wehi.tv\nAnimation: Etsuko Uno\nArt and Technical Direction: Drew Berry\nSound Design: Francois Tetaz & Emma Bortignon\nScientific Consultation: Marnie Blewitt\nCourtesy of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research\n\nFilming, editing and animation by Jonny Hyman and Derek Muller\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Clearer Views\" \"Innovations\" \"A Sound Foundation\" \"Seaweed\"\nAdditional music by Kevin MacLeod from https://incompetech.com \"Marty Gots a Plan\"",

Get up to 60% off the first year (annually billed) here: https://bit.ly/32SM0yd or use promo code VERITASIUM\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Sean Carroll https://www.preposterousuniverse.com\nHis book, a major source for this video is 'Something Deeply Hidden: Quantum Worlds and The Emergence of Spacetime'\n\nCode for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by Jonny Hyman available here: https://github.com/jonnyhyman/QuantumWaves\n\nI learned quantum mechanics the traditional 'Copenhagen Interpretation' way. We can use the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to solve for and evolve wave functions. Then we invoke wave-particle duality, in essence things we detect as particles can behave as waves when they aren't interacting with anything. But when there is a measurement, the wave function collapses leaving us with a definite particle detection. If we repeat the experiment many times, we find the statistics of these results mirror the amplitude of the wave function squared. Hence the Born rule came into being, saying the wave function should be interpreted statistically, that our universe at the most fundamental scale is probabilistic rather than deterministic. This did not sit well with scientists like Einstein and Schr\u00f6dinger who believed there must be more going on, perhaps 'hidden variables'.\n\nIn the 1950's Hugh Everett proposed the Many Worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. It is so logical in hindsight but with a bias towards the classical world, experiments and measurements to guide their thinking, it's understandable why the founders of quantum theory didn't come up with it. Rather than proposing different dynamics for measurement, Everett suggests that measurement is something that happens naturally in the course of quantum particles interacting with each other. The conclusion is inescapable. There is nothing special about measurement, it is just the observer becoming entangled with a wave function in a superposition. Since one observer can experience only their own branch, it appears as if the other possibilities have disappeared but in reality there is no reason why they could not still exist and just fail to interact with the other branches. This is caused by environmental decoherence.\n\nSchrodinger's cat animation by Ivy Tello\nWave functions, double slit and entanglement animation by Jonny Hyman\nFilming of opening sequence by Casey Rentz\n\nSpecial thanks to Mithuna Y, Raquel Nuno and Dianna Cowern for feedback on the script\n\nMusic from https://epidemicsound.com \"Experimental 1\" \"Serene Story 2\" \"Seaweed\" \"Colorful Animation 4\"",

      "description": "Everyone loves laminar flow but turbulent flow is the real MVP. \nA portion of this video was sponsored by Cottonelle. Purchase Cottonelle Flushable Wipes and try them for yourself: https://bit.ly/2WJm9Hq\n\nSpecial thanks to:\nProf. Beverley McKeon and team https://www.mckeon.caltech.edu\nDestin from Smarter Every Day https://www.youtube.com/smartereveryday\nNicole Sharp from FYFD https://ve42.co/fyfd\nPavol Dobryakov turbulent simulations: https://paveldogreat.github.io/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation/\n\nI got into turbulent flow via chaos. The transition to turbulence sometimes involves a period doubling. Turbulence itself is chaotic motion, it is unpredictable and sensitively dependent on initial conditions. What surprised me is all the ways turbulent flow is useful to us. It is diffusive, meaning it causes mixing. This is useful in jet engines or rocket nozzles (which Destin studies) and is important to achieve in microfluidic devices, which are so small that turbulent flow is actually difficult to achieve. Turbulent flow can energize a boundary layer, which is important to maintain flow attachment over a wing, maintaining lift and delaying stall. Similarly a turbulent boundary layer over a golf ball reduces pressure drag allowing golf balls to fly further. This is the reason for the dimples on golf balls. Flow transitioning to turbulence in the wake of a bluff body can create periodic vortex shedding. This beautiful phenomenon can be seen in the von K\u00e0rm\u00e0n vortex street in clouds viewed from space. Turbulence is everywhere, in the air currents in a room, in your aorta, in the breaths you exhale, in oil pipelines and water pipes, in the flow over cars and ships and planes. Animals have evolved for it (like dead fish swimming up stream) and we have engineered our environment, our planes and golf balls for it. Laminar flow may be nice to look at (which is why we use it in decorative fountains) but turbulent flow does the real lifting.\n\nAnimations by:\nJonny Hyman (Sun, Jupiter, Reynolds, airfoil, Earth time-lapse)\n\nResearch and writing:\nAJ Fillo and Derek Muller.

Learn more about Search here: https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/\n\nSpecial thanks to J.M.E.H van Bronswijk, author of 'House Dust Biology'. We exchanged emails to make sure I got my facts straight for this video. Below is an excerpt from her email to me, responding to my claims that start with a dash:\n\n- Around half of airborne dust particles under 100um are skin scales\nThis is true for climates, regions and seasons where people live mostly indoors.\nThe 1 to 2 g of skin scales shed each 24 hours will end up in places where people are present (and rub their skin or have textile moving over the skin).\nYou can also look at it from a different angle: What else has the same size and could contribute? That will usually be pollen from outdoor sources, also depending on season, region and climate, as well as the ventilation regime of the building.\nHowever, taken as the median value over a whole year, I consider your statement correct for regions with a temperate climate.\n\n- 53% of dust particles vacuumed from a mattress were found to be skin scales\nIt depends a little on the type of mattress. For polyether mattresses the amount may even be larger.\nFor mattresses made of natural material it could be less since the mattress-material will also give off small particles.\n\n- larger particles consist mostly of fibers, eg. cotton, paper, wool, synthetics\nThat's true .. including bread crumbs ..... \ud83d\ude42\n\n- skin scales seem to form a larger fraction of dust where we spend more time, e.g. in or near bed.\n..... and on the couch used to view television or be active in gaming.\nIt has to do with the constant production of skin scales over the 24 hours.\n\n- skin scales form a smaller fraction of dust if there are significant other sources, e.g. carpeting, dirt from outside etc.\nYes, everyting you walk on with your shoes or that recieves dirt from the outside with other means, will have a lessr percentage of human skin scales.\nHowever, do not forget the skin scales of pets that will also be an active allergen for many people, and a food source for house dust mites.\n\nInformation on dust particle size \u00a9ISO.

Check out http://kiwico.com/Veritasium50 for 50% off your first month of any subscription!\n\nOn Thursday February 18th, 2021 the NASA Perseverance Rover will land on Mars. It is a wonderful robot, made out of steel and wire \u2014 but will future robots look like Perseverance? There is an emerging field of  research on \"soft robots\", where the machines are flexible. These soft robots have many advantages over traditional robots \u2014 they're safer, lighter, more flexible and can change their shape and size.\n\nNASA is investigating the use of soft robots for space missions. For future visits to Enceladus or Europa, a lander could cut a hole in the ice and then insert a compliant robot through the hole. This robot could then grow and change shape on the other side.\n\nReferences:\nN. S. Usevitch, Z. M. Hammond, M. Schwager, A. M. Okamura, E. W. Hawkes, S.

If you hit a tennis ball with a racket, a wave has to travel from the strings to your hand before you feel it - and the ball is well on its way to the net by this time. If you hit a golf ball, the ball is well on its way to the hole before you can feel it. Rigid bodies aren't truly rigid and understanding this is essential to understanding the way the world works",
