      "description": "Two boats make a round trip from opposite shores of a lake. They meet and pass at 500 units from the left shore, then at 300 units from the right shore. The boats move at a constant speed and turn around instantly from the shores. What is the distance between the shores? What is the ratio of the speeds of the boats? It seems impossible to solve, but with logical deduction you can solve it with minimum calculation! This problem is adapted from \"Moscow Puzzles\" number 227.

There are other types of geometries where triangle angles sum to more or less than 180 degrees (in hyperbolic geometry, there would similarly be infinitely many such lines, and a triangle's angles sum to less than 180 degrees.
