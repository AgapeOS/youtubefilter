      "description": "Zero the Hero helps kids exercise and learn to count to 100. This is a great song to engage your children in movement and practice counting to 100.  This song is perfect to have some Zero the Hero fun to celebrate 100 days of school. This is our ASL version of Zero the Hero.\nThis count to 100 song features the popular fictional character Zero the Hero who flies in with Zeros so children can count beyond the number 9. Zero the Hero places the zero (0) to hold the place for the tens (10's), hundreds (100's), thousands (1,000's) and on to infinity. Wow, those zeroes are important! Zero the Hero is a big, cool, super character that helps make math fun. At your school or home, anyone can dress up a little bit and have fun with playing the part of Zero the Hero.\nTeachers and parents all over the world do dress up as Zero the Hero to help children understand how important those zeros (0's) are to hold the place for numbers to go beyond single digit numbers.\nSo, count to 100 and follow Zero the Hero while exercising, getting smarter, stronger and healthier.\nJust for your information, I wrote this song, but our count to 100 Zero the Hero character, is played by our friend Mark. He was a good sport to do this, and is a really great guy. By the way, he really is that big! He bench presses almost 500 lbs, dose curls with 200 lbs, has 22 inch biceps and works out 2 hrs a day five days a week ! He's also a stay at home dad with 6 children. Wow! \nHave fun exercising with Zero the Hero and learning to count to 100.\n  Pamela Mascitto's passion for providing equal access for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing people has led her to become a K-12 sign language interpreter for thirteen years, working at schools both in Hawai'i, where she grew up, and in Texas, where she lives currently. She has a degree in Educational Interpreting from Kapi'olani Community College and has both a National Interpreter Certification from the Registry of Interpreters for the Deaf (NIC) and a Board for Evaluation of Interpreters Advanced Certification (BEI).\nLyrics\nHe's got big muscles, a cool cape\nHe can fly any place\nWhen we count numbers\nHe flies in, pumps up a zero on every 10\n\nHe's Zero the Hero\nAfter number 9, he always arrives\nHe's Zero the Hero\nLet's count with zero and exercise\n\nReach up and count\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nOne set of 10\n10\n\nArm circles and count\n11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nTwo sets of 10\n20\n\nArm curls and count\n21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nThree sets of 10\n30\n\n\nTwist and count\n31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nFour sets of 10\n40\n\nMarch and count\n41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nFive sets of 10\n50\n\nSwim and count\n51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nSix sets of 10\n60\n\nClap high and count\n61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nSeven sets of 10\n70\n\nFly and count\n71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nEight sets of 10\n80\n\nLeg squats and count\n81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nNine sets of 10\n90\n\nCross step and count\n91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99\nZero flies in pumps up a zero\nTen sets of 10\n100\n\nHe's Zero the Hero\nEveryday he keeps numbers in place\nHe's Zero the Hero\nHe's so smart and strong\nHe helps us count on and on and on and on and on\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann",

      "description": "Jack Hartmann's \"Ridin' On the Bus\" is a fun upbeat twist on the popular children's classic song,           \" The Wheels on the Bus.\" \nInstead of the more negative actions on the bus like babies crying in the original version, we have the babies having more fun and playing Peek -a -Boo! \nYour children will really enjoy singing and moving to all the interesting characters on the bus and follow their actions and words. This song will truly engage your children with lots of singing, laughing and moving their bodies. This is a great song for sequencing and allowing students to remember and name the order of the different characters on the bus.\n  As an extension activity follow up, discuss what characters the children remember, and which character is their favorite. This activity can help build memory and comprehension skills. Your children may also have fun drawing a picture of their favorite character and say why it is their favorite. This activity really help hand/ eye coordination and fine motor coordination. Extend this activity even more by asking children if they can say the order of the different characters. This activity can help with developing awareness of ordering and sequencing which are important skills to strengthen in young children.\n  It's one of those songs for Pre-K and Kindergarten that when it's done you'll hear, \"Can we do it again?\" Great for circle time and anytime during the day when you need to get some wiggles out as a brain break for building bodies and brains.\n\nRidin' On the Bus\nRidin' on the bus\nRidin' on the bus\nWe're all having fun\nRidin' On the Bus\nThe cowboys on the bus go \"Yippee Ki Yay\"\n\"Yippee Ki Yay\"\n\"Yippee Ki Yay\"\nThe cowboys on the bus go \"Yippee Ki Yay\"\nAll through the town\nThe magicians on the bus go \"Abracadabra\"\n\"Abracadabra\"\n\"Abracadabra\"\nThe magicians on the bus go \"Abracadabra\"\nAll through the town\nThe divers on the bus go \"Swim down deep\"\n\"Swim down deep in the deep blue sea\"\nThe divers on the bus go \"Swim down deep\"\nAll through the town\nThe ballerinas on the bus go \"Tippy, tippy toe\"\n\"Tippy, tippy toe\"\n\"Tippy, tippy toe\"\nThe ballerinas on the bus go \"Tippy, tippy toe\"\nRidin' On the Bus\nRidin' on the bus\nRidin' on the bus\nWe're all having fun\nRidin' On the Bus\nThe body builders on the bus go \"Pump it up\"\n\"Pump it up\"\n\"Pump it up\"\nThe body builders on the bus go \"Pump it up\"\nAll through the town\nThe little babies on the bus go \"Peek a boo\"\n\"Peek a boo\"\n\"Peek a boo\"\nThe little babies on the bus go \"Peek a boo\"\nAll through the town\nThe fishermen on the bus go \"I caught a big fish\"\n\"I caught a huge fish\"\n\"It's a monster fish'\nThe fishermen on the bus go \"I caught a big fish\"\nAll through the town\nThe Grandparents on the bus go \"I feel a little tired\"\n\"I feel a little tired\"\n\"Just a little peace and quiet\"\nThe Grandparents on the bus go \"I feel a little tired\"\nAll through the town\nRidin' On the Bus\nRidin' on the bus\nRidin' on the bus\nWe're all having fun\nRidin' On the Bus\nWe're all having fun\nRidin' On the Bus\n\n\n\nI\u2019ve Got Music in Me: \nhttp://www.jackhartmann.com/ive-got-music-in-me-mp3/\nhttp://www.jackhartmann.com/ive-got-music-in-me-cd/\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann bus song wheels on the bus go round and round",

What Word Makes Sense engages students in listening comprehension utilizing context cues and rhyming words.  What Word Makes Sense engages students in active learning and participation while building body and brain connections.\nCloze sentences are sentences in which keywords are deleted, covered up or blocked out. When presented with cloze sentences, students must use context clues to determine the missing word. Cloze sentences are also an engaging way to reinforce vocabulary and  language skills.\n\n\nWhat Word Makes Sense?\nEverybody sing a little country song\nAll about the animals on the farm\nWhen I leave out a word just do your best\nAnd sing out loud what word makes sense\nThat's right\nThere's a pig whose name is Bud\nHe rolls and plays right in the ___________.\nmud\nThere's a cow whose name is Sue\nShe eats the grass and when says ___________.\nmoo\nThere's a horse that loves to play\nWhen in the barn she eats her ___________.\nhay\nThere's some ducks out in the back\nThey waddle to me and then say __________.\nquack\n Everybody sing a little country song\nAll about the animals on the farm\nWhen I leave out a word just do your best\nAnd sing out loud what word makes sense\nI see a bunny whose ears just flop\nHe eats carrots and loves to _________.\nhop\nI see a little skunk run quick as a wink\nJust hold your nose sometimes they __________.\nstink\nI see a dog drink from a pail\nWhen he's real happy he wags his _________.\ntail\nThee sheep are now so big and full\nThat Farmer John can sheer their __________.\nwool\nEverybody sing a little country song\nAll about the animals on the farm\nWhen I leave out a word just do your best\nAnd sing out loud what word makes sense\nAnd sing out loud what word makes sense\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2020\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Jack Hartmann's original song Crossover is a fun Brain break song that is all about cross lateral movements. Cross lateral movements are movements that cross the midline of the brain.The midline is an imaginary line that runs down the middle of the body from head to toes, dividing the body into right and left halves. When children do cross - lateral movements the two sides of the brain are forced to communicate and strengthen the brain pathways. Brain Breaks  should be fun and movement oriented. My brain breaks song Crossover,  also gets children to immediately use their brain to concentrate and use different parts of their body to cross the midline. Crossing the midline activities promote communication between the two hemispheres of the brain.  \n\nCrossover tells children exactly what part of the body to crossover from right to left and left to right. Crossover is very easy for children of all ages to do in the regular classroom and at PE.\n\nCrossing the midline is necessary for reading and writing as we go left to right. When we engage children in crossover movements blood flow is increased in all parts of the brain making it more alert and energized for optimal learning.\n\nUse this song as a great musical brain breaks activity for stimulating the brain and body.\n\nLYRICS:\nCrossover\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann, MA  BMI  Copyright 2008\n\nRight hand to your left shoulder\nLeft hand to your right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to your left knee\nLeft hand to the right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to the left elbow\nLeft hand to the right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nCrossover as you walk\nArms left then to the right\nCrossover as you stretch\nReach out side to side\nCrossover, as you move\nTwist left then to the right\nCrossover builds your body and brain \nAnd helps you read and write\n\nRight hand to your left ear\nLeft hand to the right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to your left foot\nLeft hand to your right\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nRight hand to your friend\u2019s right\nLeft hand to their left\nCrossover, crossover everyday\nCrossover will build your body and brain\n\nCrossover as you walk\nArms left then to the right\nCrossover as you stretch\nReach out side to side\nCrossover, as you move\nTwist left then to the right\nCrossover builds your body and brain \nAnd helps you read and write\n\nExerSongs: https://www.jackhartmann.com/album/physical-education-exersongs/\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2020\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Daytime and Nighttime by Jack Hartmann introduces the concept of night and day. This interactive teaching tool will engage students in active learning participation as they choose between daytime and nighttime activities. Lessons about the sun can include information about how it affects light and darkness, as well as human and animal activity. Learning about nighttime and daytime works as a precursor to introducing students to calendars and other methods of tracking time.\n\nIn Daytime and Nighttime students learn to understand the concept of night and day and recognize the pattern of the day and night cycle.  By listing out the activities that they perform in the daytime and at night, students learn that their daily activities follow the day and night cycle. The concept  of daytime and nighttime is reinforced by the visual representation of day and night using the sun and moon. \nThe priority is to get students noticing and describing what objects in the sky look like at different times in the daytime sky and night sky.\nDaytime and Nighttime by Jack Hartmann encourages students classify daytime or nighttime activities, to  observe and describe what the sky looks like at different times; to identify objects in the sky and recognize changes over time; to look for objects that are common to the daytime and nighttime sky.\n\nLyrics\nDaytime and Nighttime by Jack Hartmann\nEverybody listen to what I say\nThen you think, and tell me if it's in the daytime or nighttime\nWhen does the sun rise?\nIn the daytime\nWhen does a rooster crow?\nIn the daytime\nWhen do the owls hoot?\nIn the nighttime\nWhen do the stars shine bright?\nIn the nighttime\nDaytime is when the sky is light\nNighttime is when the sky is dark\nWhen does the mailman come?\nIn the daytime\nWhen does the moon shine bright?\nIn the nighttime\nWhen do you go to bed?\nIn the nighttime\nWhen can you see fireworks?\nIn the nighttime\nDaytime is when the sky is light\nNighttime is when the sky is dark\nWhen can you see a rainbow?\nIn the daytime\nWhen do you go to school?\nIn the daytime\nWhen does the wolf howl?\nIn the nighttime\nWhen do you go to lunch?\nIn the daytime\nDaytime is when the sky is light\nNighttime is when the sky is dark\n\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2020\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Addition and Subtraction by Jack Hartmann introduces  the operations of addition and subtraction.\nAddition is adding 2 or more number and getting a greater number or sum. Subtraction is taking away to get the difference. Jack Hartmann introduces simple addition and subtraction word problems to show each operation. There is a special rule at the end for adding and subtracting zero to a number in this Addition and Subtraction video by Jack Hartmann.  Addition and subtraction word problems.  \n\nAddition and Subtraction Lyrics\n\nWhen you add you put together\nWhen you add you get the sum\nIt's taking 2 or more numbers and getting a greater one\nAdding is called addition\nWhen you subtract you take away\nWhen you subtract you get the difference\nIt's taking one number from another and always getting less\nSubtracting is called subtraction\nLet's try an adding problem I think you can solve\nIf you have 3 pencils,     3\nAnd you add 2 more pencils    2\nHow many pencils do you have all together?\n3 + 2 = 5\nLet's try another adding problem, I think you can get it\nIf you have 2 dogs          2\nAnd you add 2 more dogs      2\nHow many dogs do you have all together\n1,2,3,4\n2 + 2= 4\nLet's try a subtracting problem I think you can solve\nIf you have 4 balls     4\nAnd you subtract 2 balls     2\nHow many balls do you have left?\n1,2\n4 - 2 = 2\n Let's try another subtracting problem\nThink, you can do it\nIf you have 6 apples     6\nAnd you subtract 3 apples     3\nHow many apples  do you have left?\n1,2,3\n6 - 3 = 3\nNow listen to this cool rule about number 0\nWhen you add or subtract  0 the number doesn't change\nWhen you add or subtract 0 the number stays the same\nWhen you add you put together\nWhen you add you get the sum\nIt's taking 2 or more numbers and getting a greater one\nAdding is called addition\nWhen you subtract you take away\nWhen you subtract you get the difference\nIt's taking one number from another and always getting less\nSubtracting is called subtraction\n\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

This version of Jump Out Words has Jack spelling and saying the jump out word twice as students repeat  the jump out word each time.\nThis song will have children having fun as they learn these sight words!\n\nJump Out Words Lyrics\n\nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them         \nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them\n\nWhen I read from left to right\nSome words just jump out in my mind\nThey help me read really cool\nThey help me read nice and smooth\n\nLet's learn some jump out words right now\nAnd work our body out\nRoll your arms like a wheel spell and say the sight word\na-l-l           all\ni-f              if             \na-n            an\nc-a-n         can\na-m           am\nu-s             us\n\nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them         \nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them\n\nShake, shake your hips spell and say the sight word\n\nm-e               me\ni-s                  is\nm-y               my\ng-e-t              get\nd-i-d              did\ng-o                go\na                   a\nI                    I\n\nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them         \nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them\nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them         \nJump out words, when I see them\nJump out words, I know them\n\n\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "New ABC Lullaby by Jack Hartmann is a slower paced alphabet song that separates the letters in a new way in order to emphasize individual letters.  The letters are separated and grouped differently from the standard alphabet song. This version does not group l,m,n,o,p together to avoid the letters running together and sounding like one letter.  The first time through lower case letters are presented. The second time through Upper Case letters are presented. The final time both the Upper and lower case letters are shown together in this ABC song for kids.  \n\n\nABC Lullaby Lyrics \na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nf\ng\nh\ni\nj\nk\nl\nm\nn\no\np\nq\nr\ns\nt\nu\nv\nw\nx\ny\nz\nNow I never will forget, how to say the alphabet\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\nM\nN\nO\nP\nQ\nR\nS\nT\nU\nV\nW\nX\nY\nZ\nNow I never will forget, how to say the alphabet\nAa\nBb\nCc\nDd\nEe\nFf\nGg\nHh\nIi\nJj\nKk\nLl\nMm\nNn\nOo\nPp\nQq\nRr\nSs\nTt\nUu\nVv\nWw\nXx \nYy\nZz\nNow I never will forget, how to say the alphabet\nLearning the alphabet A to Z will help me write and help me read\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Make a Rhyme, Make a Move  by Jack Hartmann helps develop rhyming skills and phonological awareness (hearing the parts in words). This  rhyming song  engages your children with movement, dance, and most importantly an opportunity to practice their awareness of words that rhyme. This song really makes rhyming fun which is so important in learning for young children. The ability to know when words rhyme is an essential listening and language skill for all children.  Many studies have shown that children who have developed their ability to know when words rhyme will have a better chance of becoming successful readers. Offering your children many opportunities to hear and practice rhyming will give them a better chance of becoming lifelong readers.\nMake a Rhyme, Make a Move is a great song to use regularly to allow your children to really have   fun learning about rhyming.  This song presents two words, and children have a chance to listen and decide if the words rhyme or not. If the words rhyme then they do a cool Hip \u2013Hop dance, and if the words don\u2019t rhyme they get a chance to move and say - No way, no way.\n Listening for the parts of sounds in words at the beginning, middle and ending really helps children develop their phonological awareness (hearing the parts of words) skills so important in becoming a successful reader.\nMake a Rhyme, Make a Move will really help make learning about rhyming fun for all your children.\n Make a Rhyme, Make a Move includes Jack Hartmann and Rachel Smith singing together. Both Rachel and Jack show your children the different moves and dances they can do. And, this rhyming song features rhyming that is simple and easy to follow. Students are actively engaged in learning as they decide if the words rhyme or don't rhyme.\nStudies show that having the ability to recognize and be aware of words that rhyme is a good predictor of future successful reading in the future.\nHelp make rhyming fun for your children and sing, dance and listen for those rhymes! \n\nMake a Rhyme, Make a Move Lyrics copyright\u00a9 by Jack Hartmann\n\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nYou can do it \n I can too \nLet's go! \n\nMake a rhyme, make a move\nDo it to the beat\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nHave some fun with me  \n\nWhen the two words rhyme make a move like this \nTwo thumbs up, crisscross\nSay that rhymes\nThat rhymes \nWhen the words don\u2019t rhyme\nMake a move like this \nOne arm out front, back and forth \nSay no way\nNo way  \nYou got it \n\ncat - hat   \nThat rhymes \ndog \u2013 frog   \nThat rhymes  \ncan \u2013 mat \nNo way (2x)\nPig \u2013 dig   \nThat rhymes (2x) \nBoat \u2013 car \nNo way  (2x)\nPlay \u2013 day  \nThat rhymes (2x)\n\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nYou can do it \n I can too \nLet's go! \n\nMake a rhyme, make a move\nDo it to the beat\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nHave some fun with me  \n\nBug \u2013 hug  \nThat rhymes (2x) \nTeacher \u2013 preacher  \nThat rhymes (2x) \nHouse \u2013 truck \nNo way (2x)\nHouse \u2013 mouse  \nThat rhymes (2x)\nTree \u2013 me  \nThat rhymes (2x) \nEgg \u2013 chicken   \nNo way (2x) \nMake a rhyme make a move\nYou can do it\nRhyme and move\nMake a rhyme, make a move\nDo it to the beat\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nHave some fun with me \n Make a rhyme, make a move\nDo it to the beat\nMake a rhyme, make a move \nHave some fun with me  \nRhyming words is cool\nAnd you can do it too boys and girls\nIf the end of words sound the same\nThen they rhyme\nYou can do it!\nYeah, you got it!\nI love to rhyme!\nI do too Markie\nRhyming is fun anytime, anywhere\nYou got it!\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "ABC Lullaby Evenly Paced A-Zed Version by Jack Hartmann is a slower paced alphabet song that separates the letters in an original way Jack Hartmann created in order to emphasize individual letters. Each letter has the approximately the same amount of time on the screen. The letters are separated and grouped differently from the standard alphabet song. This version does not group l, m, n, o, p together to avoid the letters running together and sounding like one letter.  The first time through lower case letters are presented. The second time through Upper Case letters are presented. The final time both the Upper and lower case letters are shown together in this ABC song for kids.  This version is one in a series of three different ways to practice the alphabet.

Lyrics\nI'm so excited\nI'm smiling ear to ear\nIt's the Halloween time of year\nEveryday I like being me with my friends\nBut on Halloween it's fun to pretend\nI use my imagination and see\nWhat do I want to be?\nI might be an astronaut blasting into space\nThen walking on the moon slow motion pace\nI might be a dancer dancing in a show\nTwirling, swirling, feel the music flow\nI might be a superhero flying way up high\nHelping lots of people and making them smile\nI might be a puppy dog wagging my tail\nAnd flopping my ears walking down the trail\nI'm so excited\nI'm smiling ear to ear\nIt's the Halloween time of year\nEveryday I like being me with my friends\nBut on Halloween it's fun to pretend\nI use my imagination and see\nWhat do I want to be?\nI might be a monster stomping on the ground\nAnd growling with a mighty sound\nI might be a surfer saying, \"Hey Dude\"\nRiding on the waves, being really cool\nI might be a body builder pumping my muscles up\nGetting stronger and stronger and never giving up\nI might be a Grandma or Grandpa walking with a cane\nWith gray hair and glasses and 100 years of age\nI wonder, I wonder, what do I want to be\nI could be an astronaut\nI could be a dancer\nI could be a superhero\nI could be a puppy dog\nI could be a monster\nI could be a surfer\nI could be a body builder\nI could be a Grandma and Grandpa\nNow you think quietly\nWhat do you want to be?\nI'm so excited\nI'm smiling ear to ear\nIt's the Halloween time of year\nEveryday I like being me with my friends\nBut on Halloween it's fun to pretend\nI use my imagination and see\nWhat do I want to be?\nI'll use my imagination and see\nWhat do I want to be?\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Punctuation Power by Jack Hartmann is about how punctuation is such a powerful part of writing and reading. Punctuation Power tells us we use a period in a statement to make a full stop for a complete thought. Punctuation Power explains that a question mark is used to get information when you are wondering about something. We use an explanation point to show strong emotion or when something is great or awesome. We use a comma to pause or separate items in a sentence.  Use the power of punctuation to make your writing powerful! \n\n\nPunctuation Power Lyrics\nWhen you read and write, you\u2019ve got all kinds of power\nI\u2019ve got punctuation power   \nPeriod\nPunctuation power                   \nQuestion Mark\nPunctuation power                   \nExclamation Point             \nPunctuation power                   \nComma\nI use the power to read and write\nI punctuate to get it right\n\nPunctuations are just like signs\nThat you follow when you read each time\nThey guide you and show you what to do\nPause, stop and show the meaning too  \nCheck it out!\n\nA period\u2019s used to make a full stop\nAfter a statement you put a dot\nPower!

      "description": "The Braille Alphabet With Alphabetic Word Signs by Jack Hartmann and Jessica Hayes MS ED was developed to assist  students with visual impairments and their families learn the Braille Alphabet and their corresponding word signs. Each letter of the alphabet has a corresponding word sign. The letters of the alphabet when they are standing alone have a corresponding word sign. For example In Braille when you read the letter k, it can make the /k/ sound when part of a word. It represents the word knowledge when it is standing alone with a space on either side. In this song, we are representing the Alphabetic Braille Word Signs. Most of the letter of the alphabet have a corresponding alphabetic word sign. The letter 'a' stand for the word \"a\", the letter 'i\" is written with a capital sign and stands for the word I and the letter \"o\" never stands alone. We hope you enjoy learning more about the Braille alphabet.  \n\nThe Braille Alphabet Lyrics\nLet's learn the letters of the alphabet\nThey'll help you learn to read\nYou can read with your fingers very well\nStart with ABC\nConcentrate and do your best\nCome on and sing along\nFollow me, have fun and feel the beat\nSing the Braille Alphabet Song\nA a  /a/ a            1\nB b /b/  but       1, 2\nC c /c/ can        1,4\nD d /d/ do         1,4,5\nE e /e/ every          1,5\nF f /f/   from         1,2,4\nG g /g/  go       1,2,4,5\nH h  /h/ have          1,2,5\nI i  /i/  i                     2,4\nJ j /j/   just               2,4,5\nK k /k/ knowledge           1,3\nL l /l/   like            1,2,3\nLet's learn the letters of the alphabet\nThey'll help you learn to read\nYou can read with your fingers very well\nStart with ABC\nConcentrate and do your best\nCome on and sing along\nFollow me, have fun and feel the beat\nSing the Braille Alphabet Song\nM m /m/  more      1,3,4\nN n /n/     not        1,3,4,5\nO o /o/    O                1,3,5\nP p /p/   people           1,2,3,4\nQ q /q/   quite              1,2,3,4,5\nR r /r/      rather            1,2,3,5\nS s /s/    so                    2,3,4\nT t /t/     that                  2,3,4,5  \nU u /u/  us                      1,3,6\nV v /v/   very                   1,2,3,6\nW w /w/  will                   2,4,5,6\nX x /x/  it                          1,3,4,6\nY y /y/ you                     1,3,4,5,6\nZ z  /z/ as                       1,3,5,6\nLet's learn the letters of the alphabet\nThey'll help you learn to read\nYou can read with your fingers very well\nStart with ABC\nConcentrate and do your best\nCome on and sing along\nFollow me, have fun and feel the beat\nSing the Braille Alphabet Song\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "The Braille Alphabet With Alphabetic Word Signs by Jack Hartmann and Jessica Hayes MS ED was developed to assist students with visual impairments, and their families, learn the Braille Alphabet and their corresponding word signs. Each letter of the alphabet has a corresponding word sign. The letters of the alphabet when they are standing alone have a corresponding word sign. For example In Braille when you read the letter k, it can make the /k/ sound when part of a word. It represents the word knowledge when it is standing alone with a space on either side. In this song, we are representing the Alphabetic Braille Word Signs. Most of the letters of the alphabet have a corresponding alphabetic word sign. The letter 'a' stand for the word \"a\", the letter 'i\" is written with a capital sign and stands for the word I and the letter \"o\" never stands alone. We hope you enjoy learning more about the Braille alphabet.  This version is a higher contrast version of colors to make the braille dots stand out with higher contrast.\n\nThe Braille Alphabet Lyrics\nLet's learn the letters of the alphabet\nThey'll help you learn to read\nYou can read with your fingers very well\nStart with ABC\nConcentrate and do your best\nCome on and sing along\nFollow me, have fun and feel the beat\nSing the Braille Alphabet Song\nA a  /a/ a            1\nB b /b/  but       1, 2\nC c /c/ can        1,4\nD d /d/ do         1,4,5\nE e /e/ every          1,5\nF f /f/   from         1,2,4\nG g /g/  go       1,2,4,5\nH h  /h/ have          1,2,5\nI i  /i/  i                     2,4\nJ j /j/   just               2,4,5\nK k /k/ knowledge           1,3\nL l /l/   like            1,2,3\nLet's learn the letters of the alphabet\nThey'll help you learn to read\nYou can read with your fingers very well\nStart with ABC\nConcentrate and do your best\nCome on and sing along\nFollow me, have fun and feel the beat\nSing the Braille Alphabet Song\nM m /m/  more      1,3,4\nN n /n/     not        1,3,4,5\nO o /o/    O                1,3,5\nP p /p/   people           1,2,3,4\nQ q /q/   quite              1,2,3,4,5\nR r /r/      rather            1,2,3,5\nS s /s/    so                    2,3,4\nT t /t/     that                  2,3,4,5  \nU u /u/  us                      1,3,6\nV v /v/   very                   1,2,3,6\nW w /w/  will                   2,4,5,6\nX x /x/  it                          1,3,4,6\nY y /y/ you                     1,3,4,5,6\nZ z  /z/ as                       1,3,5,6\nLet's learn the letters of the alphabet\nThey'll help you learn to read\nYou can read with your fingers very well\nStart with ABC\nConcentrate and do your best\nCome on and sing along\nFollow me, have fun and feel the beat\nSing the Braille Alphabet Song\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Braille Numbers Song by Jack Hartmann is about recognizing the numbers 1 -0 in Braille.  \n This song came about from a very special request from a group of visually impaired students. \nFor the Braille Numbers In United English Braille (UEB), the first 10 letters of the alphabet make up the dots for the numbers 0-9.  A Braille reader places a special symbol, the number sign (dot 3,4,5,6) before the first 10 letters to make them turn into numbers. A number sign, dot 1, is the number one.\nIn this song you are introduced to the braille numbers 0-9. Number  0 is introduced last as it is the same dots as letter \"j\".\n\nBraille Numbers Song Lyrics\nTo learn the numbers in braille, we use the first 10 letters of the alphabet\nA-J\nTo learn the numbers in braille, we always start with the number sign\nDot 3,4,5,6\nCome on and sing along\nEverybody have fun\nAnd do the Braille Number Song\nNumber sign dot 1 \nIs number 1\nNumber sign dot 1,2\nIs number 2\nNumber sign dot 1,4\nIs number 3\nNumber sign dot 1,4,5\nIs number 4\nNumber sign dot 1,5\nIs number 5\nNumber sign dot 1,2,4\nIs number 6\nNumber sign dot 1,2,4,5\nIs number 7\nNumber sign dot 1,2,5\nIs number 8\nNumber sign dot 2,4\nIs number 9\nNumber sign dot 2,4,5\nIs number 0\nTo learn the numbers in braille, we use the first 10 letters of the alphabet\nA-J\nTo learn the numbers in braille, we always start with the number sign\nDot 3,4,5,6\nCome on and sing along\nEverybody have fun\nAnd do the Braille Number Song\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "The Nemeth Braille Numbers by Jack Hartmann demonstrate the Nemeth Braille Numbers. Braille readers have a separate Braille code to learn for Math and Science. One of those codes is the Nemeth Code. Students use symbols in the Nemeth Code to complete mathematical operations and scientific formulas. The beginning Braille reader needs to learn the Nemeth Code numbers to complete assignments in their math class. While creating the Nemeth Code numbers, the user will continue to use the number sign before the number but will not use dots 1 and 2, only the bottom four dots of the Braille Cell. The shapes of the numbers are the same, but in the lower part of the braille cell. The number 1 in Nemeth Code is number sign, dot 2. In this song you are reminded to use the number sign that was previously learned, as well as a reminder to orientate to the bottom part of the Braille Cell. \n\n\nBraille Nemeth Numbers Song\nLet's Learn the Nemeth Braille Numbers 0 to 9\nUse the 4 dots down and not the 2 up high\nWe still always use the number sign\nLearn the Nemeth Braille Numbers 0 to 9\nNumber sign dot 2 is number 1\nNumber sign dot 2,3 is number 2\nNumber sign dot 2,5 is number 3\nNumber sign dot 2,5,6 is number 4\nNumber sign dot 2,6 is number 5\nNumber sign dot 2,3,5 is number 6\nNumber sign dot 2,3,5,6 is number 7\nNumber sign dot 2,3,6 is number 8\nNumber sign dot 3,5 is number 9\nNumber sign dot 3,5,6 is number 0\nLet's Learn the Nemeth Braille Numbers 0 to 9\nUse the 4 dots down and not the 2 up high\nWe still always use the number sign\nLearn the Nemeth Braille Numbers 0 to 9\nThe Nemeth Braille Numbers 0 to 9\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Vowel Sound Hound Dogs by Jack Hartmann teaches the short medial vowel sounds.  Learn the short vowel sounds, a, e , i , o, u with Jack and the hound dogs.  Vowel Sound Hound Dogs  is a twist on the regular vowel sound songs. In this song, children will hear and act out medial vowel sounds (the vowel sounds heard in the middle of words), which is a more complicated skill than beginning vowel sounds. Get ready to bark, howl and say your vowel sounds! Move along with the action words to build brain and body connections. Wag your tail for the short a sound. Beg for a bone for the short e sound. Dig in the dirt for the short i sound. Flop your ears for the short o sound. Give a jump for the short u sound as you build body and brain connections learning the middle vowel sounds. \n\n\nLYRICS:\n\nVowel Sound Hound Dogs Lyrics\n\nA - E - I - O - U - ah ooh\nA - E - I - O - U - ah ooh\n\nHere come the Vowel Sound, woof, woof, Hound Dogs - ah ooh\nThey love to learn every day\n\nHere come the Vowel Sound, woof, woof, Hound Dogs - ah ooh\nThey say their vowels this way\n\nThey say the short (a) sound as they wag their tails\n\nThey go \u0103 - \u0103 - \u0103 wag\nThey go \u0103 - \u0103 - \u0103 wag\n\nThey say the short (e) sound as they beg for a bone\n\nThey go \u0115 - \u0115 - \u0115 beg\nThey go \u0115 - \u0115 - \u0115 beg\n\nThey say the short i sound as they dig in the dirt\n\nThey go \u012d - \u012d - \u012d dig\nThey go \u012d - \u012d - \u012d dig\n\nThey say the short o sound as they flop their ears\n\nThey go \u014f - \u014f - \u014f flop\nThey go \u014f - \u014f - \u014f flop\n\nThey say the short u sound as they play and jump\n\nThey go \u016d - \u016d - \u016d jump\nThey go \u016d - \u016d - \u016d jump\n\nHere come the Vowel Sound, woof, woof, Hound Dogs - ah ooh\nThey love to learn every day\n\nHere come the Vowel Sound, woof, woof, Hound Dogs - ah ooh\nThey say their vowels this way\n\nA - E - I - O - U - ah ooh\nA - E - I - O - U - ah ooh\n\n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2021\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Dancing Star by Jack Hartmann is a movement oriented, brain breaks song. Get your students up and dancing to the fun moves as they listen carefully to follow directions. Each student can be a Dancing Star while doing a wide variety of dance and movements. \nBrain Breaks engage children  and are an important part of learning. They give students a chance to assimilate prior learning while oxygenating the brain. These classroom brain breaks enhance energy and relaxation. \nDancing Star can be compared to the hugely popular Cha Cha Slide. Children follow directions and move together.  You can use brain breaks to start your day, anytime children need a positive physical activity, after lunch or for indoor recess on days with bad weather. \n My brain breaks songs can be used in physical education classes too. Teachers love how the children have to stop and put their hands to their ears to listen carefully. This is a great song to teach children about following directions.\nJack Hartmann's Dancing Star is sure to become a favorite.\n\nDancing Star Words and Music by Jack Hartmann, copyright 2011 Jack Hartmann www.jackhartmann.com \n\nLYRICS:\n\nDancing Star\n \nWatch me, watch me I can raise the roof \nWatch me, watch me I can shake it loose   \nShake it down then jump it up so far\nI can shine like a dancing star \n \nLet\u2019s get loose and warm it up \nAll together, step to the front\n Jump to the back and clap \nRaise your arms up in the air \nBack and forth like you just don\u2019t care\nRight leg stomp to the left\nLeft leg stomp to the right \nOne arm up, shake your hips \nI can disco just like this\nNow stop and pose \nBe cool, slide to the right \nBe cool, slide to the left\nJump up and count 4\n1,2,3,4\nRobo dance, move it, lock it \nLike a robot \nYou got it !\n \nWatch me, watch me I can raise the roof \nWatch me, watch me I can shake it loose   \nShake it down then jump it up so far\nI can shine like a dancing star \n \nNow everybody square it up \nStep to the back\n Slide to the right \nStep to the front\nSlide to the left \nNow cabbage patch, arms circle around\nBe cool, get down\nCountry dance, stomp and clap \nNow turn around\nClap like this \nClap, clap, clap, clap, clap\nTurn around again\nClap like this \nClap, clap, clap, clap\nRight leg stomp to the left\nLeft leg stomp to the right \nNow jump up, crisscross, crisscross \nShake your shoulders, shake your hips \nShake it like a salt shaker, like this\nNow turn around\nClap like this \nClap, clap, clap, clap, clap\nTurn around again\nClap like this\nClap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap\nDo your own dance\nDance free\nNow freeze\nLet\u2019s cool it down, do the sprinkler \nTake it down\nThat was fun\nWe\u2019re done \n\nHelp support us on Patreon!\nhttps://www.patreon.com/jackhartmann\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2022\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

The second time through the 10 division tables are mixed up and Jack gives time for you to answer first, which reinforces the correct answer and the third time through Jack leaves the answer blank for you to answer on your own with the division facts by 10 in random order.

      "description": "Humpty Dumpty by Jack Hartmann is an interactive version of an old favorite nursery rhyme.\nHumpty Dumpty nursery rhyme, finger play has been one of our most popular nursery rhymes for young children all over the world. Now, here is the song and a video so your children can follow Jack's movements and sing along.\n\nThis cool pop music version of Humpty Dumpty engages children with a great beat that will make them want to move their bodies and sing along. Your children will be actively engaged and develop those important brain and body connections so important for their healthy development. Jack's movements are simple and easy to follow for all children. They will hear and sing along with all the rhyming, which is so important for their language development. \n\nLiteracy studies have shown that children who are exposed to lots of rhyming activities are more likely to become better readers. So, lots of rhyming books and songs are wonderful for developing a good ear for language and awareness of words that rhyme.\n\nTeachers and parents can use this nursery rhyme as part of a nursery rhyme unit, a rhyming awareness and language development program, or even as a fun nursery rhyme brain break.\n\nLyrics\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall\nAll the King's horses\nAll the King's men\nCouldn't put Humpty together again\nNo, no, no, no\n\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall\nAll the King's horses\nAll the King's men\nCouldn't put Humpty together again\nNo, no, no, no\n\nThey tried to push him up\nHooph!\nThey tried to pull him up\nHuu, huu, huu\nThey tried to patch him up\nTch, tch, tch\nCouldn't put him back together again\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\nHumpty Dumpty had a great fall\nAll the King's horses\nAll the King's men\nCouldn't put Humpty together again\nNo, no, no, \nHumpty Dumpty\n\n\nHumpty Dumpty Lyrics\nHumpty Dumpty sat on a wall\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2023\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "The Moon by Jack Hartmann is a fantasy song about a child's fantasy of what it could be like on the moon. This song was inspired by my nephew who was fascinated by the moon as a child. The word moon was one of his first words. May the moon continue to shine its light on you.\n\nThe Moon Lyrics\n\nSo far, far away, up in the sky\nA beautiful ball shines on me\nIf I had my wish and were up on the moon\nI wonder, what wonders what I\u2019d see\n\nWould what I see, what would I do\nAnd what would I feel inside\nOh, if I could just be up there on The Moon\nSo bright and so high in the sky\nOh I\u2019d look all around, the castles and clouds\nAnd marshmallow hills by the sea\nWhere the man in the moon\nWould be singing a tune\nAnd smiling a smile just for me\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d see if it happened to me\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d see on The Moon\n\nThe Moon, the Moon, shining for all to see     \nThe Moon, The Moon, shining its light on me\n\nAfter a while, I thought I would try\nSearch through the mountains and caves\nWhere the moon dust would fly\nAnd clouds would drift by\nAnd bright-colored dragons and little kids playing\nAnd so I stayed there until I would dare\nTo reach for a star in the sky\nAnd when I jumped off the ground\nI suddenly found, there on the moon you really can fly\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d do if it all would be true\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d do on The Moon\n\nThe Moon, the Moon, shining for all to see     \nThe Moon, The Moon, shining its light on me\n\nJust as the night was starting to fall\nI thought about how happy I am\nTo run and to play, so far, far away\nSo far, far away from my home\nI remember the smiles, of Mother and Dad\nOf Grandma and Grandpa, too\nAnd I really could see, where I wanted to be\n I really could see how much they loved me\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d feel if it all could be real\nThat\u2019s what I\u2019d feel on The Moon\n\nThe Moon, the Moon, shining for all to see     \nThe Moon, The Moon, shining its light on me\nThe Moon, the Moon, shining for all to see     \nThe Moon, The Moon, shining its light on me\nShining its light on me\nShining its light on me\nShining its light on me\n\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2023\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

In this Three Billy Goats Gruff, the goats and the Troll learn to live together in harmony and help each other find food. This is a new story of co-operation and working together. \n\nBilly Goats Gruff Lyrics\n\nOnce upon a time, there were three Billy goats\nLiving in a valley so low\nThere was no grass to eat, no flowers or trees\nSo they said, hey, we\u2019ve got to go\nTo find a meadow, to get some food\nThey were so hungry, but they were cool\nWalking all together went the three billy goats\nBop, bop, boppin\u2019 up the hill \nThey were swinging their tails, right up the trail \nThen they stopped, and said, we\u2019ve got to chill   \nThere was a bridge, over a river \nUnder the bridge, there lived a Troll that made them shiver\nSo the first and smallest billy goat went over the bridge\nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap\n What?\nTrip-trap  \nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap,\nWhat? \nTrip-trap\nAnd the troll said:\nWho\u2019s that trip \u2013 trappin\u2019 over the bridge \nI\u2019m gonna gobble you up \nNo, you don\u2019t want me, I\u2019m small as can be \nI\u2019m the first Billy Goat Gruff\nWait for my brother, he\u2019s like no other \nHe\u2019s bigger and better than me \nAlright then, I\u2019ll wait for your brother\nThat sounds pretty sweet \nSo the second and bigger billy goat went over the bridge\nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap\n What?\nTrip-trap  \nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap,\nWhat? \nTrip-trap\nWho\u2019s that trip \u2013 trapping over the bridge\nI\u2019m gonna gobble you up\nNo, you don\u2019t want me I\u2019m small as can be \nI\u2019m the second Billy Goat Gruff \nWait for my brother, he\u2019s like no other \nHe\u2019s bigger and better than me \nAlright then I\u2019ll wait for your brother\nThat sounds pretty sweet \nSo the third and biggest billy goat went over the bridge\nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap\n What?\nTrip-trap  \nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap,\nWhat? \nTrip-trap\nWho\u2019s that trip \u2013 trappin\u2019 over the bridge,\nI\u2019m gonna gobble you up\nNo, you don\u2019t want me I\u2019m tough as can be \nI\u2019m the biggest Billy Goat Gruff \nI\u2019m really strong, with big horns \nBut hey, we don\u2019t have to fight \nI\u2019ll help you, you help me, let\u2019s live together in harmony\nAnd they shook hands and gave two thumbs up \nAnd that\u2019s the story of the Billy Goats Gruff \nAnd they all kept going\n Trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap\n What?\nTrip-trap  \nHe went trip-trap, trip-trap, trip-trap,\nWhat? \nTrip-trap\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2023\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

Children can even move and dance to the cool beat and music as they sing the stages in the frog's life cycle; Frog, Egg, Tadpole, Tadpole with legs, and Froglet.\nMetamorphosis is a big word and a challenging concept for children to learn, so we really made this frog's life cycle song simple and fun to do and sing.\nThe Frog\u2019s Life Cycle can be used in the science curriculum for children to learn about life cycles and animal habitats.  Strengthen your science program with some singing and movement fun.\nWe even try to help children learn how to spell metamorphosis at the end of our frog life cycle song.\n\nA Frog's Life Cycle Lyrics by Jack Hartmann\n\nHop, hop, hippity hop\nThat's what frogs do a lot\nHop, hop, hippity hop\nThat's the way they go, so\nAnd this is how they grow\nIt's all about survival\nIt's called the frog's life cycle\nFrog\nEgg\nTadpole\nTadpole with legs, swish, swish\nFroglet\nThen a frog\nIt's called metamorphosis\nFrog\nEgg\nTadpole\nTadpole with legs, swish, swish\nFroglet\nThen a frog\nIt's called metamorphosis\nHop, hop, hippity hop\nThat's what frogs do a lot\nHop, hop, hippity hop\nThat's the way they go, so\nAnd this is how they grow\nIt's all about survival\nIt's called the frog's life cycle\nFrog\nEgg\nTadpole\nTadpole with legs, swish, swish\nFroglet\nThen a frog\nIt's called metamorphosis\nm\ne\nt\na\nm\no\nr\np\nh\no\ns\ni\ns\nMetamorphosis\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2024\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Beautiful Butterfly\u00a9 by Jack Hartmann illustrates the life cycle of a butterfly. The four stages in the life cycle of a butterfly (metamorphosis) are beautifully and clearly shown in this real-life music video. Jack and Lisa Hartmann wrote this song, Beautiful Butterfly, to help children in Lisa\u2019s kindergarten class learn the four stages of the life cycle of a butterfly.  The vivid and colorful video includes all the real images of butterflies, their eggs, caterpillars (larvae and the chrysalis) and pupa.  The children will get to sing along with Jack and Lisa\u2019s beautiful song as they clearly see all  four stages of the life cycle of a butterfly.   No drawings, clip art, or cartoons are shown in the video.  All the images of the butterfly\u2019s life cycle are real.  Your children will learn so much about the life cycle of a butterfly as they sing about the four stages and see this amazing video.\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful Butterfly\u00a9\nWords and Music by Jack  and Lisa Hartmann, Copyright 2005 Jack Hartmann\nwww.jackhartmann.com\n\nI am a tiny egg on a leaf, I\u2019m very small and so hard to see\nBut I am growing and changing each day\nSoon I\u2019ll be hatching to my next stage\nNow I\u2019m a caterpillar chewing so much\nI chew my shell and leaves I just munch\nThe bigger I grow my skin sheds away\nThen on a branch, I make the shape of a \u201cJ\u201d\nI\u2019m growing it\u2019s true, I\u2019ll be a butterfly soon\n\nI\u2019ll fly, I\u2019ll fly \nFlutter my wings all around in the sky        \nI\u2019ll fly, I\u2019ll fly\nOne day I\u2019ll be a beautiful butterfly\n\nNow I\u2019m snug in a safe place\nA hard chrysalis protects me each day\nInside I sleep, change and grow\nAnd dream of all the places I\u2019ll go\nNow I\u2019m a butterfly with beautiful wings\nI stretch them out so they\u2019ll dry for me\nI move and pump my wings up and down\nGetting ready to fly all around\nI\u2019m happy to be a butterfly flying free\n\nI\u2019ll fly, I\u2019ll fly \nFlutter my wings all around in the sky        \nI\u2019ll fly, I\u2019ll fly\nOne day I\u2019ll be a beautiful butterfly\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2024\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Metamorphosis\u00a9 by Jack Hartmann is a song about the frog\u2019s life cycle. Metamorphosis makes learning about the life cycle of a frog and metamorphosis really simple and fun.  Children can even move and dance to the cool beat and music as they sing the stages in the frog's life cycle; Frog, Egg, Tadpole, Tadpole with legs, and Froglet.\nMetamorphosis is a big word and a challenging concept for children to learn so we really made this frog's life cycle song simple and fun to do and sing.\nThe Frog\u2019s Life Cycle can be used in the science curriculum for children to learn about life cycles and animal habitats.  Strengthen your science program and have some singing and movement fun.\nWe even try to help children learn how to spell.  Metamorphosis at the end of our frog life cycle song.\n\n\nMetmorphosis Lyrics and Music by Jack Hartmann\u00a9\nI'm a frog\nI'm a frog\nI have 4 legs and live in a pond\nSwim in the water and stop to spawn\nLay my eggs there in the pond\nI change and grow like this, it's called metamorposis\nI'm an egg\nI'm an egg\nI don't have gills and don't have legs\nStay in the water, grow and grow\nSoon I'll hatch and be a tadpole\nI change and grow like this, it's called metamorposis\nI'm a tadpole\nI'm a tadpole\nGills and mouth and teeth I grow\nWiggle my tail with my tadpole friends\nSoon we'll be tadpoles with legs\nI change and grow like this, it's called metamorposis\nI'm a tadpole with legs a tadpole with legs\nOnly 2 to move and bend\nI swim and grow and do my best\nI'll get 4 legs and be a froglet\nI change and grow like this, it's called metamorposis\nI'm a froglet\nI'm a froglet\nMy tail is shorter but not gone yet\nMy legs are growing and getting strong\nI'm ready to hop and be a frog\nI change and grow like this, it's called metamorposis\nI'm a frog\nI'm a frog\nI have 4 legs and swim in the pond\nI hop and croak and lay new eggs\nMy frog life cycle starts over again\nRibbit\nI'm a frog\nRibbit, ribbit\nI'm a frog\nI'm a frog\nRibbit, ribbit\nI'm a frog\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2024\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "The Dancing 2\u2019s \u00a9by Jack Hartmann helps students to learn to count to 100 as they skip count by 2\u2019s. To make this a brain-based math activity, have the students hold up two fingers on each hand. As they count by 2\u2019s they should sweep their right hand over to the left side of their body and then back again, doing the same from left to right. Crossing the mid-line (middle) of their body helps to encourage strong development of left brain/right brain communication. Another benefit is strengthening muscle coordination, which can support the development of fine motor skills such as writing numbers and drawing shapes.\nCount to 100 by 2's. \n\nDancing 2's\u00a9 Lyrics\n\nLet me introduce you to the Dancing 2\u2019s\nThey make you dance right to the groove.\nIt\u2019s really cool \u2013 just do like I do           \nAnd sing and move with the Dancing 2\u2019s\nBe cool cats \nCount by 2\u2019s\nBoogie\n2\n 4\n 6\n 8\n10\nNow Disco\n12\n14\n 16\n 18\n 20\nDo the Twist\n22 \n24,\n26,\n28,\n30\nDo the Floss Dance\n32\n 34,\n36\n 38\n 40\nChicken Dance\n42\n 44\n 46\n 48,\n50\nDo the Cool Dance\n52,\n54\n 56\n 58\n 60\nLet's Swim\n62\n 64\n66\n68\n70\nNow Wiggle Wobble\n72\n74\n 76\n 78\n 80\nDo the slide\n82\n 84\n86\n 88\n 90\nLet\u2019s jump it\n92\n 94\n 96\n98\n100\nLet me introduce you to the Dancing 2\u2019s\nThey make you dance right to the groove.\nIt\u2019s really cool \u2013 just do like I do           \nAnd sing and move with the Dancing 2\u2019s\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2024\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "There are 44 Phonemes\u00a9 by Jack Hartmann demonstrates the 44 phonemes in the English language.  There are just 26 letters in the English language and there are approximately 44 unique sounds.  These sounds are known as phonemes. The 44 sounds (phonemes)  help distinguish one word or meaning from another. Various letters and letter combinations known as graphemes are used to represent the sounds. \n The 44 English sounds fall into the two categories of consonants and vowels. Below is a list of the 44 phonemes, their International Phonetic Alphabet symbols, and some examples of their use. There is no definitive list of phonemes because of accents, dialects, and the evolution of language itself.  You may discover lists that are a variation of these 44 sounds.    \nJack Hartmann teaches the 44 phonemes in a fun and engaging way. Perfect for educators and parents looking to help children learn about phonics!\n\n44 Phonemes Lyrics\n\nPhonemes are the smallest unit of sound that make up words\nThere are 44 Phonemes\nTo help you write and read       \n44 Phonemes for you and me\nHear them, say them, and learn them now\n44 Phonemes, I\u2019ll show you how\n\nLet\u2019s start with the consonant phonemes\n   \n1.     /b/ as in ball\n2.    /d/as in dog\n3.    /f/ as in fish\n4.    /g/ as in goat\n5.    /h/ as in hand\n6.    /j/ as in jet\n7.    /k/ as in car\n8.    /l/ as in leaf\n9.    /m/ as in mouse\n10.  /n/ as in nose\n11.  /ng/ as sing /\u014b/ \n12.  /p/ as in pig\n13.  /r/ as in run\n14.  /s/ as in sun\n15. /zh/ as in treasure /\u0292/\n  \n16. /t/ as in tiger\n17. /v/ as in van\n18. /w/ as in watch\n19. /y/ as yo-yo\n20. /z/ as in zip\n21.  /ch/ as in child  /t\u0283/\n22.  /sh/ as in shoes /\u0283/\n23.  /th/ as in mother /\u03b8/\n24.  /th/ as in third /\u00f0/\n\nThere are 44 Phonemes\nTo help you write and read       \n44 Phonemes for you and me\nHear them, say them, and learn them now\n44 Phonemes, I\u2019ll show you how\n\nThese are the vowel phonemes\n\n25.  /a/ as in apple /\u00e6 /\n26.  /e/ as in egg  /\u025b /\n27.  /i/ as in igloo   /\u026a/\n28.  /o/ as in octopus   /\u0254/\n29.  /u/ as in umbrella /\u028c /\n30.  /ae/ as in rain /a\u026a /\n31.  /aw/ as in paw  /\u0254/\n32.  /ee/ as in tree /i /\n33.  /ie/ as in in light  /a\u026a/\n34.  /oa/ as in boat  /o\u028a/\n35.  /ue/ as in statue  / u:/\n36.  /oo/ as in food  /u /\n37.  /oo/ as in book /\u028a /\n38.  /ou/ as in cow /a\u028a /\n39.  /oi/ as in boy /\u0254\u026a /\n\nThese are the r controlled vowels\n40.  /ar/ as in jar\n41.  /er/ as in bird /\u025c\u02d0/\n42.  /air/ as in chair /e\u0259/\n43.  /ear/ as in clear /\u026a\u0259/\n44.  /or/ as in fork\n\nThere are 44 Phonemes to help you write and read\n44 Phonemes for you and me\n\n44 Phonemes!\n\n\nJack Hartmann's website: https://jackhartmann.com\n\nSubscribe to our YouTube Channel: https://goo.gl/ogaW1i\n\nRemember to connect with Jack Hartmann on his Social Networks:\n\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/hop2itmusic\nPinterest: https://pinterest.com/jackhartmann\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/Jack_Hartmann\n\nYou can find Jack Hartmann's Music on:\n\nJack Hartmann Website: https://jackhartmann.com\niTunes: https://goo.gl/GeDJeJ\nAmazon: https://goo.gl/Ei8C6B\nGoogle Play: https://goo.gl/doZpfS\nCD Baby: https://cdbaby.com/Artist/JackHartmann\n\nWords and Music by Jack Hartmann \nCopyright 2024\nJack Hartmann's  Hop 2 It Music",

      "description": "Go For It by Jack Hartmann. This song was inspired by our friend and fellow educator, Mr. Greg, from Kindergarten Smorgasboard.  I was listening to an interview with Mr. Greg and he expressed  that \"going for it\" is something we can all learn from our students.  Mr Greg's statement evolved to this song, \"Go for it.\" I hope this song serves to help you find your wings to Go For It!\n Get motivated with \"Go For It\" by Jack Hartmann! This uplifting song will inspire you to reach for your goals and never give up. Let's go for it together!\n\n\nGo For It Lyrics\nGo, go, go for it\nKeep trying and do your best\nGo, go, go for it\nYou're strong, think yes I can!\nYou can dream any dream\nDo anything \nIt's all up to you\nGo, go, go for it\nYou go!

Jack shows the sign for each letter and the letter sounds for each letter as he sings the letter name and the letter is shown on the screen.
