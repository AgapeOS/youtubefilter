Different coats, different behaviors, etc. We love them all!\nHere are 15 of the cutest and smartest animals on the planet. We might be a little biased.

These include being able to hold their breath for a long time, having a blowhole on top of their heads so they can quickly grab a breath of fresh air when they surface, special flippers that help them swim quickly through the water - they can even do something called ECHOLOCATION that allows them to find their way around and hunt for prey even in dark murky waters. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:41 Dolphins are Mammals\n1:10 Different Kinds of dolphins\n1:25 How big are they?\n1:44 How fast are they?\n1:57 Porpoising (leaping)\n2:15 Deep diving\n2:27 Using their tail & flippers\n2:35 Breathing with a blowhole\n3:15 Holding their breath\n3:24 Sleeping\n3:55 Interesting bodies\n5:37 Hunting for food\n6:17 Live in pods\n6:38 Dolphin babies (calf)\n7:40 Communication\n8:04 Echolocation\n8:33 Helping people\n\nWant to play \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 games about these animals?\nWe have \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68 that tie in with this video available here:\n\ud83c\udfa8 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/hszhq\n\ud83e\udde9 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/oqjrnq\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83d\udc33 Ocean Animals https://youtu.be/JOJkvhSpBiQ\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\ud83d\udc19 Octopus https://youtu.be/fHRS3bD4yPM\n\nFind more free courses and bonus goodies on our Foundation website here:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\nThis channel is made possible by The Socratica Foundation.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

They must be the hardest working insects in the world! They do a lot of the hard work needed to pollinate flowers and help plants grow. They also make honey, which is delicious, and beeswax, which they use to make their honeycomb (and we use in candles). \n\nLike all insects, bees have 3 main body parts as all insects: head, thorax, and abdomen. But bees have some additional special structures you'll learn about in this video including a HONEY STOMACH, POLLEN BASKETS, and a STINGER!\n\nWe'll also find out more about how pollination works, how honey is made from nectar, and how bees live their complicated, highly social life back at the beehive.

There are more than 350,000 different species of beetles\u2014that we know of so far! They are amazingly specialized for where they live and what they eat. You can tell this because it's their jaw and mouthparts that are so radically different between different species of beetles. \n\nBut you know what they all have in common? Beetles are all insects! That means they share some features with all insects: they have 3 main body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen), they have compound eyes and antennae for sensing things, they have 2 sets of wings, and 6 jointed legs. And instead of a skeleton made of bones inside their body, they have an exoskeleton. \n\nIn this video, we'll meet 10 beetles that are all special in their own way.

If you need help remembering that, just think: Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs were reptiles! The dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million years ago, but we still live with their descendants. Modern reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtle, crocodiles, alligators, geckos, komodo dragons, tortoises...can you think of any others?\n\nIn this video, you'll see many different reptiles and you'll learn about what they have in common and what distinguishes them from one another. For instance, reptiles are all \"cold-blooded\" (the scientific term is ectothermic), which actually means their body temperature is influenced by their surroundings.

This is the reality for many creatures on Earth. That's right, we're talking about nocturnal animals! These are the critters that sleep during the day and come alive at night. From the silent flight of owls to the sneakiest of sneaky foxes, we're taking a peek at the mysterious lives of these nighttime wanderers. It\u2019s time to turn on your flashlight and shed some light on these nighttime creatures. \nWhen the sun sets and we're winding down for the night, nocturnal animals are just getting started. Animals who are active during the night are called NOCTURNAL animals. On the other hand, animals who are active during the day, like humans, are called DIURNAL. But it doesn\u2019t end there\u2026there\u2019s actually a special term for animals who are active during the in-between times of dusk and dawn: CREPUSCULAR animals! That\u2019s a fun word to say. CRE-PUS-CU-LAR.  Crepuscular animals include cats, some owls, and even some species of bats. But today, we\u2019ll be focusing on animals who thrive during the dark hours of the night. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro/ what are nocturnal animals?\n1:20 Owls\n1:57 Rodents (mice, rats)\n2:33 Crickets\n3:13 Cockroaches\n3:54 Fox\n4:34 Bats\n5:20 Moths\n6:28 Group of similar animals: opossum, skunk, badger, porcupine, hedgehog, nine-banded armadillo\n7:11 Raccoon\n7:41 Nightingale\n8:22 Frogs\n9:04 Fireflies\n\nWant to play \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 games about these animals?\nWe have \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68 that tie in with this video available here:\n\ud83c\udfa8 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/mfoowq\n\ud83e\udde9 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/mctgp\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83d\udc1e10 Beetles https://youtu.be/YfFoVuU0mFc\n\ud83d\udc01 City Animals https://youtu.be/2b7H94vUnWw\n\ud83e\udd89 Owls https://youtu.be/9UzCR2wmmjg\n\n\nFind more free courses and bonus goodies on our Foundation website here:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\nThis channel is made possible by The Socratica Foundation.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nDo you know how volcanoes work?\nVolcanoes are NOT like other mountains, sitting all quiet and pretty. They have a lot going on inside! It gets so hot, rocks melt (we call this molten rock magma). Pressure builds up, and eventually they ERUPT! \n\nWhat comes out of a volcano? When the molten rock is on the outside, now we call it LAVA. But that's not all. There are also a variety of gases (like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) and ash (very fine particles of rocks, minerals, and glass). \n\nIn this video, you'll see many different volcanoes and learn about how they work.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nHurricanes are massive storms that form over warm ocean waters. Depending on where you live, you might call them typhoons, or cyclones. Did you know these were three different names for the same kind of giant storm?\n\nWhen we say giant storm, we mean GIANT storm\u2014hurricanes can be hundreds of miles across. And they look a lot like a spiral galaxy!  How else will you recognize hurricanes? They have an open spot in the middle called the EYE, and surrounding the eye is the EYE WALL.  See also the spiral rain bands.  And the hurricane twists in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. \n\nIn this video, you'll see examples of hurricanes and learn about how they work.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nWhen you say tsunami, do you know you're speaking Japanese? Tsunami is made up of two Japanese words: tsu (harbor) + nami (wave). So tsunami means \"harbor wave\" in Japanese. Why were they named this? Because these are the kind of giant waves that destroyed harbors. \n\nThese waves don't play nice on the beach for us to splash in. Tsunami waves stretch up way up tall like a giant wall made of water, rushing onto the shore and mowing down everything in their path. \n\nIn this video, we'll learn about the special ways tsunamis are different from ordinary waves. Where do they come from? How fast do they move? Where on Earth are they most common? What can we do to prepare for them? \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:52 What causes a tsunami?\n1:25 What does tsunami mean in Japanese?\n1:59 Speed\n2:33 Wavelength (distance between peaks)\n3:33 Tsunami waves\n4:17 Height\n4:51 Where do tsunamis happen?\n5:34 Warning signs\n6:25 Staying prepared\n7:14 Famous tsunamis\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

You'll look at our poster and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nWhirlpools are something we can experience in our own homes (on a small scale): you can watch water draining out of your sink or your bathtup or even the toilet! But whirlpools are also a natural phenomenon. They usually happen when two different currents, going in different directions, meet in a body of water. These can happen in the ocean, in a river, or even a lake. \n\nWe're used to stories and myths about GIANT whirlpools sucking down ships. But actually, in nature, whirlpools rarely pull in boats. If you know what to look for, you can avoid them! Also some whirlpools are pretty small. But some are very large, and are even tourist attractions! \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:34  What Are Whirlpools?\n1:17 How big are they?\n2:06 What causes whirlpools?\n3:12 How long do they last?\n4:14 How do you recognize them?\n4:37 Are whirlpools dangerous?\n5:15 Famous whirlpools\n5:56 Whirlpools in mythology\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0a Tsunami https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

All of these floods have one big thing in common: there's a lot of water where there usually isn't any. This can happen quickly or slowly, depending on the type of flood. \n\nIn this video, we'll learn about these different kinds of floods and what causes them. When a flood happens, it can bring about a lot of changes. Mostly bad, but would you believe there are some positive things that can come out of a flood, too? We'll talk about it.

OR...like a snowball rolling down a hill, getting bigger and bigger as it goes. Did you know there are different kinds of avalanches?\n\nIn this video, we talk about several different kinds of avalanches: slab avalanches, wet avalanches, and loose slow avalanches. We also learn about where avalanches are more likely to happen, and what causes them\u2014both in the short-term, but also what are some underlying circumstances that make avalanches take place. \n\nThere are steps you can take to avoid being caught in avalanches, but just in case it happens, we also talk about how to make it more likely you will survive and be found by search and rescue teams. Finally, we take a peek at some of the steps people are taking to prevent avalanches from happening in the first place.  \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:37 Definition * Types\n1:53 Causes\n3:13 Climate Change\n4:08 Safety Precautions\n5:09 What to Do in an Avalanche\n5:59 Search & Rescue\n6:47 Prevention\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

These are LANDSLIDES. \nDid you know there are different kinds of landslides? Slides, flows, falls, and topples. You'll learn how to tell them apart in this video! \n\nWhat causes landslides? Sometimes it's completely natural, but this is one of those acts of nature that people sometimes influence (especially by deforestation).

EARTHQUAKES happen when tectonic plates move against each other. You can picture tectonic plates like gigantic puzzle pieces that make up all of the Earth's crust. \nIn this video we'll talk about some of the causes of Earthquakes, and how scientists study them using special tools like seismographs. We'll learn how to describe the size of earthquakes using the Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale.

But somehow we escaped that fate. Today, let's learn about what quicksand actually is (not a type of sand!) and how to get out if you ever actually see some and fall in. \nIt's a lot harder to get out of tar pits, as evidenced by the many fossils found in them. Have you ever been to the La Brea Tar Pits or another tar pit? We'll take a look at how they are formed and why it was so hard for the prehistoric animals to escape them.

And you get both thunder and lightning in THUNDERSTORMS. \n\nToday we'll talk about how thunderstorms happen. First, we'll look at the special clouds involved: CUMULONIMBUS clouds. Next we'll think about what happens inside the clouds that leads to electricity building up and eventually discharging in the form of lightning. \nDid you know there are different kinds of lightning? We will talk about the several kinds that can happen during thunderstorms, including cloud to cloud lightning, and cloud to ground lightning. There are more.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nTornadoes aren't just found in movies like Twister (and Twisters) and the Wizard of Oz. They're a real natural phenomenon with enormous power. In this video we'll learn what causes tornadoes, and what situations make them more likely to occur. This has to do with geography (places like \"Tornado Alley\" are more likely to have tornadoes) but also just the right weather conditions.\n\nNot all tornadoes are the same, and we'll learn about supercell and non-supercell tornadoes. Then there's a variety of intensities\u2014meteorologists (weather scientists) use the Fujita scale so we all know just how big of a tornado we're talking about. \n\nDid you hear the term \"mesocyclone?\" You'll come across this term again in our video about thunderstorms.

They each have a distinct  climate, with plants and animals that are well-suited to live there. \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40 so you get to see each new video!\n\nWhere do you call home? That is, where would Mother Nature say you live? When we're talking about nature and ecology, it doesn't matter what city, state,  or country you live in. We're talking about BIOMES, which are like nature's neighborhoods. \nThere are 5 or 11 different biomes, depending on who you ask. The basic 5 are Aquatic, Desert, Forest, Grassland, and Tundra. These can be further split up into 11! Each of these biomes are home to distinct plants and animals (flora and fauna) that are well adapted for the specific sort of climate found in that biome. \nSo for instance, the desert is known for having very little rainfall, and most deserts get pretty hot. So the plants and animals that live there have evolved to have adaptations well-suited for that set of living conditions. The plants don't have big broad leaves that would wilt in the sun. Instead they have spikes or spines, like cacti. The animals tend to be small, and are more active at night, when it's cooler, and often have big ears to cool off. Compare that with animals that live in the cold, where they are more likely to be bigger but have little ears, and layers of blubber for insulation to stay warm. \n\nIn this series, we'll look at the 11 different biomes that ecologists study. We'll discuss the specific climate, plants, and animals found in each biome. We are planning a follow-up series that goes into greater depth about the animals in each biome.

But Tropical Grasslands is a phrase that ecologists use to describe a very specific biome. This is a place close to the equator, that stays comfortably warm all year long, and supports a wide variety of different plants and animals (flora and fauna). Including GRASS! \nIf you think about going on Safari to see animals like Lions, Giraffes, Wildebeest, etc. you'll have a good idea what Tropical Grasslands (also known as the savanna) is like.

The word \"Temperate\" lets you know that this is not a place of extremes, but rather sort of average! There are four seasons, but still it never gets TOO hot or TOO cold. That's partly because there is fairly consistent precipitation, and the water vapor in the air helps maintain the even temperature. Compare that with the desert, where the temps can swing wildly from burning hot to freezing cold in the same day. \nIn this video, we'll look at the characteristic plants of the Temperate Forest Biome - it should come as no surprise that trees are involved in a forest, but you may not know that it's especially the trees that change color in autumn that can be found here. We also meet some of the animals that call this biome home. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Temperate Forest\n0:52 What is a Biome?\n1:34 The Four Seasons\n3:51 Precipitation in the Temperate Forest\n4:43 Types of Temperate Forest\n6:19 What are the Plants like?\n8:01 What are the Animals like?\n\nHave you seen our video on the BOREAL FOREST Biome?\n\ud83c\udf32 https://youtu.be/eq9XvKeM0kc\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

But did you know you can also have a COLD desert, with ice sheets, lichen, and penguins? Antarctica is also considered a desert! It's because what makes a desert isn't the heat, but the lack of precipitation. So we have a variety of different deserts around the world\u2014some hot, some cold, but all of them are very dry. \nIn this video, we'll look at the desert biome and the plants and animals that call it home. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:53 Definition of Desert\n1:45 What\u2019s a Biome\n2:26 Climate - Hot or Cold\n4:41 Desert Plants\n6:08 Desert Animals\n7:53 Visit the Deserts\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

Polar Bears, reindeer, and the big guy himself, SANTA. But what about the South Pole? Who lives there? \nThe icy, frozen land at the south pole is a special biome known as the Antarctic Tundra, and it's home to some unusually adapted plants and animals that can survive the harsh conditions. It's the coldest place on Earth, and it's also one of the driest. That's right - it gets so little precipitation, it's technically a desert!\nIn this video, we'll learn more about the climate, the times of year when it's all sun or no sun, and the special plants and animals that live there.

A biome is not just a place, but also the climate, plants and animals that live there because they are well-suited for life in those conditions. In the case of the Tropical Forest biome, it's always warm, because in the tropics (areas close to the equator), the amount of sunshine throughout the year is fairly constant. There's also abundant rainfall. This means a lot of plant life, which means in turn a lot of animal life! There's a huge diversity of flora and fauna in the Tropical Forest Biome. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Tropical Forest\n0:52 Definition of this Biome\n2:27 At the Equator\n3:46 Weather & Climate\n5:18 Forest Layers\n6:57 Rainforest Plants\n8:18 Rainforest Animals\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

The whole center part of the United States is mostly this biome, and is nicknamed the \"Country's Breadbasket.\" It's not just home to a lot of our agriculture. As a biome, it serves as the natural habitat for a variety of plant and animal life including wild grasses (hence the name), wildflowers, bison, rabbits, mice, prairie dogs, etc. \nMuch of this kind of land has been developed for agricultural purposes, not just in the US but all around the world. In this video, we'll consider the changes that have been made, and if there's a way to get back to a more sustainable situation in this important biome. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro - Temperate Grassland = breadbasket\n1:14 Definition of Biome\n2:30 Where on Earth\n4:26 Climate\n5:55  Plants\n7:00 Animals\n8:40 Agriculture\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. \n\nIn this video, we take a closer look at the animals that are able to live in the specific conditions of the TROPICAL GRASSLAND, aka the Savanna Biome: fairly constant temperature, because this biome is found along the equator where there are similar hours of daylight all year long. But there is a distinct wet season and dry season. Animals who live here have to be specially adapted to handle both of these extremes. Could you do this? \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Savanna Biome conditions\n1:14 African Elephant\n2:31 Lion\n3:31 Giraffe\n4:48 Cheetah\n6:01 Zebra\n6:56 African Wild Dog\n8:11 Biomes Course\n8:37 Warthog\n9:48 Hyena\n11:00 Dung Beetle\n12:00 Ostrich\n13:28 Secretary Bird\n14:34 Meerkat\n\n\ud83e\udd81 Savanna/ Tropical Grassland Biome: https://youtu.be/IJhSgu32haA\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. \n\nIn this video, we take a closer look at the animals that are able to live in the conditions of the Desert Biome. Deserts are found all over the world, and what they have in common is very little rainfall. We also tend to think of deserts being hot places, but did you know there are cold deserts as well? If you'd like to learn more about that, check out our Desert Biome video next. \n\nIn this video, we're focusing on the adaptations the animal residents of the desert have, that make them well-suited for life there. How do they get by in such a dry place? Do they have strategies for conserving water? Sometimes these adaptations are physical, sometimes, behavioral. See if you can notice the difference for each animal we talk about! \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Desert Biome adaptations\n0:59 Fennec Fox\n2:03 Dromedary Camel\n3:11 Sidewinder Snake\n4:10 Gila Monster\n5:16 Roadrunner\n6:16 Desert Tortoise\n7:10 Biomes Series\n7:35 Kangaroo Rat\n8:35 Scorpion \n9:28 Coyote\n10:19 Meerkat \n11:06 Bearded Dragon\n\n\ud83c\udf35 Desert Biome: https://youtu.be/mvRxt4F0Qo4\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

At first glance, it doesn't look like there's much life here in this frozen place that doesn't get a lot of sunlight for much of the year. But look closer, and you'll see many different kinds of penguins and seals, both of which spend some of their time on land, and some in the frigid waters. Once in the water, you'll find giants like orcas and blue whales, along with teeny tiny animals like krill. How do these animals handle the cold? We'll look at some of the special adaptations, both physical and behavioral, that allow a few special animals to thrive in this biome. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to the Antarctic Tundra Biome\n1:05 Emperor Penguin\n3:08 Weddell Seal\n4:40 Antarctic Krill\n5:44 Leopard Seal\n7:22 Snow Petrel\n8:28 Antarctic Midge\n9:58 Orca (Killer Whale)\n11:25 Gentoo Penguin\n12:26 South Polar Skua\n13:39 Ad\u00e9lie Penguin\n14:28 Blue Whale\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43\n\ud83d\udc27 Antarctic Tundra Biome https://youtu.be/cIJa26i0cPc\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. Snakes are unusual in that they are adapted to do well in many different biomes. \n\nOf course, snakes are not all identical. Take a close look at the snakes in this video. They have special adaptations, both physical and behavioral, that make them well adapted to the environment they live in. \n\nIn this video, we'll learn more about what snakes are like. What do they eat? Can they sense the world (seeing, hearing, etc) like we do? How do they move around since they have no legs?  \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Some snakes have a secret (vestigial legs)\n0:46 Snake anatomy\n1:46 How do snakes move? \n3:31 What are snakes?

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. \n\nIn this video, we take a closer look at the animals that are able to live in the specific conditions of the TROPICAL FOREST biome. This is sometimes called the Rainforest, because of the extremely high amount of rainfall. All that humidity means the temperature is fairly stable. So you don't see animals that are especially adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Rather, we find a variety of animals that have special adaptations that allow them to thrive at different levels of this moist forest. Some animals live way up in the trees. Others live down on the forest floor. Can you imagine how these would require different physical and behavioral traits? \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Tropical Forest Biome\n1:19 Jaguar\n2:10 Poison Dart Frog\n3:09 Harpy Eagle\n4:05 Sloth\n5:09 Capybara\n6:11 Howler Monkey\n7:16 Green Anaconda\n8:49 Toco Toucan\n9:50 Okapi\n10:42 Leafcutter Ant\n11:52 Baird's Tapir\n\n\n\ud83e\udd9c Tropical Forest Biome https://youtu.be/OK5rdXFOsjQ\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

She lives in Scandiland, where kids don't go to school but instead do real work in apprenticeships until they find what profession suits them. Astrid starts her journey in this episode. \n\nAstrid's Journal is an illustrated audiobook series perfect for fans of Harriet the Spy, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Ender's Game. In combination with the Reader's Guide Exercises, it is a robust introduction for students (grades 3-8) to the powerful techniques of journaling. \n\nKeeping a journal is one of the most appealing tools for developing writing skills. Journaling is also beneficial for emotional development, helping kids better understand the events in their lives, recognizing their responses, and how to deal with them constructively. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Looking for a way to help your child develop a lifelong writing habit? \ud83d\udca1\nJournaling is a great way to encourage self-expression, build writing skills, and develop emotional intelligence. In this video, we introduce journaling in a kid-friendly way that makes it easy to get started! Whether your child is new to journaling or already loves writing, this introduction offers practical tips and creative ideas to help them find their voice. \nWatch our Introduction to Journal Writing for kids: \n\u270d\ufe0f https://youtu.be/_NvWo2lUwdU\n\n\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d \ud835\ude44\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4e\nThe focus of each episode of Astrid's Journal is to help students build strong foundational skills, meeting the Reading Standards for the Common Core for English Language Arts (Literature and Writing) for grades 3-5. Please see the attached PDF \"Reader's Guide\" that includes a variety of enrichment activities to extend the learning experience for the above mentioned areas, as well as writing exercises. Students will get experience reflecting on what they have read, as well as producing their own work through a series of journaling prompts for each episode. Note the interdisciplinary nature of the exercises, including history, geography, and math as well as language arts. \n\nFocus Domains:\nReading Foundational Skills\nReading Literature\nSpeaking and Listening\nWriting\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

Topics discussed in this video include the benefits of journaling for developing writing skills, as well as emotional intelligence. A few themes for journals are suggested, as well as the idea of more specific Journal Writing Prompts. Reading other journals is introduced, including those that are historical, as well as works of fiction. Two that we recommend are:\n\nThe Diary of a Young Girl, by Anne Frank\n \ud83d\udcd8 https://amzn.to/4iLZlyq\n\nHarriet the Spy, by Louise Fitzhugh\n  \ud83d\udcd8  https://amzn.to/3XAQoiR\n\nIncluded in this video is a preview of our new Illustrated Audiobook series, \"Astrid's Journal.\" Participating in this series is a truly interactive way to get kids reading, listening, and writing.

She lives in Scandiland, where kids don't go to school but instead do real work in apprenticeships until they find what profession suits them. Astrid starts her journey in this episode. \n\nAstrid's Journal is an illustrated audiobook series perfect for fans of Harriet the Spy, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Ender's Game. In combination with the Reader's Guide Exercises, it is a robust introduction for students (grades 3-8) to the powerful techniques of journaling. \n\nKeeping a journal is one of the most appealing tools for developing writing skills. Journaling is also beneficial for emotional development, helping kids better understand the events in their lives, recognizing their responses, and how to deal with them constructively. \n\n\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d \ud835\ude44\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4e\nThe focus of each episode of Astrid's Journal is to help students build strong foundational skills, meeting the Reading Standards for the Common Core for English Language Arts (Literature and Writing) for grades 3-5.
