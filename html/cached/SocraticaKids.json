Careful!  Identity elements are specific to each operation (addition, multiplication, etc.).  So while 1 is the identity element for multiplication, it is NOT the identity element for addition.\n\nAbout this series:\nEvery Thursday, we're going to Math Camp!  This year, we're learning about ARITHMETIC.  We'll learn how to add, subtract, multiply, and divide.  We'll also learn about whole numbers (integers), fractions, decimals, and complex numbers. These are topics that first come up in arithmetic, but will continue to be helpful in other math subjects like algebra, trigonometry, geometry, and more.

      "description": "How to Make Slime is one of the segments from our Brand New Puppet Science Show!  This segment is a SNEAK PEEK at our upcoming episode all about SLIME!! \n\nIn this segment, Charlie makes a beautiful, shiny PURPLE slime!  This slime is also called an OOBLECK. Making slime is a fun and easy science experiment for kids.\n\nYou can follow along at home! Here are the supplies you'll need for this science project:\n\n1/2 cup water\n1/2 cup glue\n1/2 cup liquid starch\nglitter and food colouring\n2 bowls\na spoon\n\nYou can find these supplies here:\n\nWhite glue\nhttp://amzn.to/2mthZTN\n\nLiquid starch\nhttp://amzn.to/2nnvHqa\n\nFood coloring\nhttp://amzn.to/2nnAgku\n\nGlitter\nhttp://amzn.to/2mUI0aN\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWhat do you know about Oobleck? Have you ever touched it? It has some VERY strange behavior.  Sometimes it acts like a liquid, and sometimes it acts like a solid! After you make your slime, notice how it behaves like a thick liquid if you squeeze it slowly, but it seems more like a solid if you slap it with your hand.\n\nPuppet Science is a great way for kids to get involved in science. They can play along with their puppet friends and learn a lot! Charlie's Lab lets kids do hands-on activities that are fun and safe, with step-by-step instructions. This is perfect if you are looking for experience following directions, and for sensory play. This is a great science activity for kids in preschool, kindergarten and grade school.  \n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe Recommend the fun and educational delivery boxes from Steven Spangler:\n\nSpangler Science Club - Interactive Science Activities delivered every month\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1241388&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\nFor Teachers: Really Good Box of Stuff - new themed educational box delivered each month (something for you and something for your class)\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1223138&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nBe sure to SUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss our next episode of the Super Fun Puppet Science Spectacular Show!\nhttp://bit.ly/1MJY7Cd\n\nWritten by Cassi Jerkins\nPerformed by Cassi Jerkins and Michael Rosenbaum\nProduced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison and Michael Harrison",

Learn about outer space with your puppet friends! \n\nDid you know we\u2019ve actually visited the moon?  The first two men who walked on the moon were named Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. That was back in 1969.  A total of 12 people have walked on the moon!  Would you like to go? \n\nYou have to wear a spacesuit when you\u2019re there, because there\u2019s no air. It also gets super hot during the day, and super hot at night.  Maybe NASA will let you borrow one of their spacesuits! \n\nFun Moon Phases Activity:  Kids can go outside at night (bring a grownup!) and draw how much of the moon they see.  In about 4 weeks, they\u2019ll have drawings for all the phases of the moon! \n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nLooking for more great Astronomy videos?\nWe have a series of educational videos for kids all about space!\nTry another Astronomy video:\n\nBlack Holes for Kids  http://bit.ly/BlackHoles4Kids\nThe Moon   http://bit.ly/Moon4Kids\nLunar Eclipse  http://bit.ly/LunarEclipseForKids\nSolar Eclipse  http://bit.ly/Astronomy_Kids\nIs This a Planet  http://bit.ly/Planet_Game\nMercury for Kids  http://bit.ly/Planet_Mercury\nStars & Constellations  http://bit.ly/StarsForKids\n\nBe sure to SUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss our next episode!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nDo your kids love science?

Here are 8 fantastic facts about octopuses! \n\nThis video is for Kids who LOVE animals!  \nHave you ever met an octopus? In this video, you\u2019ll learn about these amazing, intelligent animals. They have very unusual bodies. They\u2019re soft and squishy, because they have no skeleton! And they have 8 arms covered with powerful suckers.  The most amazing thing about octopuses is their big brains that allow them to learn, use tools, and solve puzzles.

The Moon comes between the Sun and the Earth, and casts a shadow on the Earth.  If you\u2019re standing in the Moon\u2019s shadow, you\u2019ll see the Moon completely block out the Sun. If you\u2019re outside the Moon\u2019s shadow, you\u2019ll see a partial eclipse. \n\nThe stages of a Total Solar Eclipse are\n1 - Partial Eclipse\n2 - Baily\u2019s Beads\n3 - Diamond Ring\n4 - Totality\n\nDuring Totality, you\u2019ll get to see the Sun\u2019s Corona.  That\u2019s the Sun\u2019s outer atmosphere. It\u2019s always there, but the Sun is so bright we can\u2019t see it. We only get the chance to see it during a Total Solar Eclipse. \n\n\u2605\u2605\u2605VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTE\u2605\u2605\u2605\nIf you have a chance to watch a Total Solar Eclipse, you MUST wear Eclipse Glasses or you will permanently damage your eyes. \nMany fake eclipse glasses have been sold on Amazon.com\nPlease read these articles and be safe!  \nhttps://eclipse.aas.org/eye-safety/iso-certification\nHere is an approved list of vendors:\nhttps://eclipse.aas.org/resources/solar-filters\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nDo your kids love science?

      "description": "Did you know that many dinosaurs were VEGETARIANS?  Another word for animals that only eat plants is HERBIVORE. We can tell which dinosaurs ate plants by looking at fossils of their teeth. Animals that eat plants have very different looking teeth than meat-eaters.  Many plant-eating dinosaurs also had bird-like heads, with a beak.  Here are 9 dinosaurs who loved to eat veggies!  \n\nIf your kids loved Jurassic Park and Jurassic World, here\u2019s a great video for them to learn about REAL dinosaurs! We feature 9 dinosaurs from the Jurassic Period and Cretaceous Period, compare their sizes, and show their unusual features. \n\nHere you can skip to each dinosaur: \n0:20   Triceratops - had 3 horns on its face\n1:20    Stegosaurus - had plates sticking up on its back\n2:25    Brontosaurus - had a long neck and a long tail\n3:29    Therizinosaurus - had the longest claws of any animal\n4:46    Ankylosaurus - had a tail like a club\n5:48    Parasaurolophus - had a crest like a pipe on its head\n6:50    Dracorex - looked like a fairy-tale dragon\n8:04    Iguanodon - one of the inspirations for Godzilla\n9:02    Stegoceras - had a very thick skull\n\nWhich Dinosaur did you like best? \nIs there another animal you\u2019d like to learn about? \nTell us in the comments.

      "description": "Time to do Halloween Science Experiments for Kids! Are you ready for some Spooky Science fun?  We're getting ready for Halloween and making Floating Ghosts! You can make some, too! \n\nIn this video, Charlie shows you how to make tissue paper ghosts that can fly when you wave a balloon over them!  How does it work?\n\nIt's because of STATIC ELECTRICITY.  If you rub a balloon on your hair, you build up negative charges (electrons) on the balloon.  The tissue paper has positive charges that are attracted to the negative charges on the balloon!  It's Spooky Science!  \n\nWe also do an experiment. Remember, an experiment is when you test a hypothesis.  Charlie makes a hypothesis that lighter materials like tissue paper will fly easier than heavier ones like regular paper.  Watch as we test this hypothesis!  You can do your own experiment at home by cutting out ghosts of different materials and seeing which ones work best.  Remember to make a hypothesis and then test it! \n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nMaterials used in this video:\n\nBalloons\nhttp://amzn.to/2nS84UE\n\nFiskars Kids Training Safety Scissors\nhttp://amzn.to/2wK5AMe\n\nTissue paper\nhttp://amzn.to/2g5HMiH\n\nHalloween Lights\nhttp://amzn.to/2kBnXBl\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe Recommend the fun and educational delivery boxes from Steven Spangler:\n\nSpangler Science Club - Interactive Science Activities delivered every month\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1241388&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\nFor Teachers: Really Good Box of Stuff - new themed educational box delivered each month (something for you and something for your class)\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1223138&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nDo your kids love science?

      "description": "Here\u2019s a fun treat you can make for Halloween - GLOWING JELLO!  Are you ready to have some Spooky Science Fun?  Let\u2019s make this weird glow in the dark jello together!\n\nOur puppet friend Charlie explains that this isn\u2019t actually \u201cglow-in-the-dark\u201d jello, because it doesn\u2019t glow on its own.  First, you shine a black light on it (UV or ultraviolet) - then the jello fluoresces out a different color light that we can see.  \n\nCAUTION:  DO NOT LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE BLACK LIGHT!\nUV LIGHT DAMAGES YOUR EYES. \n\nHere\u2019s what you need to make glowing jello at home:\n1 package of Jello (any brand will do) - green works better than orange or red\n1 cup boiling water\n1 cup tonic water\nA bowl\nA spoon\nA refrigerator\n\nDo you know which of these ingredients makes the jello glow?  It\u2019s the TONIC WATER.  Tonic water contains a special ingredient called Quinine. Quinine is fluorescent.  When you shine a black light at it, it absorbs the UV light and fluoresces out a blue light. \n\nWe made our glowing jello in a jar. What shape would you like to make? Tell us in the comments! \n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nDo your kids love science? Puppet science is a great way to keep kids excited about science and do safe and educational science activities!  Perfect for preschool, kindergarten, and elementary school. Do you homeschool?

You can DIY by following along! It's a great activity for kids Halloween parties!\n\nOur puppet friend Charlie explains how the spooky sound maker works. It\u2019s AMPLIFICATION!\n\nWhen you rub the string, it vibrates. That makes a sound, but the vibrations are too small for us to hear them. But when you tie the string to the cup, the cup AMPLIFIES the sound. Now the vibrations are big enough to hear them!\n\n(here\u2019s a little secret - you can also use this sound maker to make CHICKEN noises! Charlie shows you how at the end of the video)\n\nHere\u2019s what you need to make the spooky sound maker at home:\n1 plastic cup\n1 piece of string or yarn - a couple of feet long is good\nA paperclip\nA damp sponge or damp paper towel\nSomething pointy like a sharp pencil\n\nWhat would you like Charlie to make next?

      "description": "Do you know what kinds of animals live in Australia? They\u2019re pretty different from the animals in the rest of the world. Kangaroos, Koalas, Wallabies, Wombats, Quokkas, Tasmanian Devils...these are MARSUPIALS. That\u2019s a special kind of mammal that is born very small and underdeveloped. They crawl into their mother\u2019s pouch and finish growing to full size there! \nThen there are even odder mammals called monotremes. These mammals actually LAY EGGS.

Scully knows a lot about all the parts of the skull - there are 22 bones in the skull. 8 of them make up the Cranium, which protects your brain. The other 14 bones are Facial Bones. Do you know what is the one bone in your skull you can move? Scully knows! Watch and find out! \n\nFun activity idea - draw your own Dia de los Muertos skulls! \n\nAre you looking for more SMART + FUN videos for Halloween?\nWe have a playlist of Halloween videos for you to try:\nhttp://bit.ly/Halloween_Videos\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nDo your kids love science?

We\u2019ll learn all about these beautiful animals - what they eat, do they really sleep standing up...and how we measure them using a really weird unit: HANDS. \n\nWe'll also learn about all the different names we use to describe a horse family: A mother horse (dam), a father horse (sire), a baby horse (foal), whether it's a boy (colt) or a girl (filly). A grown-up female horse is a mare, while a grown-up male horse is a stallion.\n\nHow many different kinds of horses do you know? We have a PARADE of HORSES for you - see how many you can name! \n\nHere's a special challenge for you if you love COUNTING. How many horses are there in this video?

Did you know that Benjamin Franklin wanted the Turkey to be the National Bird of the United States? It really is an impressive bird - wild turkeys get up to around 30 pounds. That\u2019s probably why they are associated with family feasts in America. But how much do you know about the turkey?\nFor instance, did you know that turkeys can fly?  Wild Turkeys, that is. Domesticated turkeys have gotten too big to fly around. But they can still run very fast! \nAnd what are all those complicated structures on a turkey\u2019s head? Wattle, carbuncle, snood, beard?

      "description": "Reindeer are a species of deer that live way up close to the North Pole, where it\u2019s very cold. \nArctic Tundra: https://youtu.be/UzKKrqRtcow\nReindeer actually go by two different names. In North America, wild reindeer are called CARIBOU. In Northern Europe and Asia, they are called REINDEER. But when caribou become domesticated in North America, that is, kept in herds by people, we call them reindeer again.\nSome scientists think the reindeer was one of the first domesticated animals - way back around 2000 years ago. Some people who live in the Arctic still depend on reindeer for meat, milk, clothing, and even transportation. You\u2019ve heard of Santa\u2019s sleigh, right? That\u2019s the idea.\n\nIn this video, you'll learn all about Reindeer and how they are specially adapted to live in the cold. We'll show you how you can tell the difference between reindeer and other deer - it's all about the antlers! \n\nMany people associate reindeer with Christmas.  Legend tells of a very kind man named Santa Claus who has a magical sleigh, pulled by a team of flying reindeer. Do you know all the names of Santa's reindeer? We'll learn about those, too!\n\nCome learn more about Reindeer with us! \n\nAnd if you\u2019re curious about other Arctic Animals, we have a video for you:\nhttp://bit.ly/ArcticOceanAnimals\n\nSUBSCRIBE for more SMART + FUN kids videos!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe recommend these SMART + FUN books and activities for kids:\n\nOlive the Other Reindeer\nhttps://amzn.to/2QTXhe9\n\nStanding Reindeer Soft Toy Animal from Living Nature\nhttps://amzn.to/2LjK8FS\n\nNational Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Animals\nhttp://amzn.to/2sb4d6L\n\nNational Geographic Cutest Animals Sticker Activity Book: Over 1000 Stickers!\nhttp://amzn.to/2u8y6q1\n\nNational Geographic Animal Encyclopedia: 2500 Animals with Photos, Maps, and More!\nhttp://amzn.to/2swBuJ8\n\nNational Geographic Wild Animal Atlas: Earth\u2019s Astonishing Animals and Where They Live\nhttp://amzn.to/2tvOO4x\n\nFind more great resources on Amazon Free Time Unlimited\nUnlimited access to 13,000 kid-friendly books, movies, TV shows, educational apps, and games.\nhttp://amzn.to/2DGtlJ6\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nOur Animals for Kids videos are for kids who LOVE animals!  \nLearning about animals is a great way to keep kids excited about their natural world.

      "description": "Happy 2019, the Year of the Pig!  We grow up with pigs in Nursery Rhymes (this little piggy went to the market) and storybooks (Charlotte\u2019s Web, The Three Little Pigs) - but how much do you really know about these clever animals?  For instance, did you know that pigs dream like us?  And they can get a sunburn like us? \n\nPigs have been a part of human culture for thousands of years. Everywhere people live, there are pigs!

      "description": "Do you believe the Groundhog can predict when Spring will arrive?  Legend says that when a groundhog wakes up from hibernation and peeks out of its burrow, if it sees its shadow it gets scared and hides back underground. That means 6 more weeks of winter!  \nWe celebrate this legend every February 2nd on Groundhog Day.  But how much do you know about these cute little rodents? Did you know that they make tunnels called Burrows that get up to 20 meters long? And did you know that each burrow is for something special? They have a burrow to sleep, a burrow to hibernate, a burrow to have baby groundhogs, and even a bathroom burrow!\n\nThere\u2019s also a fun tongue twister associated with the groundhog. The groundhog is also known as the Woodchuck (it has a lot of other nicknames, too).  The famous tongue-twister is:\n\nHow much wood would a woodchuck chuck\nIf a woodchuck could chuck wood? \nA woodchuck would chuck all the wood he could\nIf a woodchuck could chuck wood. \n\nLet\u2019s have a contest!

We often call it Chinese New Year, but the Lunar New Year is celebrated in many Asian countries. It's based on the phases of the moon! The first day of the Lunar New Year begins on the New Moon that appears between January 21st and February 20th. \n\nOur friend the Moon is here to explain this beautiful and exciting holiday. We should say holidays, because the Lunar New Year celebration lasts for 15 days!  It's the longest national holidays. Many people travel from all over to visit with their families, and kids even get a whole month off from school!\n\nThe Lunar New Year is associated with the Chinese Zodiac. There is a small cycle of 12 years, each year denoted by a special animal sign. These are the Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Sheep (or Goat), Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig. Then the cycle begins again! \n\nIn this video, we'll learn about the traditional activities that take place on each of the 15 days of the Lunar New Year celebrations, including eating special foods, setting off fireworks, receiving red envelopes with money inside, and lighting special red lanterns. \n\nWe have a special video about the 12 Chinese Zodiac Animals!

      "description": "What is that funny looking symbol? It\u2019s the Greek Letter Pi. It looks like a crooked little table! But it is important in math and physics and LIFE. Did you know that pi will help you figure out how much pizza you have? How big is your cookie? You can use pi to understand anything that is shaped like a circle. \nPi is an interesting number. It never ends! It starts out \n3.141 5926 5358 9793 2384\u2026 but it just keeps going, and going, and going\u2026Most of the time we shorten pi to a few digits. In this video we use 3.14, but you can use more digits if you like.  In fact, some people make it a game to memorize as many digits of pi as they can. \n\nIn this video, our puppet friend Charlie celebrates Pi Day by learning about the definition of pi:\nPi is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its diameter.  This also means that if you know the circumference of a circle, you can find its diameter. Or if you know its diameter, you can find the circumference!\n\nPi is also in the equation for the Area of a circle.  The area of a circle is pi times the radius squared. (The radius is one half of the circle\u2019s diameter).  This is the formula that Charlie is REALLY excited about, because it lets him figure out what is a better deal: one 18-inch pizza or two 12-inch pizzas. Do you know?  Let\u2019s find out, using Pi!\n\nDo you celebrate Pi Day on March 14th (3-14)? \nThere's also Pi Approximation Day, July 22nd (22/7).  Another chance to celebrate!\n How many digits of Pi do you know by heart?

      "description": "Do your kids want to understand Black Holes? Now's the perfect time to learn about black holes since the Event Horizon Telescope just got its first picture of M87, the black hole in the galaxy Messier 87. \n\nOur puppet friends Kromp & Leonard talk about how black holes form from dying stars, and what it means for a black hole to be \"invisible.\"  We can't take a regular photograph of a black hole, because it absorbs light and no light can escape from the Event Horizon.  \n\nSo how does the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) work? It's an array of RADIO telescopes networked all around the world, and it's detecting radio waves coming off of the accretion disk, the bright burning disk of dust and gas swirling around M87.  \n\nTake a look at the first picture of M87 from the EHT, and Kromp and Leonard will explain what you are looking at! \n\nDon't forget to SUBSCRIBE for more SMART + FUN videos!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe Recommend the fun and educational delivery boxes from Steven Spangler:\n\nSpangler Science Club - Interactive Science Activities delivered every month\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1241388&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\nFor Teachers: Really Good Box of Stuff - new themed educational box delivered each month (something for you and something for your class)\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1223138&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nTry another Astronomy video:\n\nThe Moon   http://bit.ly/Moon4Kids\nLunar Eclipse  http://bit.ly/LunarEclipseForKids\nSolar Eclipse  http://bit.ly/Astronomy_Kids\nIs This a Planet  http://bit.ly/Planet_Game\nMercury for Kids  http://bit.ly/Planet_Mercury\nStars & Constellations  http://bit.ly/StarsForKids\n\nBe sure to SUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss our next episode!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe recommend these fun space-themed books and toys for kids:\nNational Geographic Kids First Big Book of Space\nhttp://amzn.to/2qQ39np\n\nGlow in the dark Stars from Addie & Emma\u2019s\nhttp://amzn.to/2vJwdEq\n\nSolar System Mobile (includes Pluto)\nhttp://amzn.to/2f4cEQh\n\nAnd we love this beautiful Moon in My Room nightlight! \nhttp://amzn.to/2rBhyb2\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nPerformed by Cassi Jerkins and Michael Rosenbaum\nWritten & Produced by Kimberly Hatch Harrison\n\nCreative Commons Picture Credits:\nThe Event Horizon Telescope and Global mm-VLBI Array on the Earth\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Event_Horizon_Telescope_and_Global_mm-VLBI_Array_on_the_Earth.jpg\nhttps://www.eso.org/public/images/ann17015a/ \nAuthor ESO/O.

It\u2019s a holiday celebrating TREES.  The name Arbor Day comes from the Latin Word for tree. On Arbor Day, we visit trees, sit under trees, hug trees, and even plant trees. Arbor Day doesn\u2019t always on the same day every year, but it\u2019s usually in the Spring when the ground isn\u2019t frozen anymore. That makes it easier to plant trees!\n\nArbor Day is celebrated in many places around the world. Do you celebrate Arbor Day where you live? \n\nIn this video hosted by our mascot Bertie the Owlet, we talk about the many reasons to love and celebrate trees!  We learn about the history of Arbor Day, back to its earliest celebrations in Spain, and then how it got a big start in the United States, and finally spreading all over the world. \n\nWe also play a fun \u201cmystery tree\u201d game - can you guess the 3 mystery trees? \n\nLearn what Arbor Day is all about with us! \n\nIf you love learning about science and nature, subscribe to Socratica Kids!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\nHere's our playlist of Special Days for Kids.

      "description": "Do you know how Volcanoes Work? What makes Volcanoes Erupt? Mother Earth is here to explain. \nVolcanoes are openings on the Earth\u2019s surface where LAVA escapes. Confused about Lava vs Magma? Lava is another word for molten rock (magma) when it escapes above the Earth\u2019s crust. \n\nIn this video, we\u2019ll learn about the layers of the Earth, and how the core (the very center) is VERY hot and under a lot of pressure. It\u2019s so hot, it heats up the other layers, and some of the rocky layers underground melt into MAGMA. Eventually the pressure builds up, and the magma escapes to the surface as LAVA!  \n\nHave you ever seen a volcano erupting? At the end of our video, you\u2019ll get to see a VOLCANO MONTAGE so be sure to watch to the end for that exciting finish! \n\nSUBSCRIBE to Socratica Kids for more SMART + FUN videos!\nhttp://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\nWe Recommend the fun and educational delivery boxes from Steven Spangler:\n\nSpangler Science Club - Interactive Science Activities delivered every month\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1241388&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\nFor Teachers: Really Good Box of Stuff - new themed educational box delivered each month (something for you and something for your class)\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1223138&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nDo you love nature videos?

What makes them different colours? In this video, you\u2019ll learn about the invention of fireworks and how modern fireworks actually work.  There are three main stages to most fireworks: 1) the fuse, 2) the lift charge, and 3) the burst charge. Our friend Puppet Charlie explains what goes into these fireworks and also where the different colours come from. We also learn a big word: pyrotechnician - that means someone who works with fireworks as their job. \n\nWe watch fireworks on New Years, the 4th of July, and for many other holidays around the world!

      "description": "What\u2019s the secret to being a good student? It may seem like a mystery, but here at Socratica Kids, we\u2019ll show you how!  Our puppet friends Leonard, Topher, and Rita Fox show you how to do well in school. \n\nTopher is a good student. He listens to his teacher, Rita Fox, who is there to help the students. Leonard still has a little way to go, but anyone can be a good student. Here are a few simple tips to remember:  Show up on time, eat a good breakfast, listen to your teacher, follow the rules, do your homework, raise your hand, use your inside voice, and...no personal parties!  What\u2019s that last one about? You\u2019ll see!\n\nDo you find school challenging?  We\u2019d love to hear from teachers and students about what they find hard, and what they find fun about school.

      "description": "Anyone can learn to draw! All you need is paper to doodle on, and some pencils or crayons.  Today, Ziggy the Doodlebug teaches you a special technique for drawing a CIRCLE. Can you think of things shaped like a circle? We think of a whole bunch together, like a ball, an orange, a clock...We also learn all the names for the parts of a circle! These words come from MATH and it\u2019s important to know what they mean!\n\nThe Center: The middle of the circle.\nRadius: The distance from the center of the circle to its outer rim.\nChord: A line segment connecting two points on the circle.\nArc: Connect two points on the circle by drawing along the circle\u2019s edge. \nDiameter: The distance across the circle when you go through the center. The length of a diameter is two times the length of the radius. This cuts the circle in half!\nCircumference:  The distance all around the edge of the circle.\nArea: How much space the circle takes up. It tells you how much coloring you have to do to fill the whole circle. \n\nSUBSCRIBE for more SMART + FUN videos! http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe Recommend the fun and educational delivery boxes from Steven Spangler:\n\nSpangler Science Club - Interactive Science Activities delivered every month\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1241388&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\nFor Teachers: Really Good Box of Stuff - new themed educational box delivered each month (something for you and something for your class)\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1223138&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\n\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\nDo you love to draw?

Trees sprout from seeds, just like flowers, but then they grow MUCH MUCH taller. In this video, we\u2019ll talk about HOW trees do it! They don\u2019t grow bigger all over, like you do. They only grow in very special areas. We\u2019ll learn about a special kind of tissue in trees called MERISTEM. We\u2019ll also play a game - can you guess the tree, if you see its seed? Watch and find out! \n\nSocratica Kids is proud to be part of #TeamTrees!  #TeamTrees is a collaboration of your favourite YouTubers who are working together to plant 20 MILLION trees by January 1st, 2020.  We\u2019re raising funds with the help of the Arbor Day Foundation, who are known around the world for planting and supporting beautiful trees. \n\nIf you want to join #TeamTrees, visit teamtrees.org.  Be sure to get the help of your grownup.  \nThe goal is to raise $20 million dollars by 1/1/2020. That comes out to $1 per tree. What a bargain! \nThe Arbor Day Foundation is working hard to find where in the world are the best places to plant these 20 million trees - where are they needed and where will they grow well. That way the trees can grow strong and healthy, and can contribute to a healthier planet for all of us! \n\nWe have a related video all about Arbor Day:\nhttp://bit.ly/ArborDay4Kids\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nWe Recommend the fun and educational delivery boxes from Steven Spangler:\n\nSpangler Science Club - Interactive Science Activities delivered every month\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1241388&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\nFor Teachers: Really Good Box of Stuff - new themed educational box delivered each month (something for you and something for your class)\nhttps://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1223138&u=1564522&m=81604&urllink=&afftrack=\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nHere are some books and activities we love for curious kids:\nWhat Tree is That (Guide to Common North American Trees)\nhttps://amzn.to/2XGj2Ob\n\nUltimate Explorer Field Guide: Trees\nhttps://amzn.to/2MJr2v1\n\nThe Halloween Tree by Ray Bradbury\nhttps://amzn.to/366AVur\n\nAmerica\u2019s National Parks (Lonely Planet Kids)\nhttps://amzn.to/2okPda0\n\nBonsai Tree Starter Kit\nhttps://amzn.to/2NdnWOS\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\nOur Animals for Kids videos are for kids who LOVE animals!  \nLearning about animals is a great way to keep kids excited about their natural world.

Scientists estimated that dogs were domesticated, or made pet-friendly, 15,000 years ago. Wow!

Our lessons are clear and simple to follow. There are no distractions of music or sound effects. By staying completely focused on learning to read, it just takes about 10 minutes to get through each lesson. \n\nEach reading lesson builds on the previous one, so it\u2019s important to sign up to our mailing list so you don\u2019t miss any lessons. \n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a: https//snu.socratica.org/learn-to-read\n\nIn Lesson 1, we learn the sound m.

Recognizing phonemes and being able to sound out words is an important step that eliminates most of the guesswork that causes struggles for beginning readers.\n\nIn this lesson, we also see and pronounce these words:\nmat\nram\nme\nam\nman\nham\nmad\njam\n\nIn the word list, there are words that begin with the m sound, and there are words that end with the m sound. We practice reading and saying these words both slowly and quickly. This way students get practice with \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5c \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude68 together to make words.  \nThis phonics practice with blending is an essential part of learning how to read. \n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud835\ude47\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 2 (\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59): https://youtu.be/9sYovtqQVHk\n\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude47\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e (soothing): https://youtu.be/5rw0aR5QdM4\n\ud835\ude4b\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude69 (funny): https://youtu.be/Vl5g0G4DdRg\n\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude46\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a: http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\nThis series of reading lessons was made possible by the Socratica Foundation.

Our lessons are clear and simple to follow. There are no distractions of music or sound effects. By staying completely focused on learning to read, it just takes about 10 minutes to get through each lesson. \n\nEach reading lesson builds on the previous one, so it\u2019s important to sign up to our mailing list so you don\u2019t miss any lessons. \n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude67 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude5a: https//snu.socratica.org/learn-to-read\n\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude6c\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d \ud835\ude47\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63 1 (\ud835\ude62 \ud835\ude68\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59):  https://youtu.be/hAqk1NnPU_I\n\nIn Lesson 9, We learn a new sound, n. We review the sound m, which sounds similar to n.

Recognizing phonemes and being able to sound out words is an important step that eliminates most of the guesswork that causes struggles for beginning readers.\n\nIn this lesson, we also see and pronounce these words:\nnap\nmap\ncan\nman\nham\nran\nmat\npan\nSam\nfan\nme\nin\n\nIn the word list, we are reviewing some of the words from previous lessons that use both of the m and n sounds. We practice reading and saying these words both slowly and quickly.

But did you know that the time it takes for the Earth to go around the sun is actually a little bit longer than that? It's about 365 and a quarter days!\n\nThat extra quarter day might not seem like a lot, but over time, it adds up. After four years, those quarter days add up to one extra day. That's why we have Leap Year!\n\nA leap year is a year that has one extra day in it. It happens every four years, and that extra day is added to the month of February. So instead of having 28 days, February has 29 days in a leap year.\n\nWatch more videos about special days here: \n  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_qTKPgjtfbbBd0OiutnzDupkXAv-vS-M\nSocratica Kids = SMART + FUN\n\nBe sure to SUBSCRIBE so you don\u2019t miss our next episode!\n\u21aa http://bit.ly/SocraticaKids\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\n\nThis video was made possible by the Socratica Foundation.

      "description": "The first day of spring is a special day when the weather starts to get warmer, the trees and flowers start to grow new leaves and buds, and the days start to get longer. Spring is the season that comes after winter, and it's a time of renewal and new beginnings.\n\nDuring the first day of spring, which is also called the \"spring equinox,\" the sun is in a special position in the sky that makes the day and night almost equal in length.

These include being able to hold their breath for a long time, having a blowhole on top of their heads so they can quickly grab a breath of fresh air when they surface, special flippers that help them swim quickly through the water - they can even do something called ECHOLOCATION that allows them to find their way around and hunt for prey even in dark murky waters. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude63 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:41 Dolphins are Mammals\n1:10 Different Kinds of dolphins\n1:25 How big are they?\n1:44 How fast are they?\n1:57 Porpoising (leaping)\n2:15 Deep diving\n2:27 Using their tail & flippers\n2:35 Breathing with a blowhole\n3:15 Holding their breath\n3:24 Sleeping\n3:55 Interesting bodies\n5:37 Hunting for food\n6:17 Live in pods\n6:38 Dolphin babies (calf)\n7:40 Communication\n8:04 Echolocation\n8:33 Helping people\n\nWant to play \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 games about these animals?\nWe have \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68 that tie in with this video available here:\n\ud83c\udfa8 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/hszhq\n\ud83e\udde9 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/oqjrnq\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83d\udc33 Ocean Animals https://youtu.be/JOJkvhSpBiQ\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\ud83d\udc19 Octopus https://youtu.be/fHRS3bD4yPM\n\nFind more free courses and bonus goodies on our Foundation website here:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\nThis channel is made possible by The Socratica Foundation.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

They must be the hardest working insects in the world! They do a lot of the hard work needed to pollinate flowers and help plants grow. They also make honey, which is delicious, and beeswax, which they use to make their honeycomb (and we use in candles). \n\nLike all insects, bees have 3 main body parts as all insects: head, thorax, and abdomen. But bees have some additional special structures you'll learn about in this video including a HONEY STOMACH, POLLEN BASKETS, and a STINGER!\n\nWe'll also find out more about how pollination works, how honey is made from nectar, and how bees live their complicated, highly social life back at the beehive.

There are more than 350,000 different species of beetles\u2014that we know of so far! They are amazingly specialized for where they live and what they eat. You can tell this because it's their jaw and mouthparts that are so radically different between different species of beetles. \n\nBut you know what they all have in common? Beetles are all insects! That means they share some features with all insects: they have 3 main body parts (head, thorax, and abdomen), they have compound eyes and antennae for sensing things, they have 2 sets of wings, and 6 jointed legs. And instead of a skeleton made of bones inside their body, they have an exoskeleton. \n\nIn this video, we'll meet 10 beetles that are all special in their own way.

If you need help remembering that, just think: Dinosaurs and Pterosaurs were reptiles! The dinosaurs went extinct around 65 million years ago, but we still live with their descendants. Modern reptiles include snakes, lizards, turtle, crocodiles, alligators, geckos, komodo dragons, tortoises...can you think of any others?\n\nIn this video, you'll see many different reptiles and you'll learn about what they have in common and what distinguishes them from one another. For instance, reptiles are all \"cold-blooded\" (the scientific term is ectothermic), which actually means their body temperature is influenced by their surroundings.

This is the reality for many creatures on Earth. That's right, we're talking about nocturnal animals! These are the critters that sleep during the day and come alive at night. From the silent flight of owls to the sneakiest of sneaky foxes, we're taking a peek at the mysterious lives of these nighttime wanderers. It\u2019s time to turn on your flashlight and shed some light on these nighttime creatures. \nWhen the sun sets and we're winding down for the night, nocturnal animals are just getting started. Animals who are active during the night are called NOCTURNAL animals. On the other hand, animals who are active during the day, like humans, are called DIURNAL. But it doesn\u2019t end there\u2026there\u2019s actually a special term for animals who are active during the in-between times of dusk and dawn: CREPUSCULAR animals! That\u2019s a fun word to say. CRE-PUS-CU-LAR.  Crepuscular animals include cats, some owls, and even some species of bats. But today, we\u2019ll be focusing on animals who thrive during the dark hours of the night. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro/ what are nocturnal animals?\n1:20 Owls\n1:57 Rodents (mice, rats)\n2:33 Crickets\n3:13 Cockroaches\n3:54 Fox\n4:34 Bats\n5:20 Moths\n6:28 Group of similar animals: opossum, skunk, badger, porcupine, hedgehog, nine-banded armadillo\n7:11 Raccoon\n7:41 Nightingale\n8:22 Frogs\n9:04 Fireflies\n\nWant to play \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 games about these animals?\nWe have \ud835\ude56\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude6b\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude5c\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude68 that tie in with this video available here:\n\ud83c\udfa8 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/mfoowq\n\ud83e\udde9 https://socraticafoundation.gumroad.com/l/mctgp\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83d\udc1e10 Beetles https://youtu.be/YfFoVuU0mFc\n\ud83d\udc01 City Animals https://youtu.be/2b7H94vUnWw\n\ud83e\udd89 Owls https://youtu.be/9UzCR2wmmjg\n\n\nFind more free courses and bonus goodies on our Foundation website here:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\nThis channel is made possible by The Socratica Foundation.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nDo you know how volcanoes work?\nVolcanoes are NOT like other mountains, sitting all quiet and pretty. They have a lot going on inside! It gets so hot, rocks melt (we call this molten rock magma). Pressure builds up, and eventually they ERUPT! \n\nWhat comes out of a volcano? When the molten rock is on the outside, now we call it LAVA. But that's not all. There are also a variety of gases (like carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide) and ash (very fine particles of rocks, minerals, and glass). \n\nIn this video, you'll see many different volcanoes and learn about how they work.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nHurricanes are massive storms that form over warm ocean waters. Depending on where you live, you might call them typhoons, or cyclones. Did you know these were three different names for the same kind of giant storm?\n\nWhen we say giant storm, we mean GIANT storm\u2014hurricanes can be hundreds of miles across. And they look a lot like a spiral galaxy!  How else will you recognize hurricanes? They have an open spot in the middle called the EYE, and surrounding the eye is the EYE WALL.  See also the spiral rain bands.  And the hurricane twists in one direction in the Northern Hemisphere, and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. \n\nIn this video, you'll see examples of hurricanes and learn about how they work.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nWhen you say tsunami, do you know you're speaking Japanese? Tsunami is made up of two Japanese words: tsu (harbor) + nami (wave). So tsunami means \"harbor wave\" in Japanese. Why were they named this? Because these are the kind of giant waves that destroyed harbors. \n\nThese waves don't play nice on the beach for us to splash in. Tsunami waves stretch up way up tall like a giant wall made of water, rushing onto the shore and mowing down everything in their path. \n\nIn this video, we'll learn about the special ways tsunamis are different from ordinary waves. Where do they come from? How fast do they move? Where on Earth are they most common? What can we do to prepare for them? \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:52 What causes a tsunami?\n1:25 What does tsunami mean in Japanese?\n1:59 Speed\n2:33 Wavelength (distance between peaks)\n3:33 Tsunami waves\n4:17 Height\n4:51 Where do tsunamis happen?\n5:34 Warning signs\n6:25 Staying prepared\n7:14 Famous tsunamis\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

You'll look at our poster and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nWhirlpools are something we can experience in our own homes (on a small scale): you can watch water draining out of your sink or your bathtup or even the toilet! But whirlpools are also a natural phenomenon. They usually happen when two different currents, going in different directions, meet in a body of water. These can happen in the ocean, in a river, or even a lake. \n\nWe're used to stories and myths about GIANT whirlpools sucking down ships. But actually, in nature, whirlpools rarely pull in boats. If you know what to look for, you can avoid them! Also some whirlpools are pretty small. But some are very large, and are even tourist attractions! \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:34  What Are Whirlpools?\n1:17 How big are they?\n2:06 What causes whirlpools?\n3:12 How long do they last?\n4:14 How do you recognize them?\n4:37 Are whirlpools dangerous?\n5:15 Famous whirlpools\n5:56 Whirlpools in mythology\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0a Tsunami https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

All of these floods have one big thing in common: there's a lot of water where there usually isn't any. This can happen quickly or slowly, depending on the type of flood. \n\nIn this video, we'll learn about these different kinds of floods and what causes them. When a flood happens, it can bring about a lot of changes. Mostly bad, but would you believe there are some positive things that can come out of a flood, too? We'll talk about it.

OR...like a snowball rolling down a hill, getting bigger and bigger as it goes. Did you know there are different kinds of avalanches?\n\nIn this video, we talk about several different kinds of avalanches: slab avalanches, wet avalanches, and loose slow avalanches. We also learn about where avalanches are more likely to happen, and what causes them\u2014both in the short-term, but also what are some underlying circumstances that make avalanches take place. \n\nThere are steps you can take to avoid being caught in avalanches, but just in case it happens, we also talk about how to make it more likely you will survive and be found by search and rescue teams. Finally, we take a peek at some of the steps people are taking to prevent avalanches from happening in the first place.  \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro\n0:37 Definition * Types\n1:53 Causes\n3:13 Climate Change\n4:08 Safety Precautions\n5:09 What to Do in an Avalanche\n5:59 Search & Rescue\n6:47 Prevention\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

These are LANDSLIDES. \nDid you know there are different kinds of landslides? Slides, flows, falls, and topples. You'll learn how to tell them apart in this video! \n\nWhat causes landslides? Sometimes it's completely natural, but this is one of those acts of nature that people sometimes influence (especially by deforestation).

EARTHQUAKES happen when tectonic plates move against each other. You can picture tectonic plates like gigantic puzzle pieces that make up all of the Earth's crust. \nIn this video we'll talk about some of the causes of Earthquakes, and how scientists study them using special tools like seismographs. We'll learn how to describe the size of earthquakes using the Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale.

But somehow we escaped that fate. Today, let's learn about what quicksand actually is (not a type of sand!) and how to get out if you ever actually see some and fall in. \nIt's a lot harder to get out of tar pits, as evidenced by the many fossils found in them. Have you ever been to the La Brea Tar Pits or another tar pit? We'll take a look at how they are formed and why it was so hard for the prehistoric animals to escape them.

And you get both thunder and lightning in THUNDERSTORMS. \n\nToday we'll talk about how thunderstorms happen. First, we'll look at the special clouds involved: CUMULONIMBUS clouds. Next we'll think about what happens inside the clouds that leads to electricity building up and eventually discharging in the form of lightning. \nDid you know there are different kinds of lightning? We will talk about the several kinds that can happen during thunderstorms, including cloud to cloud lightning, and cloud to ground lightning. There are more.

You'll look at it and laugh, and then remember what it says. \n\nTornadoes aren't just found in movies like Twister (and Twisters) and the Wizard of Oz. They're a real natural phenomenon with enormous power. In this video we'll learn what causes tornadoes, and what situations make them more likely to occur. This has to do with geography (places like \"Tornado Alley\" are more likely to have tornadoes) but also just the right weather conditions.\n\nNot all tornadoes are the same, and we'll learn about supercell and non-supercell tornadoes. Then there's a variety of intensities\u2014meteorologists (weather scientists) use the Fujita scale so we all know just how big of a tornado we're talking about. \n\nDid you hear the term \"mesocyclone?\" You'll come across this term again in our video about thunderstorms.

They each have a distinct  climate, with plants and animals that are well-suited to live there. \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude44\ud835\ude3d\ud835\ude40 so you get to see each new video!\n\nWhere do you call home? That is, where would Mother Nature say you live? When we're talking about nature and ecology, it doesn't matter what city, state,  or country you live in. We're talking about BIOMES, which are like nature's neighborhoods. \nThere are 5 or 11 different biomes, depending on who you ask. The basic 5 are Aquatic, Desert, Forest, Grassland, and Tundra. These can be further split up into 11! Each of these biomes are home to distinct plants and animals (flora and fauna) that are well adapted for the specific sort of climate found in that biome. \nSo for instance, the desert is known for having very little rainfall, and most deserts get pretty hot. So the plants and animals that live there have evolved to have adaptations well-suited for that set of living conditions. The plants don't have big broad leaves that would wilt in the sun. Instead they have spikes or spines, like cacti. The animals tend to be small, and are more active at night, when it's cooler, and often have big ears to cool off. Compare that with animals that live in the cold, where they are more likely to be bigger but have little ears, and layers of blubber for insulation to stay warm. \n\nIn this series, we'll look at the 11 different biomes that ecologists study. We'll discuss the specific climate, plants, and animals found in each biome. We are planning a follow-up series that goes into greater depth about the animals in each biome.

But Tropical Grasslands is a phrase that ecologists use to describe a very specific biome. This is a place close to the equator, that stays comfortably warm all year long, and supports a wide variety of different plants and animals (flora and fauna). Including GRASS! \nIf you think about going on Safari to see animals like Lions, Giraffes, Wildebeest, etc. you'll have a good idea what Tropical Grasslands (also known as the savanna) is like.

The word \"Temperate\" lets you know that this is not a place of extremes, but rather sort of average! There are four seasons, but still it never gets TOO hot or TOO cold. That's partly because there is fairly consistent precipitation, and the water vapor in the air helps maintain the even temperature. Compare that with the desert, where the temps can swing wildly from burning hot to freezing cold in the same day. \nIn this video, we'll look at the characteristic plants of the Temperate Forest Biome - it should come as no surprise that trees are involved in a forest, but you may not know that it's especially the trees that change color in autumn that can be found here. We also meet some of the animals that call this biome home. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Temperate Forest\n0:52 What is a Biome?\n1:34 The Four Seasons\n3:51 Precipitation in the Temperate Forest\n4:43 Types of Temperate Forest\n6:19 What are the Plants like?\n8:01 What are the Animals like?\n\nHave you seen our video on the BOREAL FOREST Biome?\n\ud83c\udf32 https://youtu.be/eq9XvKeM0kc\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

But did you know you can also have a COLD desert, with ice sheets, lichen, and penguins? Antarctica is also considered a desert! It's because what makes a desert isn't the heat, but the lack of precipitation. So we have a variety of different deserts around the world\u2014some hot, some cold, but all of them are very dry. \nIn this video, we'll look at the desert biome and the plants and animals that call it home. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Introduction\n0:53 Definition of Desert\n1:45 What\u2019s a Biome\n2:26 Climate - Hot or Cold\n4:41 Desert Plants\n6:08 Desert Animals\n7:53 Visit the Deserts\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

Polar Bears, reindeer, and the big guy himself, SANTA. But what about the South Pole? Who lives there? \nThe icy, frozen land at the south pole is a special biome known as the Antarctic Tundra, and it's home to some unusually adapted plants and animals that can survive the harsh conditions. It's the coldest place on Earth, and it's also one of the driest. That's right - it gets so little precipitation, it's technically a desert!\nIn this video, we'll learn more about the climate, the times of year when it's all sun or no sun, and the special plants and animals that live there.

A biome is not just a place, but also the climate, plants and animals that live there because they are well-suited for life in those conditions. In the case of the Tropical Forest biome, it's always warm, because in the tropics (areas close to the equator), the amount of sunshine throughout the year is fairly constant. There's also abundant rainfall. This means a lot of plant life, which means in turn a lot of animal life! There's a huge diversity of flora and fauna in the Tropical Forest Biome. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Tropical Forest\n0:52 Definition of this Biome\n2:27 At the Equator\n3:46 Weather & Climate\n5:18 Forest Layers\n6:57 Rainforest Plants\n8:18 Rainforest Animals\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

The whole center part of the United States is mostly this biome, and is nicknamed the \"Country's Breadbasket.\" It's not just home to a lot of our agriculture. As a biome, it serves as the natural habitat for a variety of plant and animal life including wild grasses (hence the name), wildflowers, bison, rabbits, mice, prairie dogs, etc. \nMuch of this kind of land has been developed for agricultural purposes, not just in the US but all around the world. In this video, we'll consider the changes that have been made, and if there's a way to get back to a more sustainable situation in this important biome. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro - Temperate Grassland = breadbasket\n1:14 Definition of Biome\n2:30 Where on Earth\n4:26 Climate\n5:55  Plants\n7:00 Animals\n8:40 Agriculture\n\nWant to take home a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4f+\ud835\ude41\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude49 souvenir?\n\ud83d\udc55 https://shop.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43 \ud835\ude49\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude53\ud835\ude4f:\n\ud83c\udf0e Biomes https://youtu.be/TCQUKmTgX4c\n\ud83c\udfd4\ufe0f Avalanches https://youtu.be/7af1AoNLlY4\n\ud83c\udf0bVolcanic Eruptions https://youtu.be/icZUt-C2VKM\n\ud83c\udf00 Hurricane, Typhoon, & Cyclone https://youtu.be/edSv8nK3aMI\n\ud83c\udf0a TSUNAMIS https://youtu.be/vwkeXohc_N4\n\u26ab Black Holes https://youtu.be/RayH5j1VGS8\n\ud83e\udd88 Sharks https://youtu.be/Roik25sdvuM\n\nFind free courses & bonus goodies on our Foundation website:\n\ud83e\udd89 https://www.socratica.org\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude48\ud835\ude40\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude3f:\n\ud83d\udcda National Geographic Kids World Atlas\nhttps://amzn.to/3LwHQmH\n\n\ud83d\udcda \n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. \n\nIn this video, we take a closer look at the animals that are able to live in the specific conditions of the TROPICAL GRASSLAND, aka the Savanna Biome: fairly constant temperature, because this biome is found along the equator where there are similar hours of daylight all year long. But there is a distinct wet season and dry season. Animals who live here have to be specially adapted to handle both of these extremes. Could you do this? \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Savanna Biome conditions\n1:14 African Elephant\n2:31 Lion\n3:31 Giraffe\n4:48 Cheetah\n6:01 Zebra\n6:56 African Wild Dog\n8:11 Biomes Course\n8:37 Warthog\n9:48 Hyena\n11:00 Dung Beetle\n12:00 Ostrich\n13:28 Secretary Bird\n14:34 Meerkat\n\n\ud83e\udd81 Savanna/ Tropical Grassland Biome: https://youtu.be/IJhSgu32haA\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. \n\nIn this video, we take a closer look at the animals that are able to live in the conditions of the Desert Biome. Deserts are found all over the world, and what they have in common is very little rainfall. We also tend to think of deserts being hot places, but did you know there are cold deserts as well? If you'd like to learn more about that, check out our Desert Biome video next. \n\nIn this video, we're focusing on the adaptations the animal residents of the desert have, that make them well-suited for life there. How do they get by in such a dry place? Do they have strategies for conserving water? Sometimes these adaptations are physical, sometimes, behavioral. See if you can notice the difference for each animal we talk about! \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Desert Biome adaptations\n0:59 Fennec Fox\n2:03 Dromedary Camel\n3:11 Sidewinder Snake\n4:10 Gila Monster\n5:16 Roadrunner\n6:16 Desert Tortoise\n7:10 Biomes Series\n7:35 Kangaroo Rat\n8:35 Scorpion \n9:28 Coyote\n10:19 Meerkat \n11:06 Bearded Dragon\n\n\ud83c\udf35 Desert Biome: https://youtu.be/mvRxt4F0Qo4\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

At first glance, it doesn't look like there's much life here in this frozen place that doesn't get a lot of sunlight for much of the year. But look closer, and you'll see many different kinds of penguins and seals, both of which spend some of their time on land, and some in the frigid waters. Once in the water, you'll find giants like orcas and blue whales, along with teeny tiny animals like krill. How do these animals handle the cold? We'll look at some of the special adaptations, both physical and behavioral, that allow a few special animals to thrive in this biome. \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to the Antarctic Tundra Biome\n1:05 Emperor Penguin\n3:08 Weddell Seal\n4:40 Antarctic Krill\n5:44 Leopard Seal\n7:22 Snow Petrel\n8:28 Antarctic Midge\n9:58 Orca (Killer Whale)\n11:25 Gentoo Penguin\n12:26 South Polar Skua\n13:39 Ad\u00e9lie Penguin\n14:28 Blue Whale\n\n\ud835\ude52\ud835\ude3c\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude43\n\ud83d\udc27 Antarctic Tundra Biome https://youtu.be/cIJa26i0cPc\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. Snakes are unusual in that they are adapted to do well in many different biomes. \n\nOf course, snakes are not all identical. Take a close look at the snakes in this video. They have special adaptations, both physical and behavioral, that make them well adapted to the environment they live in. \n\nIn this video, we'll learn more about what snakes are like. What do they eat? Can they sense the world (seeing, hearing, etc) like we do? How do they move around since they have no legs?  \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Some snakes have a secret (vestigial legs)\n0:46 Snake anatomy\n1:46 How do snakes move? \n3:31 What are snakes?

Let's meet the Animals that are specially adapted to live in each Biome. \n\nIn this video, we take a closer look at the animals that are able to live in the specific conditions of the TROPICAL FOREST biome. This is sometimes called the Rainforest, because of the extremely high amount of rainfall. All that humidity means the temperature is fairly stable. So you don't see animals that are especially adapted to extreme temperature fluctuations. Rather, we find a variety of animals that have special adaptations that allow them to thrive at different levels of this moist forest. Some animals live way up in the trees. Others live down on the forest floor. Can you imagine how these would require different physical and behavioral traits? \n\n\ud835\ude45\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude62\ud835\ude65 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5b\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude69 \ud835\ude69\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude65\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude5a:\n0:00 Intro to Tropical Forest Biome\n1:19 Jaguar\n2:10 Poison Dart Frog\n3:09 Harpy Eagle\n4:05 Sloth\n5:09 Capybara\n6:11 Howler Monkey\n7:16 Green Anaconda\n8:49 Toco Toucan\n9:50 Okapi\n10:42 Leafcutter Ant\n11:52 Baird's Tapir\n\n\n\ud83e\udd9c Tropical Forest Biome https://youtu.be/OK5rdXFOsjQ\n\nOur videos are perfect for classroom and homeschool use, encouraging middle school kids to think deeply about their environment and the animals we share our planet with.

She lives in Scandiland, where kids don't go to school but instead do real work in apprenticeships until they find what profession suits them. Astrid starts her journey in this episode. \n\nAstrid's Journal is an illustrated audiobook series perfect for fans of Harriet the Spy, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Ender's Game. In combination with the Reader's Guide Exercises, it is a robust introduction for students (grades 3-8) to the powerful techniques of journaling. \n\nKeeping a journal is one of the most appealing tools for developing writing skills. Journaling is also beneficial for emotional development, helping kids better understand the events in their lives, recognizing their responses, and how to deal with them constructively. \n\n\ud83d\udca1 Looking for a way to help your child develop a lifelong writing habit? \ud83d\udca1\nJournaling is a great way to encourage self-expression, build writing skills, and develop emotional intelligence. In this video, we introduce journaling in a kid-friendly way that makes it easy to get started! Whether your child is new to journaling or already loves writing, this introduction offers practical tips and creative ideas to help them find their voice. \nWatch our Introduction to Journal Writing for kids: \n\u270d\ufe0f https://youtu.be/_NvWo2lUwdU\n\n\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d \ud835\ude44\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4e\nThe focus of each episode of Astrid's Journal is to help students build strong foundational skills, meeting the Reading Standards for the Common Core for English Language Arts (Literature and Writing) for grades 3-5. Please see the attached PDF \"Reader's Guide\" that includes a variety of enrichment activities to extend the learning experience for the above mentioned areas, as well as writing exercises. Students will get experience reflecting on what they have read, as well as producing their own work through a series of journaling prompts for each episode. Note the interdisciplinary nature of the exercises, including history, geography, and math as well as language arts. \n\nFocus Domains:\nReading Foundational Skills\nReading Literature\nSpeaking and Listening\nWriting\n\n\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude58\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude5a\ud835\ude61 \ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude68 \ud835\ude62\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude65\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude68\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude57\ud835\ude61\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude57\ud835\ude6e \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude5d\ud835\ude5a \ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude67\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude58\ud835\ude56 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude6a\ud835\ude63\ud835\ude59\ud835\ude56\ud835\ude69\ud835\ude5e\ud835\ude64\ud835\ude63.\nThe Socratica Foundation is an educational nonprofit with the mission to build the essential, universal knowledge base every student needs to succeed.

Topics discussed in this video include the benefits of journaling for developing writing skills, as well as emotional intelligence. A few themes for journals are suggested, as well as the idea of more specific Journal Writing Prompts. Reading other journals is introduced, including those that are historical, as well as works of fiction. Two that we recommend are:\n\nThe Diary of a Young Girl, by Anne Frank\n \ud83d\udcd8 https://amzn.to/4iLZlyq\n\nHarriet the Spy, by Louise Fitzhugh\n  \ud83d\udcd8  https://amzn.to/3XAQoiR\n\nIncluded in this video is a preview of our new Illustrated Audiobook series, \"Astrid's Journal.\" Participating in this series is a truly interactive way to get kids reading, listening, and writing.

She lives in Scandiland, where kids don't go to school but instead do real work in apprenticeships until they find what profession suits them. Astrid starts her journey in this episode. \n\nAstrid's Journal is an illustrated audiobook series perfect for fans of Harriet the Spy, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Ender's Game. In combination with the Reader's Guide Exercises, it is a robust introduction for students (grades 3-8) to the powerful techniques of journaling. \n\nKeeping a journal is one of the most appealing tools for developing writing skills. Journaling is also beneficial for emotional development, helping kids better understand the events in their lives, recognizing their responses, and how to deal with them constructively. \n\n\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude40 \ud835\ude41\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d \ud835\ude44\ud835\ude49\ud835\ude4e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude50\ud835\ude3e\ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude4a\ud835\ude4d\ud835\ude4e\nThe focus of each episode of Astrid's Journal is to help students build strong foundational skills, meeting the Reading Standards for the Common Core for English Language Arts (Literature and Writing) for grades 3-5.
