      "description": "\ud83d\udcd9 Get your copy of _Christianity for Skeptics_ (recommended at the end) here: https://creation.com/36cfs\n\n---\n\nMany commonly held views about the church\u2019s role in history are based on myths, exaggerations, or falsehoods. Topics such as the church teaching a flat earth, Galileo\u2019s dispute with the church, Hypatia\u2019s murder, the \u2018Dark Ages\u2019, and the church\u2019s stance on anesthesia have been misrepresented over time. For example, most scholars throughout church history knew the earth was round, Galileo\u2019s conflict was as much about politics as science, Hypatia had Christian students and admirers, no historian uses the term \u2018Dark Ages\u2019 because the Middle Ages were a period of great innovation, and no Christian of note opposed anesthesia.\n\nLater in the conversation, Dr Jonathan Sarfati explores deeper issues. For example, is religion is the cause of wars, the Crusades, and Inquisition. In reality, atheistic regimes of the 20th century caused far more deaths than religious conflicts, e.g. Stalin\u2019s Holodomor, Mao\u2019s Great Leap Forward, and Pol Pot\u2019s killing fields. He highlights that Christianity has been responsible for significant moral progress, such as the abolition of slavery, driven by the belief that all people are made in God\u2019s Image.\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Introduction\n01:29 Did the Church teach that Earth is flat?\n04:50 The Galileo caricature\n07:45 Did Christians oppose anesthesia?\n10:20 Hasn\u2019t Christianity caused many wars?\n12:04 Isn\u2019t the Church responsible for the Crusades?\n13:40 Is the Church responsible for the Dark Ages?\n16:55 Was Hypatia murdered by Christians?\n20:41 Was the Inquisition the Church\u2019s darkest hour?\n23:23 Christian regimes versus atheistic ones\n25:15 Did the Church spread slavery?\n28:15 \u2192 The end of Islamic slavery\n29:09 \u2192 The end of American slavery\n30:44 \u2192 Doesn\u2019t the Old Testament condone slavery?\n33:04 Was Adolf Hitler a Christian?\n35:23 Are you saying Christians haven\u2019t done _any_ bad things?\n37:50 What _good_ things has Christianity done for the world?\n40:28 \u2192 Education and classical education\n41:51 \u2192 Inventions Christianity was responsible for\n44:04 Why does Christianity even exist?\n45:51 Book recommendation: _Christianity for Skeptics_\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 What good is Christianity? https://creation.com/what-good-is-christianity\n\u2022 Medieval misconceptions https://creation.com/medieval-misconceptions\n\u2022 The flat earth myth https://creation.com/flat-earth-myth\n\u2022 Did Christians oppose James Simpson on childbirth pain relief? https://creation.com/simpson-childbirth-anesthesia\n\u2022 Anti-slavery activist William Wilberforce: Christian hero https://creation.com/wilberforce\n\u2022 What about bad things done by the Church? https://creation.com/bad-things-by-church\n\u2022 Galileo Quadricentennial https://creation.com/the-galileo-affair-refuting-the-falsehoods\n\u2022 Refutation of New Scientist\u2019s Evolution: 24 myths and misconceptions https://creation.com/new-scientist-rebuttal-demonstrating-the-nazi-dependance-on-darwinism\n\u2022 Atheists credit the Gospel https://creation.com/atheists-credit-christianity\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 The Air We Breathe https://creation.com/s/10-2-682\n\u2022 Christianity for Skeptics https://creation.com/s/10-2-585\n\u2022 Refuting the New Atheists https://creation.com/s/30-9-663\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events around the world each year.

      "description": "\ud83d\udcd6 To subscribe to _Creation_ magazine (mentioned at the end of the video) visit: https://creation.com/37cm\n\n---\n\nExploring the tension between biblical and secular history, this discussion delves into complex questions\u2014Is the Earth thousands or billions of years old? What do genealogies reveal about the Bible\u2019s timeline, and how do we reconcile this with the dates proposed by modern science? The conversation also touches on ancient Egyptian history, carbon dating, and why these topics shape our understanding of humanity\u2019s origins and our place in history. \n\nBeyond these scientific and historical analyses lies a more profound question: why does any of it matter? With insights drawn from Scripture, the discussion unveils how beliefs about creation and the Fall directly influence the purpose and message of redemption. These foundational elements connect directly to the role of Jesus, the \u201clast Adam,\u201d who reconciles creation to God. Dr. Rob Carter weaves together science, theology, and personal experience, illustrating how a firm biblical foundation can transform both understanding and faith.\n\n\u23f3 TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Introduction\n01:09 What is the Bible\u2019s view on the earth\u2019s age?\n01:54 How can we build a biblical timeline?\n03:29 Why are genealogies important?\n04:16 How does Egypt\u2019s timeline impact chronology?\n07:44 Do any external points confirm Bible history?\n10:29 Why trust the Bible\u2019s account of history?\n12:50 What chronologies span the entire Bible?\n14:28 How did Methuselah live so long?\n18:55 Do humans desire to live forever?\n20:53 Are there gaps in biblical genealogies?\n23:15 How do pyramids fit biblical history?\n27:16 How does carbon dating work?\n29:38 Why does Earth\u2019s age matter?\n32:00 How did Dr Carter find biblical answers?\n34:14 Creation Magazine\n36:27 Wrap-up\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 Why Bible History Matters https://creation.com/bible-history-fall-ark\n\u2022 Who is wrong about the biblical date of the Flood, and the Great Pyramid? https://creation.com/pyramid-date-wrong\n\u2022 Egyptian chronology and the Bible \u2013 framing the issues https://creation.com/egypt-chronology\n\u2022 Perspectives on ancient chronology and the Old Testament\u2014part 1 https://creation.com/ot-ancient-chronology-1\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 Creation Magazine \u2013 https://creation.com/magazine\n\u2022 Timeline of World History poster \u2013 https://creation.com/s/25-2-515\n\u2022 15 Reasons to Take Genesis as History (booklet) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/00-1-536\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events around the world each year.

Is it right to alter DNA to repair defects or improve crops? What about using genetic modifications to regrow human limbs? These advancements come with the potential for unintended consequences, requiring wisdom and moral clarity. How can Christians discern boundaries in a world where technology\u2019s reach seems limitless?\n\nDr Rob Carter examines genetic engineering through three guiding principles: respecting humans as bearers of God\u2019s image, stewarding creation responsibly, and following Christ\u2019s example of healing and restoration. He explores applications ranging from medical breakthroughs to ethical dilemmas in IVF and cloning.

The most central of these is the belief that everything can (and must) be explained _without reference to God._ But is that assumption _reasonable?_ How well does it fit with the observations?\n\nThe truth is that the physical evidence we observe in our solar system contradicts the evolutionary story\u2014on _many_ counts.\n\nJoin Dr Mark Harwood\u2014who played a key role in the development of Australia\u2019s national satellite system\u2014for a fascinating and enlightening look at just _some_ of the evidence that points to a young age for our solar system.

Jeff Benjamin delves into the challenges of reconciliation, emphasizing that avoiding conflict only builds tension over time. Instead, he advocates for facing issues head-on through forgiveness, even before receiving an apology, as a way to foster healthier relationships. \n\nForgiveness, Jeff explains, isn\u2019t only for others; it frees us from bitterness and allows for peace. He shares how this principle aligns with biblical teachings and offers practical applications for workplace and personal relationships, encouraging listeners to rethink how they handle offenses, big and small.    \n\n\u23f3 TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:37 Introduction\n01:02 Why discuss forgiveness at all?\n02:18 Managing versus resolving conflict\n03:08 Big and small conflicts?\n04:11 Why is fixing conflict so hard?\n09:56 Are apologies only for big issues?\n11:41 Does forgiveness fix everything?\n13:51 Is reconciliation always worth it?\n17:44 A biblical theme in the workplace\n18:52 Should we forgive before an apology?\n20:46 Isn\u2019t forgiving first unfair?\n22:41 Is withholding forgiveness sinful?\n24:05 Consequences for not forgiving\n26:42 Reconciliation theme of the Bible\n27:33 Then does everyone go to heaven?\n28:23 How this connects to Genesis\n29:35 From Creation to Salvation (book) \n30:09 Wrap-up\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 Dawkins\u2019 dilemma: how God forgives sin https://creation.com/dawkins-dilemma \n\u2022 Is God unjust for sending people to Hell? https://creation.com/hell-unfair   \n\u2022 About \u2018Creation to Salvation\u2019 (book) https://creation.com/from-creation-to-salvation     \n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 Creation to Salvation (book) https://creation.com/s/10-2-653   \n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events around the world each year.

Chapter 16 deals with ice ages, and chapter 4 deals with dating methods.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard of ice core dating, chances are you imagine some sort of precise, scientific dating method involving counting layers in ice samples\u2014kind of like counting tree rings in trees. And you\u2019d be _partly_ right.\n\nBut is ice core dating reliable? How does it work, anyway? Is it an _objective_ dating method, or does it rely on assumptions? If assumptions are involved, does everybody _agree_ on those assumptions?

Dive into the details of Jericho, Ai, and Hazor, examining the ruins, burn layers, and cultural artifacts.\n\nKeaton Halley discusses how assumptions, biases, and academic trends influence interpretations of the evidence.

While most can be explained naturally, there are many that defy the laws of physics and challenge natural explanations\u2014leading to deeper questions about their nature and origin.\n\nCould they be extraterrestrial? Or do they point to an interdimensional, or even _spiritual_ reality?\n\nWhat have government investigations concluded? Have they been hiding information from the public\u2014and if so, why? (Could it be that they have been hiding just how _little_ they know, rather than how _much_ they know?)\n\nGary Bates, a leading Christian researcher, shows how historical records, government reports, and modern testimonies, all reveal a complex pattern of deception that mirrors biblical warnings about the spiritual realm. He explains how these entities have changed their appearance over time to fit with cultural and technological trends, and how invoking the name of Jesus halts so-called alien abductions! Drawing on decades of research, Gary provides meaningful answers that not only make sense of the evidence, but also align strikingly with the Bible.\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:58 Introduction and recap of previous \u2018alien\u2019 interview\n04:01 Why UFOs have been renamed to UAPs\n05:00 The modern UFO phenomenon\n08:46 An ancient phenomenon that \u2018shape-shifts\u2019 with time\n14:13 The 1952 Washington UFOs\n16:26 UFOs as a cover for Soviet weapons testing\n17:29 The official line, through multiple reports (1947\u201369): \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to see here\u201d\n21:18 The recent official flip: \u201cThere IS something to see here!\u201d\n26:18 Governments were covering up their ignorance, rather than their special knowledge\n27:13 Research points to \u2018paranormal, \u2018interdimensional\u2019, \u2018supernatural\u2019 phenomena (rather than advanced tech)\n35:56 Why is the government changing its tune and being more open now?\n41:54 The government\u2019s about-turn may pave the way for a huge increase in sightings/\u2018experiences\u2019\n46:22 Could UFOs be high-tech drones?\n48:29 The sinister nature of alien experiences\n49:05 Prediction: Preparing the way for a great deception?\n51:50 There is no space in the Bible (or the Gospel!) for sentient alien life\n01:01:09 Truth is the best defense against deception\n01:03:02 The Dominion Mandate\n01:05:13 The Anthropic Principle\n01:08:34 Free award-winning documentary: Alien Intrusion: Unmasking a Deception\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 Are aliens actually demons? \u2013 https://youtu.be/6QovsfJikwA\n\u2022 The government reports on UFOs \u2013 https://youtu.be/-7MEzJF2s-k\n\u2022 Prepare ye the way\u2014The aliens are coming! \u2013 https://creation.com/aliens-are-coming\n\u2022 Official investigations into UFOs/aliens \u2013 https://creation.com/aliens-are-coming-part-2\n\u2022 US government spends millions researching UFOs \u2013 https://creation.com/us-government-ufos\n\u2022 What really happened at Roswell? \u2013 https://creation.com/what-really-happened-at-roswell\n\u2022 Did God create life on other planets? \u2013 https://creation.com/did-god-create-life-on-other-planets\n\u2022 UFOs and aliens: What\u2019s it all about \u2013 https://creation.com/ufos-and-aliens\n\u2022 UFOs and the bible \u2013 https://creation.com/ufos-and-the-bible\n\u2022 The UFO phenomenon: Should we take it seriously? \u2013 https://creation.com/the-ufo-phenomenon\n\u2022 Are UFOs real? \u2013 https://creation.com/are-ufos-real\n\u2022 Has Earth been visited by ETs? https://creation.com/cab-9\n\u2022 Alien Life / UFO Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/alien-life-ufo-questions-and-answers\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 Alien Intrusion: UFOs and the evolution connection (book, eBook, audio) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-566\n\u2022 Alien Intrusion: Unmasking a deception (streaming, DVD, Blu-ray) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/35-8-567\n\u2022 Alien Abductions and UFOs - Exposed!

      "description": "Can Christians reconcile millions of years with the Bible? While some argue God could have used such vast periods to create, this idea raises theological challenges. Death and suffering in the fossil record contradict the Bible\u2019s teaching of a perfect creation before the Fall. The question becomes one of authority: do we trust Scripture\u2019s clear account, or reinterpret it to fit modern scientific claims?\n\nThe origins of the millions-of-years concept trace back to early geology, but Scott Gillis highlights how this view undermines foundational doctrines like the Gospel and the justice of God. By standing on the authority of Scripture, he shows how the evidence\u2014biological complexity and the global flood\u2014supports the Bible\u2019s account of creation, affirming a miraculous and trustworthy Creator.\n\n\ud83d\udcd8 Get a FREE copy of _Refuting Compromise_ here: https://creation.com/56rc\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 To subscribe to _Creation_ magazine (mentioned at the end of the video) visit: https://creation.com/56cm\n\n---\n\n\u23f3 TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:44 Introduction \n01:01 Rejecting millions of years in creation\n01:59 The importance of Earth\u2019s age \n03:10 Undermining Scripture with millions of years\n03:34 Origin of millions and billions of years\n05:56 How and when God created the earth\n08:22 Time span from Adam to Jesus \n10:32 Theological problems with death before Adam\n13:46 Impact of millions of years on evangelism\n15:10 Determining the earth\u2019s age biblically\n16:32 Does maturity suggest an old Earth?\n18:49 Recommended: Refuting Compromise (book)\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 Did God create over billions of year? https://creation.com/did-god-create-over-billions-of-years\n\u2022 Why the earth can\u2019t be old! \u2013 https://youtu.be/zSGGnx2dT3k\n\u2022 How does the Bible teach 6000 years?  https://creation.com/6000-years \n\u2022 Does Genesis have a gap? https://creation.com/from-the-beginning-of-the-creation \n\u2022 How old is the earth, really? \u2013 https://youtu.be/P5eqIgbDRdc\n\u2022 History and pseudo-history https://creation.com/history-and-pseudo-history \n\u2022 What about the Framework Hypothesis? https://creation.com/is-genesis-poetry-figurative-a-theological-argument-polemic-and-thus-not-history \n\u2022 4 evidences for a young Earth \u2013 https://youtu.be/y23ap4bKSi0\n\u2022 Earth can\u2019t be old \u2014 Answering the critics \u2013 https://youtu.be/PFUxKgPbeDw\n\u2022 Did God use the \u201cBig Bang\u201d?https://creation.com/did-god-use-big-bang  \n\u2022 Why the creation-evolution issue is so important \u2013 https://youtu.be/4EgotQ5JbT4\n\u2022 Can Christians believe in evolution? \u2013 https://youtu.be/ZNmtdQPJv8I\n\u2022 Science, the Bible, and the age of the earth \u2013 https://youtu.be/LuP5GZ1iY4c\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 The Genesis Account (hardback) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-606\n\u2022 From Creation to Salvation (paperback) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-653\n\u2022 The Genesis Academy (streaming) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/35-8-697\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X(Twitter) https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events https://creation.com/events  around the world each year.

There are several chapters dealing with Noah\u2019s Ark and the Flood.\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Book a creation speaker at _your_ gathering: https://creation.com/events/book\n\n---\n\nThese days, the story of Noah and the Ark is often depicted as a quaint children\u2019s tale. Yet for millennia people considered it to be genuine history\u2014a true account of the most catastrophic event the world has ever known.\n\nWhat if they\u2019re right? Is the biblical account even feasible? Were ancient people capable of building a vessel of that size\u2014and if so, would it have even been seaworthy? Could the necessary animals, food, and water have fitted on board? How could they have repopulated the earth afterward? And critically, what about the physical evidence a global Flood would have left behind?\n\nRod Walsh has spent decades defending the biblical Flood account\u2014and has even built several incredible scale models of the Ark. Join him for an illuminating discussion of the feasibility of\u2014and evidence for\u2014the biblical account of Noah\u2019s Flood.\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:39 Introduction: Meet the \u2018Ark man\u2019, Rod Walsh\n03:54 Q1: Why did God send a global flood?\n05:34 Q2: Did Noah have the technology to build a massive ship?\n10:51 Q3: How big was the Ark?\n12:49 Q4: Was the Ark stable/seaworthy?\n15:06 Q5: How did Noah cut the wood to build the Ark?\n16:19 Q6: How did Noah steer the Ark?\n17:27 Q7: What was the carrying capacity of the Ark?\n18:33 Q8: How many animals went on the Ark?\n22:11 Q9: How did Noah deal with all the animal mess?\n23:12 Q10: How did Noah collect all the animals?\n23:36 Q11: What was the effect of the Flood on the earth?\n26:00 Q12: Why is there virtually no erosion between geologic layers said to be separated by millions of years, given rapid erosion rates today?\n30:33 Q13 & 14: How does the Grand Canyon point to Noah\u2019s Flood?

      "description": "Genesis is often debated: is it history, poetry, or myth? Why does it matter if it\u2019s taken as literal history? Explore how Genesis lays the foundation for biblical doctrines and explains the origin of death and suffering. Can a worldview without Genesis uphold moral absolutes, or does it shift the basis for truth entirely?\n\nDr Jonathan Sarfati unpacks the textual and theological reasons Genesis should be read as history. Discover the literary structure, the connection to the gospel, and how New Testament writers and Jesus Himself affirmed Genesis as real events. Dr Sarfati reveals why compromising on Genesis impacts not just theology but the essence of the gospel itself.\n\n\ud83d\udcd7 Get 25% OFF _The Genesis Account_ using the discount code SMVP57TGA.

Is it as firmly rooted in the scientific method as people have been led to believe? And is it actually _correct?_\n\nJoin geologist Dr Tas Walker for an insightful discussion of the history of the age of the earth.

      "description": "Can the Bible be trusted when it describes the natural world? Some claim it reflects primitive cosmology, portraying a solid dome sky with stars embedded within it and waters above. If true, this would challenge the Bible\u2019s reliability. But what do the Bible\u2019s own words reveal?\n\nExplore how terms like \u201cfirmament\u201d and descriptions of heavenly waters are understood in their original context. Is the Bible mistaken about science, or does it use poetic and observational language common in human expression? Keaton Halley delves into these questions, addressing claims about solid skies, heavenly oceans, and the movement of stars.\n\nBy examining ancient Near Eastern texts and biblical language, Halley demonstrates why Scripture\u2019s authority remains intact. He highlights the significance of interpreting the Bible within its context and trusting its claims about both the natural and spiritual realms.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 To subscribe to _Creation_ magazine (mentioned at the end of the video) visit: https://creation.com/58cm\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Book a creation speaker at your gathering: https://creation.com/events/book\n\n\u23f3 TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:51 Introduction\n01:08 Does the Bible gets science issues wrong?\n04:16 Are critics primarily the ones making these claims?\n06:11 Christians who think the Bible has errors: How do they reconcile this with their Faith?\n11:22 Promo: Creation Magazine\n11:49 Did the ancients believe in a solid sky?\n15:02 Does \u2018firmament\u2019 in Genesis 1 refer to a solid sky?\n19:24 Why \u2018raqiya\u2019 means \u2018expanse\u2019, not \u2018solid dome\u2019\n22:29 Does \u2018raqiya\u2019 show up elsewhere in the Bible?\n25:41 Does the Bible envision stars set in a solid dome?\n29:54 Promo: Have a Creation presentation at YOUR church\n30:37 What are the \u2018waters above\u2019 in Genesis 1?\n36:12 Psalm 29:10 \u2013 A \u2018heavenly sea\u2019?\n41:29 Psalm 104:3 \u2013 God \u2018lays the beams of His chambers on the waters\u2019?\n44:35 Genesis 7:11 \u2013 The \u2018windows of heaven\u2019?\n47:19 Conclusion: The Bible is trustworthy; it does not contain errors!\n48:36 Recommended: Creation Magazine\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 Biblical Heavens and the Language of Appearance \u2013 https://creation.com/heavens-phenomenological\n\u2022 The \u2018Waters Above\u2019: Competing Interpretations \u2013 https://creation.com/waters-above-survey\n\u2022 Is the Raq\u00eea\u2018 (\u2018Firmament\u2019) a Solid Dome? \u2013 https://creation.com/is-the-raqiya-firmament-a-solid-dome\n\u2022 The \u2018Windows of Heaven\u2019 Are Figurative \u2013 https://creation.com/windows-of-heaven\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 The Genesis Academy (video series) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/30-9-677\n\u2022 The Genesis Account (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-606\n\u2022 Christianity for Skeptics (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-585\n\u2022 Defending Genesis (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-400\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events around the world each year.

If molecular machines didn\u2019t exist, life wouldn\u2019t exist.\n\nSo, given that evolution is widely taught as \u2018fact\u2019, presumably the origin of these nanomachines can be explained in terms of step-by-step evolutionary processes\u2014right?\n\nNot at all!

And that\u2019s not a religious conclusion\u2014it\u2019s simply what the evidence indicates!\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfac Get FREE access to the award-winning documentary _Evolution\u2019s Achilles\u2019 Heels_ here: https://creation.com/70eah\n\n\ud83d\udcd6 To subscribe to _Creation_ magazine visit: https://creation.com/70cm\n\n\ud83d\udcfd ANIMATIONS\n\u2022 ATP synthase \u2013 https://youtu.be/W3KxU63gcF4\n\u2022 Bacterial flagellum \u2013 https://youtu.be/MNR48hUd-Hw?t=34\n\u2022 Kinesin linear motor \u2013 https://youtu.be/kOeJwQ0OXc4 and https://youtu.be/gbycQf1TbM0\n\u2022 Topoisomerase \u2013 https://youtu.be/wQ5oPL0PqYE\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser \n00:48 Introduction: What are nanobots, and are they essential to life?\n01:46 *ATP Synthase:* Synthesizing the energy currency of life!\n03:02 \u2192 How can we study it if it is too small to see through a microscope?\n04:45 \u2192 Function and structure of ATP synthase\n09:26 \u2192 How could ATP synthase have evolved?\n14:36 *Bacterial Flagella:* Like tiny outboard motors!\n15:40 \u2192 Where does the proton current that drives this \u2018motor\u2019 come from?\n16:17 \u2192 Composition and function of the bacterial flagellum\n20:01 \u2192 Precision and design in the bacterial flagellum\n23:03 \u2192 How could bacterial flagella have evolved?\n26:28 Aren\u2019t creationists just using \u2018god of the gaps\u2019 to explain these nanomotors?\n27:55 *Kinesin:* Amazing linear motors! \n28:38 \u2192 The function of kinesin motors\n31:48 \u2192 How fast do kinesins move?\n35:01 \u2192 More purposes of kinesin linear motors\n36:36 \u2192 How could kinesins have evolved?\n40:46 *Topoisomerase:* DNA detanglers!\n44:03 How could life have started without all of these nanobots already in existence?\n45:03 Why scientists reject intelligent design\n47:19 Conclusion: Life\u2019s nanobots point to design \u2026 _and purpose_\n48:33 Where to find out more\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 ATP synthase: Majestic molecular machine made by a mastermind \u2013 https://creation.com/atp-synthase\n\u2022 Design in living organisms (motors: ATP synthase) \u2013 https://creation.com/motor\n\u2022 Is ATP synthase found in _all_ life? \u2013 https://creation.com/atp-synthase-in-all-life\n\u2022 E. coli\u2019s electric motor: A marvel of design \u2013 https://creation.com/e-coli-motor\n\u2022 The design of bacterial flagella: part 1\u2014flagellar design in model organisms \u2013 https://creation.com/design-of-bacterial-flagella-1\n\u2022 Germ\u2019s miniature motor has a clutch \u2013 https://creation.com/germs-miniature-motor-has-a-clutch\n\u2022 Germ with seven motors in one! \u2013 https://creation.com/germ-7-motors-in-1\n\u2022 Incredible Kinesin!

      "description": "The Grand Canyon often evokes a narrative of ancient history spanning millions of years, but is there an alternative explanation that aligns with the Bible\u2019s historical account? From sedimentary layers to fossil arrangements, what if the evidence pointed to a catastrophic worldwide flood instead of slow geological processes? Explore the connections between geological and biological evolution, questioning assumptions like radiometric dating and the implications of bent rock layers that seem to defy conventional explanations.\n\nScott Gillis invites us to reconsider widely accepted interpretations of Earth\u2019s history, proposing that the Grand Canyon is not a monument to time but a scar from God\u2019s judgment during Noah\u2019s Flood. Unfold the evidence that he believes not only supports the Bible\u2019s truth but also challenges evolutionary timelines, pointing to a Creator who shaped, judged, and seeks to redeem the world.\n\n---\n\nCORRECTION: 18:16 \u2013 19:45 Polystrate fossils have been found in many places, but not in the Grand Canyon (to date).

      "description": "The Bible speaks of a New Heavens and Earth. But what will it be like? Will it be some sort of ethereal, spirit-like existence? Or will it be physical?\n\nAnd how do a person\u2019s beliefs about Genesis and origins\u2014for example, belief in evolution and long ages\u2014impact their beliefs about the coming New Creation?\n\nJoin Gary Bates for a fascinating\u2014and Gospel-centered\u2014discussion of the New Heavens and Earth. Gary compellingly argues that _physical resurrection_ is not only a basic Gospel truth, but that a _physical New Creation_ is the only kind that could suitably restore what was physically lost in the original Creation due to the Fall. He also shows how belief in millions of years of evolution, death, and suffering before Adam sinned is both unnecessary, and ultimately _incompatible_ with the Bible\u2019s big picture of Creation \u2192 Fall \u2192 Restoration.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfac Get FREE access to _Creation Restored_ here: https://creation.com/71cr\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Book a creation speaker at _your_ gathering: https://creation.com/events/book\n\n---\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:43 Introduction: Will the New Heavens and Earth be spiritual, or physical?\n01:34 Why a _physical_ New Heavens and Earth is a basic Gospel truth\n04:33 What does the Bible tell us about the New Heavens and Earth?

      "description": "Many Christians find themselves unsure how to respond when confronted with common atheist arguments. In this episode, apologist Keaton Halley addresses five frequently encountered challenges: Who created God? Aren\u2019t Christians atheists regarding other gods? Can God make a rock too heavy to lift? Would you believe differently if raised elsewhere? And is God just filling gaps in scientific knowledge?\n\nKeaton exposes the fundamental logical flaws in each argument while providing Christians with confident, reasoned responses. Drawing from his background in apologetics, he demonstrates how these challenges fail to undermine Christianity, and explains why evidence from science and philosophy actually points toward God\u2019s existence rather than away from it.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfac Get FREE access to _Refuting the New Atheists_ here: https://creation.com/60rna\n\n\ud83e\udd1d To support _Creation Talk_ and this ministry visit: https://creation.com/60donate\n\n---\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:49 Introduction: Five common atheist arguments\n03:32 Keaton\u2019s own faith journey\n05:11 Evidence for God\u2019s existence\n09:17 *Argument 1:* \u201cWho created God?\u201d\n14:07 *Argument 2:* \u201cChristians are atheists with respect to other gods!\u201d\n17:13 *Argument 3:* \u201cCan God make a rock too heavy for himself to lift?\u201d\n19:39 *Argument 4:* \u201cIf you were raised in a different religion, you\u2019d think THAT was right!\u201d\n24:20 *Argument 5:* \u201cBelief in God relies on ignorance; science has the answers!\u201d\n27:15 How to address OTHER arguments\n30:58 Where to get more information\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 No evidence for God? \u2013 https://creation.com/evidence-for-god\n\u2022 Philosophical arguments for God \u2013 https://creation.com/arguments-for-god\n\u2022 Does God Exist? \u2013 https://creation.com/does-god-exist\n\u2022 Who Created God? \u2013 https://creation.com/who-created-god\n\u2022 If God Created the Universe, Then Who Created God? \u2013 https://creation.com/whomadegod\n\u2022 Are Christians \u2018atheists\u2019 with respect to other religions? \u2013 https://creation.com/christians-atheists-other-religions\n\u2022 If God can do anything, then can He make a being more powerful than Himself? \u2013 https://creation.com/omnipotence\n\u2022 Questioning God\u2019s many attributes \u2013 https://creation.com/gods-omni-attributes\n\u2022 A designer isn\u2019t a \u2018God of the gaps\u2019 \u2013 https://youtu.be/DLYS41haWzM\n\u2022 The god-of-the-gaps charge doesn\u2019t stick \u2013 https://creation.com/god-of-gaps-charge\n\u2022 Science of the gaps \u2013 https://creation.com/science-of-the-gaps\n\u2022 God: Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/god\n\u2022 Christian Apologetics: Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/apologetics\n\u2022 Countering the Critics: Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/critics\n\u2022 Atheism \u2013 https://creation.com/atheism\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 Refuting the New Atheists (DVD) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/30-9-663\n\u2022 Christianity for Skeptics (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-585\n\u2022 Evolution's Achilles' Heels (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-640\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X / Twitter: https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter: https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events https://creation.com/events around the world each year.

      "description": "What does it mean to be a man? Society offers conflicting answers, from outdated stereotypes to extremes of dominance or passivity. But what does the Bible say? Masculinity is more than appearances or achievements\u2014it\u2019s about integrity, humility, and servant leadership. A real man leads with compassion, exercises self-control, and strives to reflect the character of God.\n\nScripture shows us flawed men\u2014David, Moses, Gideon\u2014who still pursued righteousness. It\u2019s a call to resilience, repentance, and faith.
