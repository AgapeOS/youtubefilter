      "description": "The Grand Canyon often evokes a narrative of ancient history spanning millions of years, but is there an alternative explanation that aligns with the Bible\u2019s historical account? From sedimentary layers to fossil arrangements, what if the evidence pointed to a catastrophic worldwide flood instead of slow geological processes? Explore the connections between geological and biological evolution, questioning assumptions like radiometric dating and the implications of bent rock layers that seem to defy conventional explanations.\n\nScott Gillis invites us to reconsider widely accepted interpretations of Earth\u2019s history, proposing that the Grand Canyon is not a monument to time but a scar from God\u2019s judgment during Noah\u2019s Flood. Unfold the evidence that he believes not only supports the Bible\u2019s truth but also challenges evolutionary timelines, pointing to a Creator who shaped, judged, and seeks to redeem the world.\n\n---\n\nCORRECTION: 18:16 \u2013 19:45 Polystrate fossils have been found in many places, but not in the Grand Canyon (to date).

      "description": "The Bible speaks of a New Heavens and Earth. But what will it be like? Will it be some sort of ethereal, spirit-like existence? Or will it be physical?\n\nAnd how do a person\u2019s beliefs about Genesis and origins\u2014for example, belief in evolution and long ages\u2014impact their beliefs about the coming New Creation?\n\nJoin Gary Bates for a fascinating\u2014and Gospel-centered\u2014discussion of the New Heavens and Earth. Gary compellingly argues that _physical resurrection_ is not only a basic Gospel truth, but that a _physical New Creation_ is the only kind that could suitably restore what was physically lost in the original Creation due to the Fall. He also shows how belief in millions of years of evolution, death, and suffering before Adam sinned is both unnecessary, and ultimately _incompatible_ with the Bible\u2019s big picture of Creation \u2192 Fall \u2192 Restoration.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfac Get FREE access to _Creation Restored_ here: https://creation.com/71cr\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Book a creation speaker at _your_ gathering: https://creation.com/events/book\n\n---\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:43 Introduction: Will the New Heavens and Earth be spiritual, or physical?\n01:34 Why a _physical_ New Heavens and Earth is a basic Gospel truth\n04:33 What does the Bible tell us about the New Heavens and Earth?

      "description": "Many Christians find themselves unsure how to respond when confronted with common atheist arguments. In this episode, apologist Keaton Halley addresses five frequently encountered challenges: Who created God? Aren\u2019t Christians atheists regarding other gods? Can God make a rock too heavy to lift? Would you believe differently if raised elsewhere? And is God just filling gaps in scientific knowledge?\n\nKeaton exposes the fundamental logical flaws in each argument while providing Christians with confident, reasoned responses. Drawing from his background in apologetics, he demonstrates how these challenges fail to undermine Christianity, and explains why evidence from science and philosophy actually points toward God\u2019s existence rather than away from it.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfac Get FREE access to _Refuting the New Atheists_ here: https://creation.com/60rna\n\n\ud83e\udd1d To support _Creation Talk_ and this ministry visit: https://creation.com/60donate\n\n---\n\n\u23f3 CHAPTERS\n00:00 Teaser\n00:49 Introduction: Five common atheist arguments\n03:32 Keaton\u2019s own faith journey\n05:11 Evidence for God\u2019s existence\n09:17 *Argument 1:* \u201cWho created God?\u201d\n14:07 *Argument 2:* \u201cChristians are atheists with respect to other gods!\u201d\n17:13 *Argument 3:* \u201cCan God make a rock too heavy for himself to lift?\u201d\n19:39 *Argument 4:* \u201cIf you were raised in a different religion, you\u2019d think THAT was right!\u201d\n24:20 *Argument 5:* \u201cBelief in God relies on ignorance; science has the answers!\u201d\n27:15 How to address OTHER arguments\n30:58 Where to get more information\n\n\u270d\ufe0f LINKS AND SHOW NOTES\n\u2022 No evidence for God? \u2013 https://creation.com/evidence-for-god\n\u2022 Philosophical arguments for God \u2013 https://creation.com/arguments-for-god\n\u2022 Does God Exist? \u2013 https://creation.com/does-god-exist\n\u2022 Who Created God? \u2013 https://creation.com/who-created-god\n\u2022 If God Created the Universe, Then Who Created God? \u2013 https://creation.com/whomadegod\n\u2022 Are Christians \u2018atheists\u2019 with respect to other religions? \u2013 https://creation.com/christians-atheists-other-religions\n\u2022 If God can do anything, then can He make a being more powerful than Himself? \u2013 https://creation.com/omnipotence\n\u2022 Questioning God\u2019s many attributes \u2013 https://creation.com/gods-omni-attributes\n\u2022 A designer isn\u2019t a \u2018God of the gaps\u2019 \u2013 https://youtu.be/DLYS41haWzM\n\u2022 The god-of-the-gaps charge doesn\u2019t stick \u2013 https://creation.com/god-of-gaps-charge\n\u2022 Science of the gaps \u2013 https://creation.com/science-of-the-gaps\n\u2022 God: Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/god\n\u2022 Christian Apologetics: Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/apologetics\n\u2022 Countering the Critics: Questions and Answers \u2013 https://creation.com/critics\n\u2022 Atheism \u2013 https://creation.com/atheism\n\n\ud83d\udcda HELPFUL RESOURCES\n\u2022 Refuting the New Atheists (DVD) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/30-9-663\n\u2022 Christianity for Skeptics (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-585\n\u2022 Evolution's Achilles' Heels (book) \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-640\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X / Twitter: https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter: https://creation.com/infobytes\n\n\ud83d\udcc5 EVENTS\nWe present at hundreds of events https://creation.com/events around the world each year.

      "description": "For many Christians, the idea of talking to other people about our faith is very daunting.\n\nOne reason for this is that we tend to have quite unrealistic\u2014and imposing\u2014mental pictures of what \u201cwitnessing\u201d conversations should look like. But it doesn\u2019t have to be that hard!\n\nSo, how do we get past our own unhelpful stereotypes of evangelism, to being able to have simple, unforced conversations about spiritual things\u2014when the opportunity arises? (And opportunities arise more frequently than most people realize!)\n\nDr Tas Walker has been sharing his faith for decades, and in this episode, he shares a number of very practical tips and examples to help you share your faith too!\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udf81 Get FREE unlimited streaming access to our digital resource _Creation Evangelism in a Secular World_ when you subscribe to _Creation_ magazine using the discount code SMVP72CM.

      "description": "What does it mean to be a man? Society offers conflicting answers, from outdated stereotypes to extremes of dominance or passivity. But what does the Bible say? Masculinity is more than appearances or achievements\u2014it\u2019s about integrity, humility, and servant leadership. A real man leads with compassion, exercises self-control, and strives to reflect the character of God.\n\nScripture shows us flawed men\u2014David, Moses, Gideon\u2014who still pursued righteousness. It\u2019s a call to resilience, repentance, and faith. Jeff Benjamin shares how these timeless principles challenge and inspire men to live as God intended.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udce9 To subscribe to our email newsletter, _Creation INFObytes_ (mentioned at the end of the video), visit: https://creation.com/61infobytes\n\n\ud83c\udfa4 Book a creation speaker at _your_ gathering: https://creation.com/events/book\n\n---\n\n\u23f1\ufe0f TIMECODES  \n00:00 Teaser\n00:45 Introduction: What does it mean to be a man?\n02:11 Defining masculinity\n04:22 Traditional vs contemporary views\n11:12 Toxic masculinity\n14:39 Why does toxic masculinity gain an audience?\n15:41 A biblical view of manhood\n18:24 The traits of a biblical man\u2019s heart\n18:33 \u2192 Righteousness\n19:36 \u2192 Faith in God\n20:14 \u2192 Servant leadership\n22:21 \u2192 Humility\n24:45 \u2192 Compassion\n25:37 \u2192 Self-control (and emotion)\n29:34 The biblical duties of a man: Protect and provide\n31:10 The need for resilience\n33:21 More traits: Honesty, trustworthiness, and integrity\n34:09 Role models\n35:44 Which kind of man do you want to be?\n37:03 Creation.com\u2019s e-newsletter\n\n\ud83d\udcda RELATED RESOURCES\n\u2022 Affirming God\u2019s Image \u2013 https://creation.com/s/10-2-665\n\u2022 Gender Identity & Confusion \u2013 https://creation.com/s/35-8-708\n\u2022 The Genesis Academy \u2013 https://creation.com/s/30-9-677\n\n\ud83d\udd17 RELATED CONTENT\n\u2022 Are women made in God\u2019s image? \u2013 https://creation.com/women-in-gods-image\n\u2022 Did the Fall destroy God\u2019s image in man? \u2013 https://creation.com/fall-destroy-gods-image\n\u2022 Help Christians answer transgenderism \u2013 https://creation.com/affirming-gods-image-review\n\u2022 The Obscuring of God\u2019s Image Will Hurt Society \u2013 https://creation.com/in-his-image-review\n\u2022 The Bible\u2019s high view of women grounded in the creation account \u2013 https://creation.com/biblical-view-women\n\u2022 Made in the image of God \u2013 https://creation.com/made-in-the-image-of-god\n\u2022 Man: The image of God \u2013 https://creation.com/man-the-image-of-god\n\nFind many other interesting videos https://youtube.com/creationministriesinternational\n\n\ud83d\udc99 SOCIAL MEDIA\n\u25ba Facebook https://www.facebook.com/creationministries\n\u25ba TikTok https://www.tiktok.com/@creationministries\n\u25ba Instagram https://www.instagram.com/creationministries\n\u25ba X(Twitter) https://twitter.com/creationnews\n\u25ba eNewsletter https://creation.com/infobytes\n\nCheck out the article podcast https://creation.com/media-center/series/creation-talk   our other show wherever you get your podcasts.",
