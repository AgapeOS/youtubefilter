In this episode, Paul and Todd summarize the young age creationist view of Genesis 1 as the first week of time.

In this episode, they get down to really deep issues as they wrestle with the actual relationship of science and faith. How do believers go about reconciling what they see in science and in Scripture? Is there a right way? What do our anxieties have to do with this? Struggling through these issues lead the guys to chat about being creationists in a pluralistic church, where different people believe different things. If our most important goal is following Jesus, what does that look like when our personal beliefs are so very different from someone else's?

If the world we live in is the same way God made it in the beginning, what does this tell us about God's care for the animals? On the other hand, if God really does care for the animals, how might that care shape our view of creation? Dr. Wells walks us through scripture's teaching about animals and explains what we should do about it.
