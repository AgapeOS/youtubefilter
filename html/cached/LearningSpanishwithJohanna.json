      "description": "~Teaching new vocabulary\nNote: Dedicate at least two to three classes to each lesson. On day one, you can do steps 1 and 2, and on day two you can do step 3, etc. It will depend on your child\u2019s way of learning.\n\nChoose the lesson you want to teach (we will use Colors as an example) \n\nLEARN THE SONG AND MOTIONS \nGo to the icon \u201cSong Videos\u201d Have your student learn the song and motions by watching the song video titled Colors. \n     2.  REVIEW VOCABULARY\n\nGo to the icon \u201cSongs\u201d and click on the picture titled Colors. You will see the vocabulary and also the option of playing the song. Play the song and have your student sing it pointing to the colors, then have your student say the colors out loud (no singing this time). \n    3. LEARN NEW VOCABULARY \n\nGo to the icon \u201cLesson Videos\u201d have your child watch the video titled Colors. (Your child can watch it two times on different days to help reinforce vocabulary) \nPrint the vocabulary. Go to the icon \u201cVocabulary\u201d, click on the picture titled \u2018Colors\u2019 and click \u2018download PDF\u2019. You can use it to create note cards or keep them as a journal for you and your child. Since it has the words in it, it will also help when they work on the worksheet. \n    4. REINFORCE VOCABULARY \n\nOnce the child has learned the vocabulary it\u2019s time for the Worksheet. At the end of every lesson, we will do a worksheet. Depending on the lesson some worksheets will take more work than others but in essence, all of them will require your child to use them interactively! To do so, go to the icon \u201cWorksheet Games\u201d and follow the instructions of the page. \nYou have completed your lesson! Don\u2019t forget to go back to your worksheet binder at least once a month and practice the vocabulary! \n\n\n\n\nMade by Learning Spanish with Johanna\r\nCheck out our website www.learningspanishwithjohanna.com",
