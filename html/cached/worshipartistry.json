Do I have everything I need before rehearsals? Did I bring everything I need so I\u2019m not asking the leader for them? Teamwork makes the dream work\u2013shocker!\n\nI also realized you worry less about how the service is going and get to engage with the team.\n\nWhat are some ways you could be more helpful to your team?\n\n#worshipleaderstilllearning\n#worshipleader\n#whatcomfalls\n#eastersunday\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel: https://bit.ly/2PIlqWw\u200b \n\nAbout Worship Artistry:\nWorship Artistry helps you bring your best in worship, whatever your skill level.

      "description": "In this video, Nick and Jason get together and created an instrumental version of, Because Of Christ by The Belonging Co.\n\nWhy are we doing this?  There are many different ways to utilize an instrumental such as this, but a few ways to do so would be; during a prayer time, or the prayer right before the last song leading into the full version of Because Of Christ (If you have a prayer before the last song), communion would be a great opportunity to play an instrumental like this too.  It also could be fun to play when people are walking into wherever you worship. What we are really wanting is to try and inspire you to not feel like you can't be creative with your team, or feel like you only have to play it like the record always.  We think you and your church will be throughly pleased, maybe surprised, with what the worship team can pull together. Try and have some fun with it!  Let us know how you would use an instrumental during service.\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Salutations\n0:12 Why do this?\n1:28 Because Of Christ Instrumental\n\nView the full tutorial - https://worshipartistry.com/songs/the-belonging-co/ten/because-of-christ\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel: https://bit.ly/2PIlqWw\u200b \n\nAbout Worship Artistry:\nWorship Artistry helps you bring your best in worship, whatever your skill level.

      "description": "So you recently started playing rhythm electric guitar, maybe you just came from acoustic?  We think these chords are an absolute must in not only expanding your knowledge and giving you more tools, but for the dynamics of a song too.  Playing cowboy chords is fine and does sound fantastic, but typically that's what the acoustic is playing and often times it's nice to not play the same things and have different voicings.  There is a time and place in a song to play the exact same voicings, but not the whole song.

These ideas apply to almost any digital platform and/or amp and pedals it may just be called something a little different, but everything does the same type of things. It's really the thoughts of the madman, Nick, you're after here.\n\nNick dials in a stereo preset with the wet fx after the amps.  He does prefer to have the wet fx in front of his real amps though.

Showcasing a few tips he learned along the way and hopefully making it easy to understand.  A lot of what guitar and music really is, is a bunch of repeating things.  The fretboard is the exact same.\n\nNick shows 2 different octave shapes that helped him visualize and unlock the fretboard.  These two shapes are often found in worship music and served as a great introduction to how Nick learned lead guitar, but they are still very much EG2 friendly. \n\nCHECK OUT OUR VIDEO ON INVERSIONS HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/TTczaQQLrr8?si=UT_I1_O5LjhBZu93\n\n\nCHECK OUT OUR VIDEO ON POWER OCTAVES/TRIADS HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/xUEbioMG5X0?si=Ck4Z1YOb1HrG9zaV\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Welcome\n0:28 Tips to unlock the fretboard\n0:42 7 Notes\n1:15 Know your open string notes\n1:40 Low E string natural notes\n1:57 Sharps/Flats\n2:46 Low E notes\n3:48 A String notes\n4:57 Sound Sample - First Octave Shape\n5:23 How to find the octaves\n6:15 You now know the D string notes\n6:50 Octaves using the A string as a root\n7:15 Octave shapes for Low E and A strings\n8:02 Make sure to mute\n8:18 Sound Sample - Second Octave Shape\n8:45 Second octave shape\n10:05 You now know all the notes of the fretboard because of octaves\n12:10 Practice is a MUST\n12:50 Thank you\n13:31 Subscribe\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel: https://bit.ly/2PIlqWw\u200b \n\nAbout Worship Artistry:\nWorship Artistry helps you bring your best in worship, whatever your skill level.

We will be going over 2 different ways to play this chord progression.\n\nOne way will demonstrate staying in a very tight spot on the fretboard and the other will be a bit all over the place.  Which way is better? There's really no way to answer that but to only say; whatever the song needs.  Whatever band members you have during a giving set will also dictate which type you play.  These triad types are referred to as \"open-voiced triads\" and \"close-voiced triads\".  We are only going over 2 different types but with these two types you can find your place in the mix very easily.\n\nCHECK OUT OUR VIDEO ON INVERSIONS HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/TTczaQQLrr8?si=UT_I1_O5LjhBZu93\n\nCHECK OUT OUR VIDEO ON POWER OCTAVES/TRIADS HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/xUEbioMG5X0?si=Ck4Z1YOb1HrG9zaV\n\nCHECK OUT OUR VIDEO ON OCTAVE MAPPING HERE:\nhttps://youtu.be/XDt71FtwUKg?si=Hux1Utw7DulrGxrP\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Welcome\n0:30 Chord Progression\n0:51 Typical Boring Chords - Band Context\n1:17 Stick Out In The Mix\n1:44 Open-Voiced Triads - Band Context\n2:52 G, B, and E Strings\n3:03 1 Chord (D)\n3:27 5 Chord (A)\n5:26 6 Chord (Bm)\n5:37 4 Chord (G)\n6:04 Playing Through The Progression\n6:25 Mute Strings\n6:59 Close-Voiced Triads - Band Context\n8:19 You Need Confidence\n8:45 Try Something Different\n10:08 Chord Progression Play Through\n10:38 Turning On FX\n12:54 You Can Play These In Any Key Now\n13:44 Always Communicate\n14:14 Too Much Verb??\n14:48 Subscribe\n\n\nAbout Worship Artistry:\nWorship Artistry helps you bring your best in worship, whatever your skill level.

      "description": "Do you learn AND practice? Is there a difference?\n\nI think that there is a difference and it took me a very long time to figure that out. I couldn\u2019t remember anything but I practiced for a long time. I didn\u2019t really understand that I wasn\u2019t learning what was in front of me. I learned to play along with the song and I didn\u2019t learn the actual song.\n\nOnce I recognized that and I started to go a bit slower in the learning process and then actually practicing, it got so much easier to remember everything for the service. And I ultimately got sooo much better at music.\n\nAnd often times when I did come up against something that was harder, I\u2019d just figure a different way to play something similar vs taking the time to learn the part.\n\nLearning can be difficult, it takes time to master what you\u2019re trying to learn, so practice as often as you can and I bet you\u2019ll be able to learn to play what you want.\n\nThere is time and commitment involved, it isn\u2019t an easy thing sometimes.\n\nWhat have you been learning and practicing?",

It's no fun and it can be very discouraging at times.  Well, that's where Nick was, Jason noticed and came to the rescue.  Just by shifting things around, that Nick already knew, Jason was able to help him think a little different and start to string together some licks that he probably wouldn't have thought of before.

      "description": "This is not a head to head comparison of the two modelers. This is a real world \"we only need a few things to get by\" comparison.  Jason recently traveled with his Hotone Ampero and really loved using it.  So we figured we'd try to get a close enough sound out of the Quad Cortex and see if you really do need to spend the big bucks on that or go the more inexpensive route with the Ampero.  We thought they both sounded great and honestly if you don't need all the flexibility that the QC offers, we would say save some money and get the Ampero.  It is much more limited in what it can do, but as you hear in this video, it really keeps up.  So do you want to save some money? or no? Nick didn't, he loves having the flexibility and all the DSP power, but that's up to you.\n\nSUBSCRIBE to our channel: https://bit.ly/2PIlqWw\u200b \n\nAbout Worship Artistry:\nWorship Artistry helps you bring your best in worship, whatever your skill level.
