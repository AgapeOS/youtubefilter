      "description": "Today is an extremely exciting and historic day at AustraliaZoo! We are thrilled to welcome our Sumatran elephants to their new Elephantasia habitat. Guests can experience and fall in love with our gorgeous elephants and learn about our conservation work protecting this critically endangered species. In the past 25 years, over 70% of their wild habitat has been destroyed in Sumatra, leaving less than 2500 Sumatran elephants in existence. They need our support and protection now more than ever. We have worked closely with other organisations to build an elephant hospital in Sumatra to support this important species. We love Sumatran elephants with all our hearts and can\u2019t wait to share them with you. We\u2019re so proud to be continuing Steve\u2019s legacy and his mission to protect elephants forever. \ud83d\udc9a\ud83d\udc18\n\nKeep up to date with all things Australia Zoo -\n \nVisit our website : https://www.australiazoo.com.au/\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/AustraliaZoo/\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/australiazoo/?hl=en\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/AustraliaZoo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\n\nHere at Australia Zoo we are home to over 1200 beautiful animals and 400 staff.
