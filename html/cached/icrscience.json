We regularly receive testimonies from around the world about how ICR\u2019s cutting-edge work has impacted thousands of people with God\u2019s creation truth.\n\n---\n\n\u201cICR\u2019s most pressing assignment is to fundamentally change the way people understand biology. Our task is to construct a completely new theory of biological design that incorporates recent discoveries and respects the biblical narrative. The theory would explain hundreds of fascinating examples of creatures\u2019 abilities from an organism-centered, engineering-based perspective that gives glory to their Creator\u2014 and not to nature.\n\n\u201cWe hope this theory will become the fundamental, design-based principle uniting biological explanations in Christian textbooks and museums educating future generations of young believers. We pray that an engineering-based approach to biology will spark a second creationist revival\u2026and once again stir up a sense of certainty in Christian truth.\u201d\n\n\u2014 ICR President Dr. Randy Guliuzza\n\n---\n\nHow Can ICR Help You?\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/discover\n\nYou\u2019ll find faith-building science articles in Acts & Facts, our bimonthly science news magazine, and spiritual insight and encouragement from Days of Praise, our quarterly devotional booklet\u2014sign up for FREE: https://www.icr.org/subscriptions\n\nConnect with us on social media: https://www.icr.org/followicr\n\nTune in and subscribe to our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store for creation science books, DVDs, and other resources for every age and stage: https://store.icr.org/\n\nAttend or host a biblical creation event: https://www.icr.org/events/\n\nDiscover how science confirms the Bible at our Dallas creation museum and planetarium.

      "description": "Join us as the ICR Discovery Center hosts The Importance of Biblical Creation Seminar on Saturday, November 5! ICR Director of Donor Relations Chas Morse will answer seven questions about Genesis, biblical creation, and implications for your faith. Share this live stream with your family and friends for a faith-building, edifying creation event. \n\n---\n\nPreaching and teaching the biblical narrative of six-day creation and the worldwide Flood as real history is an essential doctrine of Scripture with practical present-day implications for believers in Christ.\n\nThe four primary educational goals for this series of lectures are as follows:\n\n\u2022 An increased confidence in the clarity and accuracy of God\u2019s Word especially as it pertains to Biblical Creation\n\u2022 Discover the importance of embracing a Biblical Creation worldview as it relates to the entirety of Scripture\n\u2022 Demonstrate how a true understanding of current scientific research affirms a historical and correct interpretation of Scripture\n\u2022 Acknowledge the implications for believers so that they will embrace living Biblically in this present age (Foundational text: 2 Peter 3:1-18)\n\n---\n\nIntroduction: Does Genesis Matter?\nIn this introductory session, Mr. Morse gives an overview of the importance of believing in a literal six-day creation and worldwide Flood as conveyed in Genesis. He defines biblical creation and then begins to explain how rejecting the creation account leads to other problems in properly understanding God\u2019s written Word.\n\nWhat Does the Bible Say About Biblical Creation?\nThe Bible clearly tells us how God created the universe and this is clearly taught throughout the pages of Scripture. Mr. Morse underscores the Bible's insistence that the world was made in 6 literal days and that the world was engulfed by a worldwide Flood\u2014a theme emphasized both in the Old and New Testaments.\n\nWhat Does Theology Say About Biblical Creation?\nBelieving in Biblical Creation is foundational in the gospel message and in other theological themes presented in Scripture. Mr. Morse unfolds several of these themes in this brief session.\n\nHow Does History Weigh Creation\u2019s Importance?\nMr. Morse will briefly discuss how the how church viewed creation and the Genesis Flood before, during, and after the Reformation? Also, we will see how the Reformation\u2019s focus on the clarity of Scripture shifted the church back to viewing creation and Flood as historical events.\n\nHow Is Creation Viewed in the Church Today?\nWhy are many pastors and Christian leaders today deferring to ideologies like evolution and natural selection rather than believing in the historical events of Genesis? Mr. Morse will discuss several reasons why we have seen this compromising shift.\n\nDoes Good Science Have Any Relationship to the Biblical Narrative?\nAre there conflicts between science and the Bible? Is there a relationship between what science is observing in creation and what\u2019s recorded in Scripture? Mr. Morse will show how true scientific discoveries affirm the works of God as they are recorded in Scripture.\n\nWhat Are the Creation Implications for a Believer\u2019s Sanctification?\nBelieving in a literal 6-day creation and a worldwide Flood makes a difference in one\u2019s Christian growth as discussed in 2 Peter 3:1-18.

      "description": "Ever since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution by means of natural selection, scientists have been eager to find proof. The hunt for clues to human evolution takes center stage.\n\nFossil specimens are frequently presented to the public as undeniable confirmation that modern man developed from an ape-like ancestor. Are these claims valid? Is the evidence so ironclad that no one can dispute it? Join ICR paleobiochemist Dr. Brian Thomas as he unravels some of the biases inherent in the scientific community and dismantles the claims regarding several alleged \"missing links.\"\n\nCan science and faith be reconciled? What should we believe about the Bible's account of human origins and Earth history? ICR's Creation Class series affirms the accuracy and reliability of Scripture. Join ICR experts as they teach how science\u2014from genetics to geology\u2014confirms the truth of God's Word.\n\n---\n\nJoin us for the Adam or Apes Film Premiere in Dallas, TX. on December 15 at the ICR Discovery Center.

This talk debunks the evolutionary idea of human races started by Charles Darwin and shows how modern genetics and the Bible prove that human diversity connects directly to the Biblical accounts of the creation of man, the global flood, and the confusion of languages and dispersal at the Tower of Babel.\n\n---\n\n\u2022 1:15 PM | Dr. Brian Thomas | Certainly Human: How Reproduction Reveals Creation\n\nDetails of human reproduction clearly show how mankind must have come from God, not primates. Middle school and older listeners will gain a new appreciation for the Creator\u2019s genius and find new confidence that God alone designed marriage and human life.\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/",

      "description": "Join us LIVE on February 11, 2023, for the Darwin Dethroned Seminar at the ICR Discovery Center in Dallas, Texas!\n\nEvolutionists mark the birth of Charles Darwin every February, as they venerate a man whose life\u2019s work was pivotal in establishing naturalistic thinking as the predominant worldview in Western Civilization. Countless people have been influenced by the publication of his most notable work \u201cThe Origin of the Species,\u201d and have accepted some form of Darwinian evolution as uncontested fact. But, how much has been discovered in the 160+ years since Darwin, that unravels his ideas and worldview, and unseats him as a legitimate authority on how creatures originate and adapt?\n\nICR\u2019s Darwin Dethroned Seminar examines the claims of Darwin, and modern Darwinists, who argue that the diversity of life forms came about from random, purposeless processes, over millions of years, and that creatures have adapted to their environments by means of a mysterious force deemed Natural Selection.\n\nScripture and the scientific evidence are clear: the Lord Jesus Christ purposefully engineered all things by His Word, and pre-programmed creatures to interact with and fill their environments through a complex system of innate sensors, logic mechanisms, and output responses in a way that far exceeds anything Darwin could've ever imagined.\n\n---\n\n\u2022 10:15 AM | Dr. Brian Thomas | The Beginning of Life\n\nUsing information you won\u2019t find in secular biology textbooks, Dr. Thomas demonstrates the complete failure of natural processes to explain how life began. He critiques evolutionary speculations about the beginning of life and illustrates the engineered precision in cellular machines to show that God\u2014not nature\u2014created life.\n\n---\n\n\u2022 11:15 AM | Dr. Tim Clarey | Geology and Deep Time\n\nIn this presentation, Dr. Clarey shows how sedimentary evidence across several continents confirms the occurrence of a global Flood. He presents oil industry data compiled into maps and diagrams that illustrate the progression of the Flood and match the biblical narrative. He provides biblically based scientific explanations for large-scale sedimentary deposits that were rapidly formed by catastrophic activity. This abundant evidence supports a worldwide Flood that happened just thousands of years ago.\n\n---\n\n\u2022 1:15 PM | Dr. Randy Guliuzza | It\u2019s Time to Do Biology as if Darwin Had Never Been Born \n\nThis presentation will introduce you to a groundbreaking new model called continuous environmental tracking (CET) that explains how organisms adapt. It is the first fully organism-focused, design-based explanation of adaptation to be developed by any organization. Christians should know that the latest scientific research is fully on the side of a design-based explanation of adaptation\u2026and evolutionists are trying to force-fit it into their theory. Some Intelligent Design advocates and creationists still see organisms as having been designed in part by a Designer and in part by nature, but there\u2019s no scientific reason for this. CET brings clarity and eliminates the mysticism inherent in all selection-based notions. Properly identify the true cause of organisms\u2019 dramatic capacity to self-adjust to different environments and you are on your way to the most powerful argument for a beneficent intelligent Designer consistent with the God of the Bible.\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/",

      "description": "Uncovering the Truth about Dinosaurs explores the most fascinating and mysterious creatures of all time - dinosaurs.\n\nFueled as much by popular culture as by science, dinosaurs capture the imagination. Footprints and fossilized bones prove they once existed, but many questions linger about what they were, where they came from, and how they lived and died. From the Institute for Creation Research, Uncovering the Truth about Dinosaurs takes on the challenge of unraveling these mysteries and unearthing the real truth.\n\nHost Markus Lloyd (Unlocking the Mysteries of Genesis and Made in His Image) journeys to various locations to investigate some of the common theories about dinosaurs, while experts in subjects like paleontology, geology, archaeology, and history examine evidence that casts doubt on secular theories about geologic time and evolution.\n\nUncovering the Truth about Dinosaurs offers compelling evidence about these mysterious creatures that confirms the biblical account of Genesis. Witness the awesome work of the Creator and see how the Bible gets it right in all matters -- including dinosaurs.\n\nPurchase here: https://store.icr.org/uncovering-the-truth-about-dinosaurs-dvd-series.html\n\nDigital version available here: https://store.icr.org/uncovering-the-truth-about-dinosaurs-dvd-series-do.html\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nOr join us on Patreon:\npatreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch",

You will learn what the image of God is and why only human beings bear this precious gift. This image gives humans a special status in creation and has real day-to-day implications. It\u2019s the most important factor in how people should treat each other and other creatures across the whole spectrum of life.\n\n\n\u2022 11:25 AM | Ms. Amy Ford (Embrace Grace) | Best Gift Ever\n\nMs. Ford, the founder of Embrace Grace, will be speaking about how this organization equips single and pregnant mothers in all 50 states and the world with Hope.\n\n\n\u2022 1:00 PM | Ms. Leanne Jamieson (Prestonwood Pregnancy Center) | Pregnancy Center Ministry in a Post-Roe World\n\nMs. Jamieson will talk about the ministry to abortion-determined women in a Post-Roe world. Abortion is illegal in the state of Texas, but we are far from it being unthinkable or unattainable. How are Believers called to action, and what does the changing landscape of ministry look like, given the victories had at the Supreme Court level? Ms. Jamieson will also discuss the abortion pill and abortion pill reversal and include powerful stories of life.\n\n\n\u2022 1:40 PM | Q&A Session\n\n---\n\nTo become a member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nTo become a patron: http://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\n--- \n\nPlease note that the presence of guests on ICR media does not constitute an endorsement of their comments, views, platforms, or doctrinal positions by ICR.

      "description": "This video will be made available to the public on July 30, 2024.\n\nFrom 1941 to 1945, Nazi Germany and its allies systematically murdered approximately six million Jews in a genocide known as the Holocaust. This was, at the time, around two-thirds of Europe\u2019s Jewish population. Alongside the Jews, others who had been deemed \u2018inferior\u2019 suffered during the Nazi\u2019s reign. This included the Roma, the Polish, people of Slavic descent, black people, the mentally ill, and the disabled. But why? To what end? In this three-part series, we\u2019re going to look at the roots of the Holocaust from a scientific perspective as well as uncover the Darwinian undercurrent that allowed it all to take place.\n\nIn our previous episodes, we discussed the philosophers and thought leaders that set the stage for the atrocities of the holocaust and the specifics of scientific racism, eugenics, and attempted genocide as practiced by Nazi Germany. Today, we\u2019ll wrap things up by looking at how this natural consequence of Darwinian evolution stands in stark contrast to what Scripture says about who we are and our purpose on this planet.\n\nJoin Trey and ICR President, Dr. Randy Guliuzza as they discuss this vital topic on Episode 78 of The Creation Podcast.\n\n\u2014\n\nTo become a member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nTo become a patron: http://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n\u2014\n\nDo you have questions about science or Scripture?

In this podcast, we ask the question, Might it eventually be possible for biblical creationists to actually explain this extreme longevity?\n\nJoin host Ren\u00e9e Dusseau and Dr. Jake Hebert as they discuss this topic on episode 81 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nDo Tiny Mammal Fossils Corroborate Pre-Flood Longevity?\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/tiny-mammal-fossils-corroborate-longevity/\n\nOysters and Pre-Flood Longevity\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/oysters-pre-flood-longevity\n\nFossil Sharks Show Signs of Greater Past Longevity\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/fossil-sharks-signs-longevity/\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nChapters:\n0:00 \u2013 Coming Up on The Creation Podcast\n0:33 \u2013 Welcome and Introduction\n1:36 \u2013 Recap and Additional Evidence\n6:06 \u2013 From the Ice Age to Longevity\n8:12 \u2013 Physics, Biology, and Scaling\n14:47 \u2013 The Obstacles\n16:15 \u2013 Pre-Flood Humans\n18:02 \u2013 Is This Reversable?\n22:48 \u2013 There is Hope\n25:38 \u2013 CET and Longevity\n30:09 \u2013 Concluding Thoughts",

We are told that history, archaeology, and science contradict supernatural creation and that there were no Adam and Eve in a Garden of Eden, so their sin didn\u2019t bring death into the world.\n\nBut does the evidence support the truth of the Bible\u2019s opening book? Could it be that Genesis is vitally important to how we understand our world, our lives, and the God who made us? Does it provide the foundation we need for all aspects of faith, science, and culture?\n\nDr. Thomas, author of Living in Light of Genesis, learned to accept the Bible\u2019s history as literally truth not in spite of historical scientific knowledge, but in light of that knowledge.\n\nJoin host Ren\u00e9e Dusseau and Dr. Brian Thomas as they discuss this topic on episode 82 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nPurchase Living in Light of Genesis here: https://store.icr.org/living-in-light-of-genesis.html\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nChapters:\n0:00 \u2013 Coming Up on The Creation Podcast\n0:27 \u2013 Welcome and Introduction\n1:37 \u2013 Why This?

      "description": "This video will be made public on November 19, 2024.\n\nScience is objective. At least, that\u2019s what we\u2019re told. But there are inherent issues with this statement that can cause very real confusion. How can two rational, intelligent people look at the same piece of evidence and offer different explanations for their observations\u2014and not just different, but mutually exclusive. What causes this divide, and what can we do about it?\n\nIn the previous episode, we looked at the purpose and power of theory. Now we\u2019ll look at how evolutionary selectionism, the current reigning theory, is purposefully crafted to be anti-design, and therefore remove any sort of Designer from the equation.\n\nJoin host Ren\u00e9e Dusseau and Dr. Randy Guliuzza as they discuss this topic on episode 86 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\n0:00 \u2013 Coming Up on The Creation Podcast\n1:05 \u2013 Welcome and Introduction\n2:28 \u2013 Why Should We Care?\n18:59 \u2013 The Agenda of Selectionism\n34:05 \u2013 The Essential Elements of an Anti-Design Theory \n45:37 \u2013 Concluding Thoughts",

Many geologists claim these layers were laid down slowly over vast spans of time, but where is the evidence? What do the rocks actually show? Join ICR geologist Dr. Timothy Clarey as he digs through the rock record and explores Earth's megasequences to uncover the truth.\n\nCan science and faith be reconciled? What should we believe about the Bible's account of human origins and Earth history?

      "description": "Genesis and Revelation provide stunning bookends of the biblical canon. The first describes the beginning of creation while the second gives us insight into future eternity. Both are vital pieces of Scripture and yet, without fail, they are two of the most highly questioned books of the Bible. Are these accounts true? Can they be trusted?

But there are inherent issues with this statement that can cause very real confusion. How can two rational, intelligent people look at the same piece of evidence and offer different explanations for their observations\u2014and not just different, but mutually exclusive. What causes this divide, and what can we do about it?\n\nIn the previous episodes, we looked at the purpose and power of theory, and how evolutionary selectionism, the current reigning theory, is purposefully crafted to be anti-design. In this episode, we\u2019ll look at how to reverse Darwin\u2019s thought processes to develop a theory of biological design that actually works.\n\nJoin host Ren\u00e9e Dusseau and Dr. Randy Guliuzza as they discuss this topic on episode 87 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\n0:00 \u2013 Coming Up on The Creation Podcast\n1:05 \u2013 Welcome and Introduction\n2:55 \u2013 Darwin\u2019s Devious Design\n7:55 \u2013 Moving Beyond Positive Evidence\n14:36 \u2013 The Tenets of a Theory of Biological Design\n20:52 \u2013 The Prime Directive\n22:00 \u2013 Life Enables Biological Processes\n29:25 \u2013 Remove Mystical Steps\n37:30 \u2013 Purposeful, Top-Down Planning\n41:37 \u2013 Active Organisms Shape Themselves\n51:16 \u2013 Organisms are Elements of Ecosystems\n57:57 \u2013 ICR\u2019s Next Steps\n1:02:58 \u2013 Concluding Thoughts",

At least, that\u2019s what we\u2019re told. But there are inherent issues with this statement that can cause very real confusion. How can two rational, intelligent people look at the same piece of evidence and offer different explanations for their observations\u2014and not just different, but mutually exclusive. What causes this divide, and what can we do about it?\n\nIn the previous episodes, we looked at the purpose and power of theory; how evolutionary selectionism, the current reigning theory, is purposefully crafted to be anti-design; and how to reverse Darwin\u2019s thought processes to develop a theory of biological design that actually works. In this episode, we\u2019ll look at how the benefits of a theory of biological design as well as a general overview of what it means to look at organisms with such a perspective.\n\nJoin host Ren\u00e9e Dusseau and Dr. Randy Guliuzza as they discuss this topic on episode 88 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\n0:00 \u2013 Coming Up on The Creation Podcast\n1:05 \u2013 Welcome and Introduction\n2:10 \u2013 The Benefits of a Theory of Biological Design\n2:45 \u2013 1.

How do we measure its worth, and what steps can we take to protect and cherish it? These profound questions are at the heart of ongoing debates in today\u2019s culture, where ideas about the meaning and value of life are often challenged. To find true and lasting answers, we must look to the Creator of life, the ultimate source of purpose and design, for a correct understanding of what it means to be human and why life is sacred.\n\nICR president Dr. Randy Guliuzza will delve into the extraordinary design behind human life, highlighting the intricate complexity and purpose that reflect the work of an intelligent Creator. His insights will offer a fresh perspective on why human life is not only unique but also precious beyond measure. Additionally, Mr. Jay Seegert, founder of The Starting Point Project, will equip attendees with practical tools to defend the value of life in a culture often at odds with its sacredness. His dynamic presentation will empower individuals to confidently articulate the reasons why every human life is worth protecting and honoring.\n\nThis seminar will be an enlightening experience, combining science, faith, and apologetics to deepen our appreciation for the Creator's handiwork and strengthen our ability to advocate for the sanctity of life in our communities and beyond. Join us for this inspiring event and take part in celebrating the wonder and value of human life.\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/",

      "description": "Join us LIVE on January 18, 2025, to celebrate the sanctity of human life during ICR's annual Made in His Image Seminar at the ICR Discovery Center. \n\nWhat determines the value of human life? How do we measure its worth, and what steps can we take to protect and cherish it? These profound questions are at the heart of ongoing debates in today\u2019s culture, where ideas about the meaning and value of life are often challenged. To find true and lasting answers, we must look to the Creator of life, the ultimate source of purpose and design, for a correct understanding of what it means to be human and why life is sacred.\n\nICR president Dr. Randy Guliuzza will delve into the extraordinary design behind human life, highlighting the intricate complexity and purpose that reflect the work of an intelligent Creator. His insights will offer a fresh perspective on why human life is not only unique but also precious beyond measure. Additionally, Mr. Jay Seegert, founder of The Starting Point Project, will equip attendees with practical tools to defend the value of life in a culture often at odds with its sacredness. His dynamic presentation will empower individuals to confidently articulate the reasons why every human life is worth protecting and honoring.\n\nThis seminar will be an enlightening experience, combining science, faith, and apologetics to deepen our appreciation for the Creator's handiwork and strengthen our ability to advocate for the sanctity of life in our communities and beyond. Join us for this inspiring event and take part in celebrating the wonder and value of human life.\n\n---\n\nTo become a member on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nTo become a patron: http://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/",

      "description": "Earth races around the sun at 67,000 miles per hour, yet it remains the only known planet to support life. Why does our world have the perfect conditions for oceans, seasons, and breathable air, while thousands of others remain barren and lifeless? Is this just a cosmic fluke, or is there something special about our home?\n\nJoin us for episode two of Creation Connection as we explore why Earth\u2019s position in the \u2018Goldilocks Zone\u2019 makes it the ultimate home\u2014neither scorched nor frozen, but perfectly suited for life. From its precise orbit to the stabilizing role of the moon and protective atmosphere, everything about our planet appears fine-tuned for our survival. Could it really be an accident, or is it the work of a masterful Creator?\n\nWith insights from physicist Dr. Jake Hebert and a closer look at what the Bible says, we\u2019ll uncover the science behind our planet\u2019s perfect placement and what it reveals about its origins. When you examine the details, Earth seems less like a lucky break and more like a work of genius.\n\nPour yourself a bowl of porridge (optional), and don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and ring the bell!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqD\n\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\n---\n\nCredit: Solar system image by vectorpouch on Freepik | https://www.freepik.com/",

      "description": "When Charles Darwin introduced natural selection, it became the foundation of modern evolutionary theory. But does it truly explain the complexity of life\u2014or is it just a convenient replacement for divine design?\n\nIn this episode of Creation Connection, we dive deep into the idea of natural selection, exploring its scientific weaknesses, the language used to describe it, and why even some evolutionary scientists are questioning its validity. Is nature really an agent of change, or is there a better explanation for the way creatures adapt?\n\nJoin us as we explore Continuous Environmental Tracking (CET)\u2014a groundbreaking model that aligns with both science and Scripture, showing how creatures are designed to adapt from within.\n\nFeaturing insights from experts, thought-provoking evidence, and a fresh look at Darwin\u2019s own words, this episode challenges the conventional narrative on evolution.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and hit the bell so you never miss an episode!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqD\n\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\nSyncID MB01PSFYWIXICZK",

      "description": "Fossils offer a fascinating glimpse into Earth\u2019s past\u2014but what if they tell a different story than what we\u2019ve been taught? Evolutionists claim that the fossil record reveals a slow progression from simple to complex life. But one of the earliest layers, the Cambrian, presents a major problem: a sudden explosion of fully-formed, complex creatures with no clear evolutionary ancestors.\n\nIn this episode of Creation Connection, we dive into the mystery of the Cambrian Explosion. Why do we see clams, trilobites, and starfish appearing all at once in the fossil record? Where are the transitional forms Darwin himself admitted were missing? And why do so many Cambrian creatures still look the same today?\n\nDr. Timothy Clarey joins us as we explore how the Cambrian Explosion challenges the core tenets of evolution and how the global flood provides a better explanation for the evidence.\n\nLearn why evolutionists have been struggling with this problem for over a century, and don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and ring the bell!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqD\n\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\nSyncID: MB01CNYWMSZZUXG",

      "description": "This video will be made public on March 11, 2025.\n\nWelcome to the first episode in a series called \u201cThe Failures of Old Earth Creationism.\u201d Many Christians attempt to fit old earth ideology into their beliefs, adopting uniformitarian or evolutionary pieces into their worldview. While this is often done in an effort to appeal to science, it often leads to major issues logically, scientifically, and theologically.\n\nToday we\u2019ll look at what is considered by many to be a strong argument for an old Earth: ice cores. Ice cores, cylindrical cores drilled from the thick ice sheets, are often presented as indisputable evidence of hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of years of Earth\u2019s history, but how reliable are these claims? What assumptions lie beneath the surface of these interpretations? In this episode, we\u2019ll discuss: what ice cores are and why they\u2019re significant, the assumptions and flaws in Old Earth interpretations, and how ice cores ultimately align with a young Earth model.\n\nJoin host Trey Bowling and Dr. Jake Hebert as they discuss this topic on episode 93 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nThe debate mentioned in this podcast: https://www.youtube.com/live/ciQLb_ei4_0?si=1GnhN6jbkRG8Ypjc\n\nThe Ice Age and Climate Change: https://store.icr.org/the-ice-age-and-climate-change.html\n\nAdditional reading:\n\nMilankovitch Meltdown\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/9696\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/physics-today-ignores-monster-milankovitch-problem\n\nYoung Ice Sheets\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/earths-thick-ice-sheets-are-young\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/8181\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/ice-core-research-continues/\n\nExplaining the Ice Age:\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/the-bible-best-explains-the-ice-age\nhttps://www.icr.org/article/missing-ice-age-forests-fit-flood-ice-age-model\n\nAdditional Credits:\n\u201cParrenin et al.

Have you ever wondered what it feels like to hold a freshly dug dinosaur fossil in your hands, or to see other animals buried along with dinosaurs, providing evidence for the global flood? Now is your time to make this dream a reality!\n\nWe are excited to announce our second Dinosaur Dig Experience! This year, we will be digging in the fossil-rich landscapes of Glendive, Montana. We invite you to roll up your sleeves with us, grab a digging tool, and uncover the mysterious creatures that lie within the sediment layers of this barren land.\n\nThis dino dig isn\u2019t just about digging. It\u2019s about learning, exploring, and examining the evidence that demonstrates a catastrophic global flood. You\u2019ll have the unique opportunity to learn from ICR's Director of Research Dr. Tim Clarey, Field Paleontologist Mr. Tommy Lohman, and Glendive Dinosaur and Fossil Museum Director Mr. Robert Canen. Who knows what you will discover!\n\nNo experience? No problem! Whether you\u2019re a seasoned fossil hunter or a curious first-timer, our experienced team will guide you every step of the way.

But how much do we really know about the Ice Age, and does the popular narrative hold up under scrutiny?\n\nIn this episode of Creation Connection, we take a cold plunge into the science behind Ice Age theories, from the widely accepted Milankovitch cycles to an alternative model grounded in the biblical record. Uniformitarian scientists propose multiple Ice Ages stretching over millions of years, but does the evidence actually support that claim? Or is there a better explanation\u2014one that fits within a young earth framework?\n\nJoin us as we break the ice on this fascinating topic with insights from physicist Dr. Jake Hebert, who presents the H.E.A.T. model\u2014a biblically consistent explanation of the Ice Age following the Genesis Flood. We\u2019ll explore what caused the Ice Age, how long it lasted, and what it means for our understanding of earth\u2019s history.\n\nGrab your best winter coat, and don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and ring the bell for more episodes of Creation Connection!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqD\n\nThe Ice Age and Climate Change: https://store.icr.org/the-ice-age-and-climate-change.html\n\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\nSyncID MB01CNYWMSZZUXG",

      "description": "For decades, scientists assumed that dinosaur fossils were millions of years old, with all organic material long gone. But then\u2014an accident changed everything. Dr. Mary Schweitzer\u2019s groundbreaking discovery of soft tissue inside a T. rex bone sent shockwaves through the scientific community. Red blood cells? Collagen? Flexible material? These things shouldn\u2019t exist if dinosaurs died out 65+ million years ago\u2026 right?\n\nSo how did this soft tissue survive? Are mainstream scientists ignoring the evidence? And what does this mean for evolutionary theory?\n\nSome scientists scrambled for explanations, but none of them hold up under scrutiny. Could this be evidence that dinosaurs lived much more recently than we\u2019ve been told? And does this discovery fit better with a biblical timeline?\n\nDr. Brian Thomas joins us as we explore how soft tissues found in fossils challenge mainstream thinking and what it really means for the age of dinosaurs (and other fossil creatures.)\n\nLearn why this is such a big deal, and don\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and ring the bell!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqD\n\nAncient and Fossil Bone Collagen Remnants: https://store.icr.org/ancient-and-fossil-bone-collagen-remnants.html\n\nLiving in Light of Genesis: https://store.icr.org/living-in-light-of-genesis.html\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\nSyncID: MB01CNYWMSZZUXG",

While this is often done in an effort to appeal to science, it can cause major logical, scientific, and theological issues.\n\nThe conversation surrounding human origins has always been an intriguing one. One of the most debated subjects is the nature of the beings labeled \u2018hominids,\u2019 particularly Neanderthals. Biblical Creationists firmly place Neanderthals in the \u2018human\u2019 category\u2014descendants of Adam and Eve, thus bearing God\u2019s image. Most evolutionary biologists today also agree with Neanderthals being mostly human, leaving their genetic mark on our DNA through interbreeding.\n\nSome old earth creationists suggest something quite different. They claim that Neanderthals were nothing more than animals\u2014truly bipedal animals that are able to make and use tools, paint, and bury their dead\u2014but animals nonetheless.\n\nIs there any truth to this idea? Were they just animals? Or were they fully human, bearing the image of God? In today\u2019s episode, we\u2019ll dig into \u201cThe Mystery of the Soulless Hominids,\u201d exploring the faulty beliefs that lead some down this path, and uncovering what science and Scripture say about the matter.\n\nJoin host Trey Bowling and Dr. Brian Thomas as they discuss this topic on episode 94 of The Creation Podcast.\n\nAdam or Apes: https://store.icr.org/adam-or-apes.html\n\nContested Bones: https://store.icr.org/dr-john-sanford-contested-bones.html\n\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\n---\n\n0:00 \u2013 Coming Up on The Creation Podcast\n1:02 \u2013 Welcome and Introduction\n3:37 \u2013 What are \u2018hominids?\u2019\n6:11 \u2013 Who is Neanderthal?\n15:46 \u2013 Soulless Hominids\n22:01 \u2013 The Time (and Gospel) Problem\n25:43 \u2013 Image of God Behavior\n34:40 \u2013 The Genetics Problem\n36:33 \u2013 Compromising God\u2019s Word\n47:31 \u2013 Concluding Thoughts",

From running marathons to sculpting masterpieces, the human body is capable of incredible feats. But could something this intricate really be the product of blind evolutionary processes?\n\nIn this episode of Creation Connection, we take a deep dive into the systems that keep you alive, exploring the precise interdependence of your body\u2019s design. Evolutionists claim that humans evolved piece by piece over millions of years, but does the evidence actually support that? Or does the complexity of the human body point to something greater\u2014something designed?\n\nWe\u2019ll also tackle the claim that the human eye is \"badly designed\" and expose the flaws in that argument. Plus, we\u2019ll explore the amazing structure of the human hand and why scientists struggle to replicate its abilities.\n\nJoin us as we examine the evidence, challenge evolutionary assumptions, and uncover the truth about what makes us truly human.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to like, subscribe, and ring the bell for more episodes!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqD\n\nAncient and Fossil Bone Collagen Remnants: https://store.icr.org/ancient-and-fossil-bone-collagen-remnants.html\n\nLiving in Light of Genesis: https://store.icr.org/living-in-light-of-genesis.html\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\nSyncID: MB01CNYWMSZZUXG",

It was the most studied volcanic eruption in history, and what researchers discovered challenges long-held assumptions about Earth's history.\n\nJoin us for this episode of Creation Connection as we explore how this modern catastrophe reshaped our understanding of geology, rock layers, radiometric dating, and even the recovery of ecosystems.

From dino-birds to ape-men, the fossil record is full of candidates\u2026 or is it?\n\nIn this eye-opening episode of Creation Connection, you'll embark on a wild ride through some of the most famous (and infamous) fossil finds that were once hailed as evolutionary slam dunks\u2014until they weren\u2019t.\n\nFrom the savage stereotypes of Neanderthal Man, to the jaw-dropping (and jaw-faked) Piltdown hoax, to National Geographic\u2019s feathered fiasco, and a lemur who got way too much press\u2014this episode uncovers how imagination, ideology, and a dash of desperation can lead even experts down the wrong path.\n\nWith commentary from Dr. Brian Thomas and a close look at what Scripture actually says, we pull back the curtain on the myth of transitional fossils and reveal why the truth is often far simpler\u2014and far more Biblical\u2014than the mainstream wants you to believe.\n\nSettle in, grab a snack, and make sure to like, subscribe, and ring the bell!\n\nWatch the whole series here: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwhfxndgaHD90YdvAqJ2Mxq1-2AXXqH0R&si=ywE2bBvShne4haqDl\n\n---\n\nJoin this channel to get access to perks:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCH2PLuQwGuY_Q9NvNng7Twg/join\n\nJoin us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/InstituteforCreationResearch\n\n---\n\nFollow us!\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/icrscience\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/icrscience/\nX (Twitter): https://twitter.com/ICRscience\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/institute-for-creation-research\nPinterest: https://in.pinterest.com/icrscience/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@icrscience\n\n---\n\nLearn more about the Institute for Creation Research: https://www.icr.org/\n\nCheck out our podcasts: https://www.icr.org/podcasts\n\nShop our store: https://store.icr.org/\n\nSupport our ministry: https://www.icr.org/donate\n\nPlan your visit to our Dallas creation museum and planetarium: https://discoverycenter.icr.org/\n\nSyncID MB01PSFYWIXICZK",
