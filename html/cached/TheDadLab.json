      "description": "Subscribe to my channel and wait for Alex\u2019s space adventure floating drawing! To make your art creation float you need just white board makers, a plate and some water. I have seen a few videos about this technique but they all seemed to require to much and didn't promise result. So here is the ultimate guide to make your drawings float. First you need regular fresh dry erase markers. Old ones usually do not work. Just test your magic water markers before you do the activity. Draw a circle with each marker on a plate, pour some water and if the circle floats, you are ready to go. You can use a piece of glass or laminated sheet, however I recommend using a regular plate. When you draw something, make sure you are colouring all the bits inside of the drawing, to make sure the drawing is strong enough to float. Blow to make your drawings move \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.\n=====================================================\n#toys #preschooler #homeschool #fatherhood #science",

At the start, all the disks are on one side, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest on the top. The object of the game is to move all the disks over to the other side. You can only move one disk per move, and you can only move the top disk on a stack. Disks can only be moved to empty stacks or on top of larger disks. Parents can play this game too, just add extra discs.\nGet your stacker here http://geni.us/stacker\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.",

Our today's ToyReviewTuesday is dedicated to a Giant Car Play Mat from Le Toy Van. It features an entire town with incredible detail including, fire station, a construction site, a train station, a hospital, and others. That gives Max an opportunity to find a place on the mat for any scenario he imagines to play. We didn't need to get new cars to play on this mat as roads were perfectly scaled for popular toy cars size.\nGet yours here http://geni.us/carplaymat\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go",

We have connected two bottles with a tube (we got it from here http://geni.us/tornado) but you can just connect them with a tape, just make sure you put a metal washer between bottles to make the hole smaller. Spinning the top bottle in a circular motion creates a water vortex that looks like a tornado.

Pieces here are magnetic, but magnets inside do not rotate and therefore pieces have \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201c sides. That means that every time Alex wants to connect a new piece he needs to figure out what colour he needs for it to stick. It does give him a nice additional challenge when he builds 3D shapes. We have a few other sets from this range, but I like this one best because it isn't that big and it allows to build amazing shapes combinations.

It\u2019s a uniquely formulated foam that only sticks to itself and doesn't leave sticky residue behind and is great for sensory play for children aged 3+. Sticking Playfoam to cards helps children to familiarize themselves with shapes of numbers. Max, of course, couldn't resist mixing all the colours together.\nGet your set here http://geni.us/playfoam\n***\nThis is not an ad.

The second one was for Alex where he started with 10 points and as the marble was going thru the loops Alex had to do correct calculations.

The best part about this set is that it encourages Max to talk about it all the time. It is like Show&Tell all day long. He comes up with names for every creation and then explains what that vehicle is used for.\n\nGet your set here http://geni.us/mixvehicles\n***\nThis is not an ad. I choose toys myself, reach out to companies that provide them for free. Only if I am 100% happy with the toy, I recommend it to you\n\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go",

Children breathe in more air than adults, meaning air pollution affects them more. Indoor air can be up to 5 times more polluted and even so we often spend time in nature, we do return home at the end. After switching our @Philips Air Purifier on [http://philips.to/2u7WES9] for the first time, it tested the air and quickly removed dust, pollen and even viruses in the room. Since then we have been enjoying beautifully clean air and talking about it a lot. Today we have done a simple science experiment allowing Alex to touch the air. How clean is the air where you are?\n#Sponsored #TheDadLab #BreatheTheDifference #London\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.",

It is like paint-by-numbers, but instead of pencils, Alex uses stickers to cover spaces. Each sticker has its own number, so the book is good for practising numbers too. Perforated pages are easy to remove from the book either to make it easier to match stickers or to display finished masterpiece.

      "description": "In promotional partnership with Apple. Last week we went to our local Apple store for Kids Hour program where Alex was taught how to code the Droids from Star Wars. First Alex was given an opportunity to familiarize himself with commands that robots can do by playing with them on a table. I should say that one droid went down before Alex got the hang of it. But then Alex built a maze on a floor with a tape and he was taught how to code to make a robot change directions and speed. All in all, we had a great time there and learned something new too.  I want you and your children to have the awesome experience we had. #TodayAtApple isn't only about coding skills, there are programs in music, art, photography, and videography too, they run globally every day and best of all they are free. So visit http://apple.co/todayatapple and find a session in your local Apple store that is right for you.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go",

Each of 12 letters has a topic that varies from happy birthday wishes to future yourself to sharing current favourite poems. To enjoy this book a child should be able to write as well as read. Alex just loved it and he has already finished it and sealed all envelopes with a sticker before I had a chance to read them. I just hope that Alex would be able to read what he wrote when he is older and he gets those letters from me.\nGet yours here http://geni.us/letters [aff link]\nPlease keep in mind that I chose this book myself, reached out to Chronicle Books that gifted it to us.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.\n=====================================================\n#toys #preschooler #homeschool #fatherhood #science",

You can add anything you like to it: raisins, seeds, nuts... you name it! Whatever ingredients you choose, you will definitely taste the difference comparing to store-bought chocolate. \nIngredients:\n- 1 cup of Coconut Oil (or Raw Cacao Butter)\n- 1 cup of Raw Cacao Powder\n- 1/2 cup of Maple Syrup\n- Pinch of Vanilla Powder\n- Pinch of Fine Sea Salt\n- Handful of chopped nuts, seeds or dried berries (optional)\n\nI put Coconut Oil in a glass and to melt it I put the glass in a bowl with hot water. Alex mixed all ingredients to make an easy to pour mixture. He then poured the melted chocolate into moulds and I left it in the freezer for about 15 minutes to harden. That was it! Ready to eat straight after that. If you make too much chocolate, make sure you keep it in the fridge otherwise coconut oil might melt (:\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.\n=====================================================\n#toys #preschooler #homeschool #fatherhood #science",

I do not influence their decisions, so getting a set of ten colourful sponges scourers is a normal thing (: Every year they surprise us with hilarious gifts.

Vibrantly coloured wooden pieces inspired Alex to endlessly build futuristic structures. I can't believe that Cubicus was designed in 1968 and I only found out about it now.

      "description": "This is an impressive but simple experiment for children. We did it with Alex about two years ago, so it was Max's turn now. But this time I added a bit of a twist though.  I spread food colouring on the bottom of tea candle, lighted it and placed it at the centre of a plate with water. The good thing about tea candles, they float and that is very useful for this experiment. Then it can be covered with a jar, but we used a vase for the more dramatic result. The bigger is the jar the more water is sucked into it. \nEXPLANATION: The flame burns oxygen and the lack of it makes the candle go out, however, this is not the reason why water is sucked in. The actual reason is hidden in the temperature of the air and how the density of the air changes with temperature. When the candle is heating up the air, it expands getting out of the vase (you can actually see how bubbles of air are coming out in the video). When the candle goes out, the air starting to cool down. Cold air is denser and therefore it needs less space, so it shrinks sucking the water into the vase. \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.",

We have started with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz because for a while it has been Alex's most often picked story for mummy to read to him. The book is just stunning where fairy tale literally jumps at the reader with different actions. Alex loved having his own green sunglasses that made him live the story from the book. He hasn't been scared away with a big volume of text as all texts are hidden in specially designed flips with small surprise pop-ups, so he loves exploring and reading the book on his own.\nGet yours here http://geni.us/wizardofoz [aff]\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.",

I added a little too many leaves, so I had to add more water to glasses for clearer colours. Then Alex started adding lemon juice, vinegar, baking soda and washing powder to separate glasses, leaving middle glass untouched. The purple cabbage juice turns red when it mixes with acids and turns blue/green when it mixes with base.

Pages in the book arranged the way that a parent and a child can colour one picture together, where adults side is much more detailed. I didn't remember when I coloured something by myself so I was quite excited to try it. By the time we finished colouring the first picture, we have discussed our day, plans for the weekend and theories about dinosaurs extinction. It is easy to take pages out of the book if you fancy framing your artwork\nThe book will be available to buy soon.

I have dipped eggshell in water, and now it rotates instead of just sliding every time we tilt the plate. If instead of making eggshell wet, you spread water across the rim of the plate, you can make eggshell go in circles at the very edge of it. Try it now and share with us how did it go.

When I was making this, it was a bit of a challenge to align all four markers so that they touch paper at the same time. But there is a trick - use only 3 markers and you will not need to align them at all, proving something we were taught at school - \"through any three noncollinear points, there is exactly one plane\". In our case, the tips of markers are points and a piece of paper is a plane.

      "description": "Today on ToyReviewTuesday we present Inventor Kit from Infento that allows families to build a range of rides, avoiding the situation when the house is jammed with ride-ons and scooters. As children grow or their interests change, we can dismantle an old ride and build a new one by following manuals or by engineering something completely unique. Sometimes the building process takes a while, but we enjoy it as we learn a lot and have fun by creating rides together.\nGet yours here: http://geni.us/infento\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.",

However, he had some help from an inappropriately white apron, convenient Plenty Handy Towels and his inherent precision. We used spinach for GREEN, turmeric for YELLOW, cacao powder for BROWN and strawberry with beets for shades of RED. We got some bright coloured paints and although they came with different tastes and smells varying from \"I want to eat it\" to \"take it away from me\" they were still good enough for creating a masterpiece.

      "description": "Today on ToyReviewTuesday we have a unique handcrafted puzzle - Logifaces. It challenged us to find a way to place the prisms with different top angles next to each other to form a continuous surface. Alex had fun finding matches to make a small triangle, and then together we build a big one too. But it is not all about the result at the end, but rather about the process that is quite meditative. Max took a different approach by building his original pattern while having a stimulating tactile experience with made-of-concrete pieces.\nGet yours here: https://geni.us/logifaces\n#TheDadLab #puzzles #toys #playandlearn\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\nMy main topics include: unique, creative, educational toys for kids, kids science experiments, fun educational activities, must have products for children, kids fashion, dad\u2019s lifestyle, children friendly places to go.",

Place the glass over the ball and then start spinning the glass around in a circular motion. Once the ball starts spinning inside the glass, lift it from the table. Watch out! If the ball isn\u2019t spinning enough, then you won\u2019t be able to lift it.  Alex tried his best. It took a few goes, but he was so pleased when he did it. Can you keep the ball spinning long enough inside the glass to move it across the table? \n#TheDadLab #science #parentlife\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

The book still includes some of the best creative projects we have ever done. To make even most ambitious experiments from the book, you still would not need any special skills or ingredients. To help parents, it still explains the science behind all experiments in simple words. But on top of all that, I have supercharged it with additional 10 awesome projects!!! I have spent countless sleepless nights working on it, and it is finally here. After receiving messages from many readers thanking me for the inspiration and sharing how TheDadLab book helps their families to bond and keeps boys and girls interested in science, I am delighted to be able to spread that a bit further into the world. \nPlease name your city in the comments below, and I will try to make sure my book is sold there.\n#TheDadLab\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

It is difficult to determine what type of activity it is - a bit of art, a bit of science, but what I can say for sure it is messy (: To get ready, I went outside and sprayed a lot of fabric protector into a glass of coloured sand, mixed it and dried it. It took a few hours to dry. I have done this only once, but if you want to make the sand more water repellent, repeat the process two or three times.\n#TheDadLab #learnandplay #science\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "#ad\u00a0| Inspired by Disney's Frozen 2 and\u00a0#LEGO, this is a fun challenge to pick up a piece of ice with a string! The secret is to use salt and a bit of\u00a0Frozen\u00a02 magic (: Wet the string, put it flat on the ice, sprinkle a bit of salt and after ten seconds lift the string up. The ice should have been stuck to the string by then. What happens here is that salt dissolves in a thin layer of water above the ice. Salty water has a lower freezing temperature comparing to freshwater, so it makes ice to melt, absorbing the heat in the process. Ice takes some of that heat from water causing it to freeze back again trapping our string\n#TheDadLab\u00a0#Frozen2\u00a0#LEGOFrozen\u00a0#playandlearn\u00a0#Disney\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

We have prepared a bubble solution by mixing water and washing up liquid, made a frame from a wire and tied a piece of a thread in a loop. Then we dipped the thread in the bubble solution and put it on top of the bubble. When we popped the bubble inside the loop, it made the thread to form a perfect circle with a hole inside. Pretty cool! This hole can be moved across the bubble surface, and most importantly, children can put their hands inside it (:\n#TheDadLab #kidsactivities #fatherlikeson #toyfair\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

And it really is! @LEGO\u00a0BOOST combines building with programming and offers hours and hours of playing and learning. When I say \"hours and hours\" I mean it took Alex a few weeks to independently build all five models in the set and go through all the programming challenges. If you think that programming is an essential skill for children to learn, you will love how\u00a0LEGO\u00a0BOOST teaches it. A free app offers a simple drag & drop coding interface and introduces new functions like loops, random number generator and variables gradually so that it does not overwhelm the child. At the same time from Alex's point of view, it wasn't all about coding but rather about bringing his #LEGO\u00a0creations to life. Watch the video till the end to see all five models Alex has built with this set: funky robot Vernie, versatile Guitar4000, AutoBuilder that builds mini\u00a0LEGO\u00a0robots, Multi-Tooled Rover 4 and his favourite - cute cat Frankie\n#TheDadLab #codingforkids #legoboost\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "In this simple presentation, we see how siphons work. I asked Alex and Max to pay attention and tell me at what level should be water so that it starts going through the straw. So they did, had fun and learned something new.\nA siphon can lift the water up without a pump, and that is the reason it has been used for thousands of years. But even today it is not 100% clear why it works. Perhaps the challenge is there because a few processes are happening at the same time for siphons to work. On the one hand, air pressure pushes down on the water, so that it stays in a glass and cannot get anywhere else, but once we give it a way out, it takes it and goes through a straw. On the other hand, when a straw is filled with water, the lower part of the siphon weights more than the upper part. So like with scales, the force of gravity pulls the heavy side down taking the water through the tube. This process relies on the property of water to stick to itself, creating an unbroken chain of drops. Anyway, I hope it wasn't too much information, and you would find it as fascinating as I did\n#TheDadLab #physicsfun #homeschool #learnthroughplay\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "In this video, we cut a square hole, triangular hole, letter hole and a perfect star. Who knew that cutting holes in a piece of paper could be so fun and very educational. A fold&cut theorem states that any shape with straight sides can be cut out with a single cut if you fold a piece of paper the right way. So we started testing it. I asked Alex to make a square hole in the paper, and he made one with three cuts. Then I asked him to cut the same hole but cut only twice, and he made that happen too. Needless to say, he then found a way to cut a square hole with only one cut. After that, we started playing with other shapes too. The coolest thing was that we found a way to cut some letters too. \"L\" was a simple one. Some letters were tricky to find the solution. \nAnyway, I would like to challenge you to play with this theorem and share your cut-outs. This is a full family challenge, and I promise that everyone will have fun!\n#TheDadLab #boredinthehouse #togetherathome #kidscrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "There are different types of electricity, and today we are showing you five simple experiments with static electricity you could do at home. We see static electricity around us quite often, and it even builds on us. When we rub our feet on the carpet, we build up static electricity on the surface of our skin. It could make pieces of paper to stick to our feet or even zap something when we touch it. Did you know that lightning is also static electricity? The temperature of a lightning bolt is about 27,700 degrees Celsius (50000\u00b0F) that is five times hotter than the temperature of the surface of the Sun! If you rub a balloon on your hair, electrons are transferred from your hair to the balloon. This process gives the balloon a negative charge, and your hairs are left with a positive one. Almost like with a magnet, opposite charges will attract each other, and similar charges will repel.\nI hope you get inspired to try some of these experiments. If you do try them, please tell me how it went.\n#TheDadLab #science #learningthroughplay #homeschooling\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

It does not matter if you are in quarantine or lockdown, you can easily make these Fathers Day cards for your dad\n\nPop Up Loud - You can get as detailed as much as you like. I took the extra time to cut out my letters and colour in \u2018DAD\u2019. Do whatever you like! The pop-up effect will make this card extra special. Make sure you really make your crease lines nice and crips for the pop up to work.\n\nPull my Finger - This one gets a little complicated with all the folding, so be sure to take it as slow as you need. Make sure not to fold up your photo once it\u2019s in there; we want that part to stay nice. \n\nYou Make My Heart Pop - If you aren\u2019t sure how to print your photo into a heart, you can always print it and then cut it into shape. For this effect, be sure to angle only half of the pop-up tab, the half that connects to the heart.\n\nSuper Dad - This one is straightforward! Be sure to glue the smaller square inside, and the effect will work its magic. \n\nDapper Dad - For the surprise inside, try and make sure the words aren\u2019t already peaking through the shirt!\n\n#TheDadLab #fathersdaycards #fathersdaygift\n\n\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Take your time with the curls; it just makes the final result that much cuter.\u2800\n\u2800\n\ud83c\udf88Wind Machines - Thicker tabs will catch the wind easier, I made about 10. The paper straw should be thick enough to hold the cup!\u2800\n\u2800\n\ud83c\udf88Leaping Frog - The knots in the rubber band can be tricky, try and pull them as tight as you can.\u2800\n\u2800\n\ud83c\udf88Express Yourself- Just be sure to line up your faces when drawing them!\u2800\n\u2800\n\ud83c\udf88Spinning Tops - When applying the blue tac, make sure its evenly on there, so the top doesn\u2019t fall over.\u2800\n\u2800\n#TheDadLab. #quickcraft #justforkids #kidscrafts #papercrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "2 Amazing Hot and Cold Water Density Experiments\nThe science will amaze you if you just look close enough to things that surround you. What do you think would happen if you put hot and cold water in one container without mixing? Would \"hot-air-balloon\" principle work underwater where we heat water instead of air? We have done two cool experiments to answer those questions.\nWater changes density depending on the temperature. So much so that cold water would not mix with hot water if you place it carefully in one container. The molecules in hot water are excited by the energy, and they move faster. So when they bump into one another, they bounce further away, leaving big gaps. This means that now the same volume of water has fewer molecules and weights less. The opposite happens with cold water making its density a bit higher.\nAlthough the density difference is not that great, we can still see how hot water floats at the top while cold water stays at the bottom in our experiments. And this slight density difference has a significant impact on natural phenomena such as ocean currents.\n#TheDadLab #scienceforkids #parenthood #homeschooling\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Do you know how to keep ice for longer? Today we are exploring what materials delay melting of the ice better. The fact that clothes keep us warm confuses some children in thinking that the more materials we wrap around an ice cube, the hotter it is going to get inside. So make sure you ask children what they think is going to happen with the ice before going to the second part of the experiment.\n\nWe used: \n- six ice cubes \n- a glass container with lid\n- a cup \n- one piece of each material: fabric, paper, kitchen foil, plastic\n- a few rubber bands\n\nWe placed one ice cube in a cup. It should show us how fast ice melts naturally without any protection. So we could compare all other ice cubes to this one and see how good the material protects the ice. Then we used different materials to wrap all other ice cubes using rubber bands to hold the protective layer in place.\nWe waited for 2 hours before continuing our experiment. I was secretly looking at the ice cube in a cup to determine how long we need to wait. Ideally, this ice cube should be noticeably melted, so it is easier to compare with other ice cubes.\nSo when we unwrapped all ice cubes, we noticed that the fabric had done an excellent job.\nWe learned how different materials conduct heat. Metal (aluminium foil) is a good conductor of heat; that is why this material is used in making pans and pots. Metal quickly moves the heat from the flame to our food. Fabric isn't a good conductor of heat. That's why it's used to make blankets that keep us warm at night.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "To get children excited about learning, we need to make it fun! Here are five simple brain teasers and games you can make at home for your children.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55\ufe0f Use clear lids and coloured paper to make a brainteaser to play using logic and spatial awareness. First, glue different shapes each different colour to every lid. Then stack a few lids at the time creating unique shapes combinations. Make cards with these combinations, and you are ready to go!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55\ufe0f Cut out three arrows and attach them to a paper plate with paper fasteners. Create cards drawing arrows pointing in different directions. Give the game to your children, and they would need to match directions of arrows on the paper plate to the ones on the cards by rotating arrows. For older children, you can replace arrows on the cards with directions: north, east, south, and west.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55\ufe0f Cotton buds could be used to create brainteasers too. Colour each side with a different colour and create cards showing cotton buds, forming a unique shape. Children will need to find matching cotton buds to make a shape on a card matching all the colours at the same time.\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55\ufe0f Do you have plenty of empty boxes? It is time to make a fun toy from them. Get five identical squares and cut out four small squares from one of them. Cut out identical small squares in the same location on the next cardboard pieces but reduce the number of holes by one every time. Layer cardboard pieces together, glueing small squares on top of each other. Don't forget to colour the toy with markers!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55\ufe0f Cut out colourful fish from paper and attach a paperclip where the mouth is. Use a marker to draw numbers on each fish. Make a fishing rod with a magnet and start fishing out fish in numeric order.\u2800\n\u2800\n#TheDadLab #TogetheratHome #toddleractivities #kidsactivities #playandlearn\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "I take millions of photos, forget hundreds of thousands of them, but I do print the best ones. There is just something about holding a finished framed photo that is much more satisfying than seeing the photo on a pocket-sized screen. This time I decided to do a special 3D photo-project. I chose a photo that could be easily divided into background, foreground and one layer in between. Then I printed three copies of the same photo. I cut out each layer. For the next step, I used adhesive foam dots to stick layers together and to attach the final photo to the frame. The result is just magical! This technique makes a picture to literally pop-out of the frame. In real life, the effect looks even better than in the video. So I hope you will find time to make your 3D photo print like this for yourself or as a gift for someone special.\n#TheDadLab\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Let\u2019s play with some water and explore some of its weird scientific properties. Children are going to love these water tricks and will definitely want to learn how they work!\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Let\u2019s explore some things that float on the surface of the water. Using a trap of water, you can show you paper clips easily float instead of sinking. Then, you can cut out a fun Dino friend but folding apiece of paper in half and cutting out some fun shapes. Make sure he has his 6 feet sticking out! When he\u2019s ready, he\u2019ll float on top of the water too.\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Did you know some things are afraid of water? Some things, like cinnamon, are hydrophobic. Gently tap a tablespoon of water onto a glass of water, having it float on top. When you stick your finger in, the cinnamon won\u2019t get wet, and won\u2019t stick to your finger!\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Cut a small square of paper, and fold it three times on the diagonal. Cut the widest part into a pedal shape. Unfold and add a yellow dot, and you have a flower. Fold all the pedals towards the centre. Make as many as you like. When you put them into the water, the flowers open up when they start to absorb the water! \n\n\u2b55\ufe0f This one is pretty magical. Draw a mouth, and be sure to colour in those teeth. Put your paper into a plastic bag, and only trace black lines. When you place the plastic bag into a cup of water and look down into it, the teeth marks have disappeared!\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Fill a plastic bag with water. Then, take some super sharp pencils and push them all the way through both sides of the bag. No water will spill! Pretty neat. \n\n#TheDadLab #science #kidsscience #simpleexperiments\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Who doesn't like to dive in into the science of sound by creating a fun musical instrument your children could play with? To create a sound, you need to create a vibration. In this experiment, when you blow the air, you make the column of air inside the bottom part of the straw to vibrate. But when you submerge the straw into water, you reduce the volume of vibrating air, and that affects the pitch of sound waves. It could be noisy but remember you are doing it for science (: Have a good weekend!\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiments #familyfun\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "DIY Christmas Decorations! Even over the holidays, I try to bring in some science! I thought since we wanted a nice big Christmas star, we could make one with some DIY skills and simple science. For the star, I cut five sticks that are similar down to the same height. Then, we lined them up in a line. To tie them together, we started off using rubber bands and connecting them in a zig-zag pattern, like a really long \u2018Z\u2019. This is the best time to put on the string lights. Wind them all the way down the sticks. Now, you can carefully fold your star shape! Tie it off one last time to keep it together.\n\nThis was an enjoyable and easy Christmas activity to do, and I love the way this looks. It\u2019s easy thanks to the tension of the rubber bands holding this whole project together. Something so simple can make something so beautiful!\n#DIYChristmasDecorations\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

It can grow with your children because you can put in any numbers you want.  Let me know if you make this addition machine!\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Gift Box style Cardboard Box ( the lid should fold over the top and front)\n- Box cutter\n- Two Paper Cups\n- Pencil\n- Two Colored Paper Squares\n- Marker\n- Tape\n- Dry Erase Marker\n- Pom Poms, paper scrunched into balls or any small soft objects\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\u2800\n(1) Take your box and cut the top portion of the lid in half. Remove the half of the lid that's attached to the front, and put it aside. We'll need it for later.\n(2) Turn the box, so the section we just cut is now the front. This makes the back of the box the new top. On this new top, trace two circles with the bottom of your paper cups, and use the box cutter to cut the circles out. \n(3) Cut our the bottoms of the paper cups, and place them into the holes. \n(4) Take the portion of the box we cut off and put in into the cut hole, making a lip to catch the balls and make it easier to take them out. \n(5) On the coloured paper, write an addition sign on one, and then an equal sign on the other. Tape the \"plus\" sign on the outside near the cups and the \"equal\" sign near the inside bottom. \n(6) Cut two squares of wide tape, and place them on both sides of the plus sign.\n(7) Write in the numbers with a dry-erase marker\n(8) Now use the machine to find the answer!

      "description": "Try it only with adults supervision!!!\nFor today's experiment, we will explore the science of fire and learn some fire safety along the way. \nFor this, you'll need tea lights, different sized blocks, and a glass jar that can cover all of these items. When we put the jar over the lit flames, candles go out one by one, from tallest to shortest. Why is that? \nJust like us, fire needs air to breathe. When we put the candles in a jar, we aren't letting any new air in. Fire breathes in the air and lets out smoke. The smoke rises towards the top of the jar. The fire keeps breathing the air until smoke fills the jar from top to bottom. Fire can't breathe smoke, so the flame goes out once the air is gone. \nThis is why we are taught that in a fire emergency, we need to crawl towards the exit- that's where all the air is!\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "I do not want my kids to miss out on trick-or-treating this year, but I want to keep them safe. So this year we are trick-or-treating in our garden. It is like a candy treasure hunt. Children will have fun and get their long-waited candy.\n\nSimple Ideas for Halloween 2020: A Spooky, GLOW-Tastic Twist on Traditional Trick or Treating!!\n\nCan't trick or treat the conventional way due to the pandemic? No worries!! I am determined not to let Covid-19 ruin your first fall holiday. \n\nWith all the social distancing, we need to find a safe way to celebrate, for sure. By staying cautious and exceptionally creative, we can altogether rejoice Quarantine-o-ween. So, I'm here to show you a Halloween Hunt that you won't want to miss! \n\nComposing a candy hunt at home will enchant your kids without risking their safety or the wellbeing of others. Read on how to innovate traditional Trick-Or-Treat with a \"Candy Treasure Hunt\" without leaving your home or backyard. \n\n- Go DIY, buy your kids favourite candies and glue them inside paper cups using tape. Put each paper cup with candy upside down in the garden.\n- Another great way is to put the sweets inside biodegradable balloons and blow them up. To make it more fun, put LED tea light candles inside the balloons for a glow in the dark Halloween hunt experience.\n- Finally, channel your decorating soul and celebrate Halloween with pumpkins and lights, and other creepy sights. Crave and fill up the pumpkin with delicious candies and treats for the sweetest surprise for your little ones.\n\nNow that the garden has been set-up with the balloons, pumpkins, ghoulish cups, and lights, are you ready for some Halloween fun? Wait for it to get darker, then invite your kids to invade the treasure hunt! Let them wrap up sweets and prizes into individual buckets. Kids will be spotting stuff glowing in the grass, and it would feed the excitement.\n\nSo, let's get creative and take Halloween fun to a whole new level. It would be great to fuse these simple ideas into our usual yearly Halloween tradition. Let's make it spooky as always but keeping everybody safe during these uncertain times.\n\nHappy Halloween kids activity!\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

With the project, you\u2019ll be able to turn your paper bag into any kind of trees you like. I was going for more of an apple tree. Please let me know if it looks like one (:\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Paper bag\u2800\n- Leaves\u2800\n- Glue stick\u2800\n- Scissors\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\u2800\n(1) Fold up a paper bag. You\u2019ll want to cut a lot of medium-sized slits, about 2cm each. The cuts should go about 2/3rds of the way down the bag. Be sure to cut through both sides of the paper. These are your tabs.\u2800\n(2) Open the bag up, and start gathering all the tabs together at the base. Squeeze them together really tight! When they\u2019re close together, start to twist from the base of all the tabs upward gently. \u2800\n(3) Taking 2 or 3 tabs at a time, twist them together to make tree branches. Leave the last third of the branch and just twist out the singular tabs. These make some skinnier branches. \u2800\n(4) Glue the leaves to the ends of the twisted branches. \u2800\nOur tree sculpture is complete!\u2800\n#TheDadLab #kidscrafts #fallcrafts #autumncrafts #naturecrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Let's craft a cute hippo toy! By changing the tension on the string, we can open the mouth of our hungry hippo a little for a small snack, or huge for a great big dinner! You can take the idea further and use this technique to create other animals. What animal is your child's favourite? \n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Paper cups\n- Coloured paper \n- String\n- Glue\n- Pencil\n- Scissors\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) On the first paper cup, we're going to want the cup to be able to fold in half. To achieve this, draw two vertical lines on either side of the paper cup. The lines should touch the bottom, but not the top rim. \n(2) Using these lines, make two semi-circles so that they're joined together. It should look like you have two 'U's that are connected. On the bottom of the cup, draw a small circle near the top of a 'U' that you string could pass through.\n(3) Cut out around the 'U's, be sure to also cut on those vertical lines. Cut out or pierce the hole on the bottom. Gently fold the bottom. \n(4) Cut out and glue on a tongue, eyes, teeth and ears. \n(5) Take a string, and thread it through the hole. Glue it to the top of your hippo's mouth. That's the head!\n(6) On your second paper cup, draw a triangle on the bottom of the cup that touches all the sides. Draw a small circle near the top rim on the side. Cut these out.\n(7) Thread the string through the triangle, and then through the hole. Tie it off and add a paper tab. Glue the head into the triangle hole. Your puppet is done!\n#TheDadLab #diytoys #familyfun #letscraft #homeschool #mechanicalengineering\n\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

It works with a rubber band, that when twisted and released, makes our propeller go and fly our helicopter across the floor. \n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- 2 paper cups\n- Coloured paper\n- Marker\n- Bead\n- Twist Tie\n- Paper straw\n- Scissors\n- Glue\n- Pencil\n- Rubber band\n- Skewer\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Take one paper cup and cut it in half vertically. Take one of these halves and cut off the rim. Crease it in half, so your longest sides are touching. You should have a sort of tube shape.\n(2) With another paper cup, bottom side up, draw a large oval near the rim. Cut it out. Put your tube in this hole. It should look like a teapot, or watering can.\n(3) Decorate helicopter with coloured paper or markers.\n(4) On the top, pierce a hole in the centre. Loop the rubber band around itself to tie it to the centre of the skewer. Thread a bead onto the rubber band. \n(5) Thread the rubber band through the cup, so that the bead and skewer are on top, and the band is inside. Stretch the band, and using the twist tie, attach the band to the straw.\n(6) Attach your propeller blades. Now, after you twist the straw on the bottom and release it, your top propeller will spin!\n\n#TheDadLab #playandlearn #montessorikids #learningthroughplay #preschool #homeschooling #papercrafts #craftsforkids\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Holiday time, when we gather around the fire with friends and family, and maybe exchange a gift or two. This year might look different for a lot of people around the world. It really got me thinking about what my holidays were like as a child. The toys definitely weren't super technical like they are today! I wanted to share a little bit of these analogue holiday memories with you, and I came up with a make-shift pinball machine. Did you have a toy like this growing up?\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Cardboard\n- Wooden clothespin\n- Wooden popsicle stick\n- Coloured paper\n- Plastic or rubber ball\n- Boxcutter\n- Hot glue gun\n- Marker\n- Glue\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Take a large piece of cardboard, and cut it according to the picture.\n(2) Using the hot glue gun, glue the smaller cut piece to the largest piece, like you're building a gingerbread house.\n(3) Glue the popsicle stick onto the top of the clothespin. Then, glue the opposite side on the clothespin to the bottom of our cardboard shape, placing it in the corner.\n(4) Taking additional thin strips of cardboard, glue them to the interior of the large cardboard shape according to the video. You should have a think \"alleyway\" and three U-shapes.\n(5) Cut triangle shapes and rectangles out of the colourful paper, labelling the rectangles as 20, 15, 10, and then \"Pinball\". Glue the sign at the top, the points in the 'U\u2019-shapes, and the triangles pointing up in the alleyway.\n(6) Tilt your pinball machine. When you put down the popsicle stick and release it, it flings the ball up the alleyway and into the points area!\n\n#TheDadLab #repurpose #kidsactivities #preschoolplay #diycrafts #diytoys #diycardboardplay #cardboardart #ideasforcardboard #cardboardcraft #recycleandplay #cardboardbox #cardboard\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Do you know the difference between an alligator and a crocodile? The easiest difference to spot is their snouts! Crocodiles have V-shaped snouts and interlocking teeth. When crocodiles close their mouth, you can see both upper and lower teeth. Alligators, on the other side, have U-shaped snouts, and they show only upper teeth when their mouth is closed. Which one are you going to make with me today? Let me know!\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Paper cups\n- Coloured paper\n- Scissors\n- Glue\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Cut 4 horizontal cuts into the side of a paper cup. Then, cut the bottom out. Carefully cut the strip second from the bottom and the one closes to the top rim in half. Push these tabs out, and crease them towards the ends to make legs.\n(2) Cut out two spikes pieces of paper and a long trapezoid shape. Make it pointy to rounded to decide if you\u2019re going to make a crocodile or an alligator! Glue the spikes shapes onto the long sides of the trapezoid. Push your slides up to make teeth. Do this again, so you have a top and bottom set.\n(3) Glue these to the inside of the bottom of the cup to make your mouth. (4) Cut out and glue on a tongue that comes out the back of the cup. Cut out a strip and attach to the roof of the mouth, and have it also come all the way out the back. Attach these pieces together.\n(5) Cut out eyes, spine pieces, and a tail cover, and glue these on.\n(6) Pull the tail and watch him bite!\n#TheDadLab #playandlearn #montessori #learningthroughplay #preschool #homeschool #papercrafts #diytoys\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Add glue to the 4th folded panel. Then, fold the paper into a box, leaving the 5th panel for out - like a tiny hat. Cut this panel off. \n(2) Taking that panel, cut it into two large tab shapes that will support Santas head and legs, and two smaller ones to support his arms. See how it already starts to wiggle when you move the rectangle back and forth?\n(3) Taking more paper, cut out and draw out Santas features.

Salt dissolves in water and lowers its freezing point, so it takes temperature to drop even lower to turn salted water into ice. Our picture today will use salt, and watercolour paints too.\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Colour paper\n- PVA glue\n- Salt\n- Watercolour paints\n- Water\n- Brush\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS: \n(1) Create your design with glue on the paper. Cover the glue with salt and let dry.\n(2) Use water to activate the paints, and lightly dab them onto the salt.

      "description": "How to Make a Ball Sorting Machine | DIY Cardboard Games for Toddlers\nThere is a big chance we all have an abundance of empty cardboard boxes after Christmas. Let's turn them into toys! There is no such thing as \"too many toys\" is there? (: Here is a simple DIY ball sorter that will help you sort all the balls you have at home by size while keeping your child entertained and curious about how this mysterious machine works.\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Cardboard box\n- Craft paper\n- Rubber Balls (Three different sizes)\n- Scissors \n- Marker\n- Glue\n- Paperclip\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Cut an empty cardboard box to make shapes I show in the video. Glue them together so that it looks almost like the bottom of a vending machine. \n(2) On a smaller piece of cardboard that will fit inside the box, make holes that will easily have the two smaller sizes of rubber balls through them. One box for each size. \n(3) Glue this slotted piece inside the box at an angle, adding two divider pieces so there are three slots. \n(4) Score the excess piece of cardboard at the back of the box and fold it down to make a lid. Mark out and cut out a hole at the top where you ramp is. Cover the top half of the exposed part with a piece of paper with three different sized dots, matching your balls.\n(5) When you drop your balls, watch how they get sorted in different sections!\n\n#TheDadLab #cardboardbox #earlylearning #learningthroughplay #playbasedlearning #cardboardcraft #cardboard #earlylearning #everydayplayhacks #montessoriactivity #playathome #busytoddler #recycleandplay #toddleractivities \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "[#AD] We have discovered a new powerful way to give our children a chance to make a real change in saving the planet! It's called @LEGO Build the Change, and it is accessible for everyone for free - just click the link in my profile. Children are learning about the environment and doing warm-up challenges creating wild animals and crafting their habitats. Everything leads to the Big Challange that children need to solve using any creative materials they have. You do not need to own LEGO bricks to take part. The experience took about one hour for us to complete. We had a fantastic time learning, playing and using our imagination to develop solutions to real-world environmental problems.\n#TheDadLab #BuildtheChange @LEGOFoundation #Changemaker #LearningthroughPlay #Biodiversity #ClimateChange #STEAM #LEGO #LegoFoundation\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Did you like playing with a dollhouse growing up? Here is a paper one that children can quickly make on their own! This playhouse can be designed in any way they\u2019d like to suit any figurines they already have. After children are done playing, the house could be easily folded for compact storage. \n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Craft paper\n- Scissors \n- Marker\n- Glue\n- Paperclip\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Take a paper square and fold it half one way, then in half the other way, so it\u2019s like there\u2019s a plus sign in the paper. Cut one of the pluses legs to the centre. You should have two tabs that are still connected to the paper. \n(2) In the top left square, draw a door. In the bottom left square, draw a path. In the top right square, draw a window. Put glue on the bottom right square. Place the bottom left corner on the top right, so it makes half a 3-D box. Fold the bottom path in the middle towards the centre, and fold the whole thing in half, so it appears to be one square.\n(3)  Repeat step 2, but with 3 other rooms of the house. Glue the \u201cwalls\u201d together, leaving one pair unglued. Paperclip this wall together. \n(4) Cut out details.\n(5) Fold up your house and take it anywhere you\u2019d like!\n#TheDadLab #earlylearning #learnthroughplay #montessoriactivity #playathome #busytoddler #recycleandplay #toddleractivity\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

We can see this effect in a similar way when we make a paper chain!\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Craft paper\n- Marker\n- Scissors\u2800\n- Glue\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Cut out several strips of paper in two different colours. Stack them up, and cut them in half. Take one colour, and with glue, connect it to make your first loop. Take the second colour, and loop it through the first loop, and glue it shut to start your paper chain. I made mine 16 links long. \n(2) Cut out snake's head with a tongue, glue on or draw on eyes. Glue to your last link.

This fun robot activity helps children to practice cutting along the lines and while switching directions. The skills used for this task are essential for those needed to complete everyday tasks. So, whether you have your very own robot for daily chores or not, this activity is will help guide the way. You never know, maybe one day your child could be using these to build their very own robot!\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Paper / card\n- Marker\n- Stickers (here we have used robot stickers)\n- Scissors\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Cut strips of card or paper, big enough for your child to hold.\n(2) Using one strip of paper, place a sticker at the top of one side.\n(3) Draw dashed lines using the pen. For beginners, draw a straight line from the sticker to the bottom of the paper. To adapt this, you can draw lines that curve or zigzag.\n(4) Taking your scissors, place another small sticker (we used a robots arm) on top of the straight blade. When you begin cutting it should look like your scissors are trying to catch the sticker at the end of the line.\n(5) Now let your children use the scissors to catch the robot!\n\n#TheDadLab #preschool #preschoolteacher #preschoolactivities #preschoollearning #preschoolmom \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

This is a scrolling game where you have to fly your spaceship by avoiding crashing it into asteroids, dwarf planets and perhaps some flying saucers. Ready, set, launch!\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Cardboard\n- 2 pencil\n- 2 wooden skewers\n- Plastic caps from plastic bottles\n- Long strip of paper with a space background \n- Paper spaceship\n- String\n- Scissors or box cutter\n- Hot glue gun\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Cut out a large piece of cardboard using the video as reference. The four corners should be small rectangles, and the sides should be long rectangles. Glue the long pieces to the edges of the largest uncut piece to make a box. \n(2) Take a pencil and pierce it through 2 of the smaller pieces of cardboard. Put hot glue around the pencil between the two pieces. Hot glue the cardboard to the inside of the box. Repeat with one more pencil and other two cardboard pieces.\n(3) Repeat step 2 with wooden skewers, but do not add hot glue around them. On one skewer, piece the centre of the bottle cap and put it in the centre of the skewer. Put another pierced cap on the exposed end of the lower pencil. \n(4) Tie the string in a loop around the wooden skewer, making sure it goes around the bottle cap. \n(5) Loop the strip of paper around the coloured pencils and glue it shut. \n(6) Glue a spaceship to the string, pointing up to the pencils.

      "description": "This craft is meant for a child and a parent to enjoy making together. How strong are your origami skills? Let's start with something simple to find out! Fold a paper crane and add colourful feathers to it!\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Craft paper\n- Marker\n- Scissors\u2800\n- Glue\n\u2800\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Take several thin strips of paper in different colours. Each strip should be slightly shorter than the last. Taking the shortest one, make a loop and glue it shut. Taking the next shortest piece, glue one end to the loop, and then glue the detached end to the top, making a slightly longer loop that is over the first. Repeat with all your strips. I did four colours and made six total loops of varying sizes.\n(2) Taking a square of paper, fold it on a diagonal to make a triangle, with the longest side being the crease. Take the top of the paper, the part that's not attached to anything, and fold it down and off to the side, so the left edge is now flush with the bottom edge. Repeat on the other side.\n(3) Repeat step two but with these smaller triangles. Open up the shape one time. Then start to fold it towards the centre, then crease it down. It makes a sort of fortune cookie type of shape. Make sure to crease everything down nice and firm. \n(4) Open up the top of one triangle tip, and bend it to make a head. Cut off the tip of the other triangle. Sit down the bird and let it open up on its own. \n(5) Take the larger loops and glue them together with hot glue. Insert them into the cut end to make the tail. Take the two smaller pieces and glue them towards the centre of the bird to make the wings. \n#TheDadLab #letscraft #papercrafts #kidscrafts #craftsforkids #simplecrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Let's use apples to check our math! This educational craft for math activity clearly shows the representation of addition, and it makes finding results fun for children.\u2800\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Coloured paper\u2800\n- Pencil\u2800\n- Scissors\u2800\n- Glue\u2800\n- Ruler\u2800\n- Box Cutter\u2800\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\u2800\n(1) Draw a top of a tree and the trunk. Cut out the shapes with the scissors.\u2800\n(2) Glue down the leaves onto the plain white piece of paper.\u2800\n(3) Draw a 2cm vertical line on the bottom left of the tree trunk. Go up a centimetre, and draw another line. Repeat again, so you have 3 lines on the left. Repeat on the right. You should have 6 lines in total, 3 sets of 2. \u2800\n(4) On a surface that's safe to cut on, use the box cutter to cut out the lines. Glue down only the top third of the tree trunk. \u2800\n(5) Taking the strips of paper, thread them through the notches we made, so the paper strip peaks through the middle of our trunk. Be sure to crease the ends to make tabs, so they don't slide out! \u2800\n(6) Glue 1cm paper squares of paper onto the trunk, in-between our sliding ones. Write \"+\" on one, and then \"=\" sign on the other.\u2800\n(7) Using the pull tabs, write the number 1-5 on the top two sliders, and then 1-10 on the bottom one. \u2800\n(8) Cut the red paper into 10 small circular apples for your tree. As you do the math, you can add apples to the tree and count them!\u2800\n#TheDadLab #playandlearn #preschool #montessoriathome #montessorikids #learningthroughplay #learningisfun #preschoolteacher #preschoolactivities #preschooler #kindergarten #homeschool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Valentine's day is just around the corner, and this little heart garland is a great way to fuel your kids' imagination. Teach your kids the wonder of science with this heart experiment and watch their love of science grow. Learning through play is fun and a great way to share learning and science with your little ones. This activity shows how salt interacts with ice to fuse the string and helps children understand science through play.\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Glass of water\u2800\n- Red food colouring\n- Heart-shaped ice tray\n- Plate or tray\n- String that can absorb water\n- Salt\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\u2800\n(1) Add a few drops of red food colour to a glass of water and mix\u2800\n(2) Transfer water to the heart-shaped ice tray.\u2800\n(3) Put the ice tray in a freezer until the water is completely frozen \u2800\n(4) Take ice hearts out and place them in a row on a plate.\n(5) Soak string in water thoroughly\n(6) Lay the string over the row of ice hearts\n(7) Add a pinch of salt to each heart where the string and the ice meet\n(8) Wait 5 seconds and then lift the string to see how it fused with ice hearts.\n\n\u2b55 SCIENCE EXPLANATION\nWhat happens here is that salt dissolves in a thin layer of water the ice has. Salty water has a lower freezing temperature than fresh water, so it makes ice to melt, absorbing the heat in the process. Ice takes some of that heat from water causing water to freeze back again trapping our string.\n#TheDadLab #scienceiscool #scienceexperiment #scienceteacher #valentines #happyvalentinesday #valentineday #myvalentine #happyvalentine\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Using hearts to keep it Valentine-themed is a fantastic way to get your kids interested in science and art. Fuel their imagination, creativity and love of science with a colourful baking soda heart eruption. This experiment is fun for parents and kids and will fuel their love of learning and curiosity.\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\u2800\n- Baking soda\u2800\n- Different shades of food colouring\n- Water\n- Heart-shaped ice tray\n- Vinegar\n- Hand wash\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\u2800\n(1) Add a few drops of food colouring to baking soda, add a little bit water and mix\n(2) Repeat with different colours.\u2800\n(3) Add the mixtures to a heart ice tray\u2800\n(4) Freeze until solid\n(5) Lay them out in a deep bowl\n(6) Add hand wash to vinegar and mix\n(7) Pour the mixture over the hearts and watch them fizz\n(8) Mix up the foam to create colourful art\n\n\u2b55 SCIENCE EXPLANATION\nWhen we mix vinegar and baking soda, they react and produce a gas - carbon dioxide. We added soap into the mix. So the gas blows bubbles, creating a lot of foam.\n#TheDadLab #scienceiscool #scienceexperiment #scienceexperiment #valentines #happyvalentinesday #valentineday #myvalentine #happyvalentine #preschool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "When a lion flaunts its mane, it shows he is ready to rule the pride. So if your lion's hair is in need of a tame, this activity will help turn him from a little cub to a powerful bit cat. It is a great activity for children who are confident in using scissors but still want to challenge their skills. It encourages lots of practice and focus as they cut the lines in a range of different directions. Now let's get those mane's fit for a king!\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- Paper /card (in a selection of colours)\n- Marker\n- Glue\n- Scissors\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) On a small piece of a yellow card, use your marker to draw the outline of a lion's head and cut it out.\n(2) Draw on a lion's face\n(3) Turning your lion's face on to its front, use your glue to stick strips of multicoloured paper all around to make its mane.\n(4) Turn your lion back over. On each strip of paper, draw different lines to indicate where to cut - you can draw lines that are straight, curved, zigzag, vertical, horizontal and as many as you like.\n(5) Once completed, your children can use the scissors to trim and tame the lion's mane, just in time to rule over the pride. \n\n#TheDadLab #preschool #kindergarten #montessoriathome #preschoolactivities #earlylearning #montessorikids #learningathome\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "We all fear hearing the *snip snip* of children using scissors. Was it their hair? My curtains? The beloved teddy bear\u2019s head? Learning how to use scissors takes lots of practice, but it is essential. The skills used are the same ones as when completing daily activities and writing. But simply asking children to cut out worksheet after worksheet, instead of our home decor, could get quite boring. Here are 5 activities that are perfect for both child and parent.

That is a cool experiment on its own, but let's focus on density here. After we moved the card that separated glasses a little bit to create a small gap for liquids to connect, water and oil started moving. In the end, we had oil in the top glass and water in the bottom glass. It was time to turn our structure upside down and watch the flow of these liquids again. It can continue forever as long as you continue flipping glasses. But then we tried the same experiment with four liquids: water, coloured rubbing alcohol, handwash and oil.\n#TheDadLab #kidsactivities #kidsscience #scienceexperiment #scienceforkids #stemforkids #physicslovers #scienceteacher\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "This saltwater density tower experiment will help you and your children understand density better. Density is the mass of a material per unit volume, and it is a fixed number for each material. The density of water is 997 kg/m\u00b3; however, we can increase it by adding salt and sugar to it. In this experiment, we were adding a different amount of salt to each glass of water. When the salt dissolves, it increases the mass of water without changing the volume very much, which means that the saltwater solution's density becomes higher than freshwater. That is why we could make this beautiful salt density tower.\nJust a word of caution, when you are pouring colourful salty water into a big jar, you need to be very careful. Otherwise, you will end up with a jar full of salty brown water. Make sure you use small pieces of paper and funnel with a paper straw, as we show in the video.\n#TheDadLab #kidsscience #scienceexperiments #scienceforkids #stemforkids #physicslovers #scienceisfun #density \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Let\u2019s make 5 Amazing DIY Toys with a dash of science that your kids will surely love!\n\n00:03 - Velcro Dot Craft Sticks (Popsicles)\n\nMaterials: \nCraft Sticks (Popsicle Sticks) Depending on your choice of color and size andPieces\nVelcro dots ( Depending on your desired pieces/pack) You can buy the Stick ready kind or the ones you can manually glue on.\n\nInstructions:\nAttach the velcro dots to every end of the popsicle sticks. Make sure to attach the same kind of dot on the same side and on the other side. The velcro dots stick very well and it doesn\u2019t come off easily even after months of playing with it. Remember to let the glue set the number of hours suggested on the packaging!\n\nHand them to the kids and watch them play. Show them how it works by demonstrating that the tabs stuck to each other before they can start making or forming their own popsicle stick projects.\n\n00:37- Easy Horn\n\nMaterials Needed:\nA piece of Unblown Balloon\nA piece of Rubber Band\nA piece of clean water bottle (unused or used be sure its clean! \ud83d\ude09)\nAnd a Cutter\n\nInstructions:\nCut the top part of the water bottle using the cutter (as shown in the video). Next is to cut a small part of the balloon in the mid section small enough to fit in the lip and in the collar part of the water bottle. Place the balloon in the lip and collar part of the water bottle and secure the opening (the part that has been cut) with the rubber band until tightened and Tada! You now have a handy-dandy horn! You can do it with other colors too!\n\n1:36- The Diving Ketchup\n\nMaterials Needed:\nEmpty and Clean water bottle\nA packet of ketchup\nWater-Plenty enough to fill the water bottle\n\nInstructions:\nIt is very important to select a ketchup packet that will float in water. Test a couple packets by placing them one by one in the glass of water. Choose the one that floats the highest at the surface of the water.\nRemove any labels on the plastic water bottle.\nFill the plastic water bottle with water, leaving about an inch of air at the top.\nFold the ketchup packet in half lengthwise and push it into the bottle. Double check that it floats.\nScrew the cap tightly back on to the bottle.\nNow, it's time to command the ketchup! Holding the bottle upright in one hand, squeeze the bottle gently. What happens to the ketchup packet? Now, release the pressure of your squeeze and watch what happens. By experimenting with the amount of pressure you apply to the bottle, can you make the packet levitate in the middle of the bottle?\nNow that you have mastered the ability to get the ketchup to sink, rise, and hover, find yourself an audience and get dramatic about it! Command the ketchup to move 'up', 'down', and to 'stop'. Your audience won't believe their eyes!\n\n2:20- Magic Sequins Sublimation\nMaterials Needed:\nCardboard Enough to fit the Sequin Pillow case.\n\nInstructions:\nPlace the cardboard in a sequin pillow case, close it, and Hand them to the kids and watch them play. Your kids will be amazed by the magic they see as they touch the pillow case!\n\n3:19- Empty Squeezy Rocket Launchers\nMaterials: \nEmpty Squeezy water bottles,\nCardboard,\nStraws,\nScissors,\nGlue/sellotape,\nBlue tack,\nPlasticine,\n\nInstructions:\nFOR THE BOTTLE\nLift up the sports cap and push in half a straw, seal around it with blu tack.\nSqueeze the bottle and make sure air is coming out of the top of the straw, not the sides.\nFOR THE ROCKET\nDraw and cut out a cardboard rocket.\nSeal one end of a larger straw than the one in the bottle with sellotape.\nAttach the rocket onto one side of the straw.\nPlace the rocket on the bottle and squeeze the bottle hard, the rocket should fly into the air.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube\n\n#TheDadLab  #kidsactivities #preschoolplay #diycrafts #diytoys #5MinuteToysforKidsCraft  #5MinuteCraftsWaterBottle  #HandicraftforKids  #handicraft #glue  #plasticine #sellotape",

      "description": "You'll have to try this fun kids science experiment to see what happens when you layer liquids of different densities. Making an impressive 8 Layer Density Tower Experiment requires an understanding of density. Let me explain a bit - to calculate a density of an object, you would measure its mass and divide it by its volume. Pretty easy, right?\nSo grab liquids from around the house and start pouring them into a glass; just make sure you do it gently and follow the correct order. If you do not have anything from the list, you can skip it.\n\u2b55 LIQUIDS ORDER FOR DENSITY TOWER:\u2800\n- Honey\n- Marple syrup\n- Milk\n- Hand soap\n- Water\n- Rubbing Alcohol\n- Vegetable oil\n- Baby oil\n\nHave you ever wondered about the density difference between liquids and solids? In this experiment, you will have a chance to explore that. After you poured eight layers of liquids, drop some objects in your glass and watch how deep they would go. Every object will get stuck at a level that has a similar density to its own. We tested steel screw, marbles, raisins, peanuts and ping pong ball.\n#TheDadLab #kidsscience #scienceexperiments #scienceforkids #stemforkids #physicslovers #scienceiscool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

We blew out the egg's insides through a small hole and let the eggshell sit in the vinegar for a day (it could take longer). We ended up with a naked egg membrane that looks like an egg, but you can actually fold it. If you bounce it from one hand to another, the membrane will suck in the air back and it again will look like an egg. This looks like a magic trick, doesn't it? In fact, I remember seeing a magician performing it once\n #TheDadLab #eggs #eastereggs #scienceexperiments #eggshell\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

It would be amazing to test this while swimming in the actual sea somewhere hot, but here we are doing it at home in a big bowl. If a poached egg is your thing, you probably have done this experiment before, but now ask your friends what shape they think the yolk is and let them play around with it in a jar full of water. \n#TheDadLab #eggs #eastereggs #scienceexperiment #distancelearning #homeschool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Have you ever wondered how magnets work?\nMagnetic fields exert force on other magnetic materials. This force is what causes the magnet to stick to the fridge or the magnet to stick to the paper clips.\nIn this magnetic field science experiment for kids, you will be able to see how these forces look and how magnetic field lines behave.\nIt is always fun to play with magnets. We added iron filings to a bottle of shampoo to see the magnetic field. If you move a magnet over the bottle and look closely, you notice the outline of magnetic force created by iron filings.\n#TheDadLab #scienceforkids\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "We are trying a fun way to find the centre of the mass of a ruler. If you hold your index fingers in front of you, put a ruler on top of them and start moving your hands towards each other, your fingers end up right at the unique point where the ruler's mass is centred. We added weight on one side to make it more challenging, and then we tried moving fingers at different speeds and placing fingers at the asymmetrical position. But every time we fingers meet right under the centre of the mass of the ruler. How does it work? The finger that is closer to the centre of the mass carries more weight and friction increases letting the other finger come closer. Then the same thing is happening with the second finger, which allows the first finger to slide.\n#TheDadLab #scienceisfun #scienceforkids\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "You probably know that by spinning an egg, you can find out if it is raw or hard-boiled. But did you know that if you stop a spinning raw egg for a second with your finger and release it, it continues spinning for a little bit? A raw egg has two main parts: a hard shell and the liquid inside. So when we start turning the egg, the inner part does not want to move, it resists that change, making it challenging to begin spinning the egg. The same thing is happening when we are stoping the egg: we are stoping the shell, and the liquid inside keeps on turning. This resistance to change of movement is called Inertia!\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiment #scienceforkids\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

But smooshing and squeezing slime looks like an enjoyable sensory activity with a splash of chemistry. So I searched for simple recipes of non-toxic slimes that make a minimum mess. This one is the first one we tried that is easy to make with ingredients we found at home: cornstarch, hand wash, body lotion and food colouring. The slime is stretchy and soft, but we could easily cut it and even spread it like butter.\nMore slime recipes will be coming soon.\n#TheDadLab #kidsactivities #slime #slimevideo #slimetutorial #slimerecipe #slimevideos #butterslime\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Adding food colouring is always a good idea to make the slime brighter. Then we added a bit of cornstarch to make the slime less sticky, and that was it.

      "description": "Do your kids love slime? Mine do now! I bet you've seen the trend going around of all these variations of homemade slime with the latest craze - magnetic slime.  My boys love magnetic slime because it's so much more interactive than regular slime. It's a great way to teach kids about magnetism while having fun at the same time. Magnetic slime is made by adding iron filings to any recipe of homemade gooey slimes. We made slime by mixing Elmer's (PVA) glue, shaving gel and liquid laundry detergent. But you can add iron filings to any recipe that worked for you. Some of you said that your liquid laundry detergent did not produce slime, which could be the case because different brands use different ingredients. Your best bet is to replace detergent with a contact lens solution. It is important to say that our \"magnetic slime\" is not magnetic by itself, which means it will not stick to metal things. But iron filings make it react to magnets, so you need a powerful magnet to enjoy this slime in full.\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiments #slime #slimevideo #slimetutorial #slimerecipe #magnetic\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "This experiment looks simple, but a lot of science is involved here. We are making a chemical reaction to change the combined density of our bottle with a balloon. That makes it float to the top with all the heavy weight of paperclips. \n\nWhat you need:\n\u2022 A small bottle\n\u2022 Paperclips and (small nuts or pebbles)\n\u2022 Baking Soda\n\u2022 Funnel (optional)\n\u2022 Teaspoon\n\u2022 Balloon\n\u2022 Vinegar\n\u2022 Pipette\n\u2022 Vase or tall glass\n\u2022 Water\nInstructions:\n1. Take a small bottle, fill it with some paper clips, small nuts or pebbles (high density\nmaterials), to make it heavy.\n2. Add half a teaspoon of baking soda into the bottle. You might need to use a small\nfunnel.\n3. Use a pipette to put about 3 squirts of vinegar into the balloon.\n4. Wrap the balloon around the lip of the bottle, but make sure\nthat the vinegar does not go into the bottle.\n5. Take a vase or tall glass and fill it with water.\n6. Carefully grab the bottle by the neck, making sure that the balloon0\nis hanging down by its side.\n7. Drop it into the water.\n8. What happens? Does the bottle go to the bottom? Does it stay there?\n\nThe Science Explained:\nThis experiment looks simple, but a lot of science is involved here. Can you see the bubbles? Those bubbles are filled with a gas called Carbon dioxide (CO\u2082), a substance that was created when we mixed the vinegar and baking soda. The combined density of the contraption we made is higher than that of the water, so it sinks to the bottom at first. After the chemical reaction takes place, created CO\u2082 decreases the density of\nthe contraption to a point lower than that of the water, so it floats to the top\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

It turns out that not all materials float on water! How does density come into play? Density is a measure of how tightly atoms are packed in a given material. The more tightly packed the atoms are, the higher the density of the material. Materials with high densities will have more mass per unit volume than those with low densities.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "How cool is this instant ice experiment? But let me be honest. This experiment looks simple, but it is not! The idea isn't new, and we wanted to try it for a while because we did not need a lot to make this experiment: just a bottle of water, an ice cube and a freezer. But what they usually fail to mention is that the most crucial ingredient for the project's success is patience! \nIt took us a few weeks to film this experiment!\nWhere do I start? Ok. So only clean bottled water from the shop would work. Unfortunately, you can't fill an empty plastic bottle with water if you want to experiment to work. \nThen you have to be very precise with the timing. For example, if you do not hold the bottle in the freezer for long enough, the water will not turn into ice when you pour it on top of an ice cube. But then again, a bit too long - and you end up with ice in the bottle. \nA piece of advice for those brave enough to take on the challenge, if your water bottle froze once, you cannot defrost it and use it again - the experiment will not work. We made that conclusion after quite a few tries.\nWhen you have done everything right, and you got a perfect almost iced water bottle, you have to be very careful not to shake it or bang it; otherwise, it will turn into ice all of a sudden. If you are pouring water into a glass, make sure the glass is spotlessly clean. A piece of dust could make water start turning into the ice.\nThat is it! It takes a lot of tries to make it work. I think this is a great experiment for older children who can go through the process of discovery independently. But if you are a parent or a teacher and want to show something cool quickly to children, this experiment has a low success rate of going right at your first try.\nAnyway, the experiment looks impressive, and even though it took us a while, I am happy we have tried it. \n#TheDadLab #playandlearn #kidsactivities #scienceexperiment #playbasedlearning #scienceiscool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Math is part of the STEAM system - Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics! It is essential to teach all five of them. And the best way to engage with children is to turn lessons into a game. Leave a comment down below which part of STEAM your children are the most excited about!\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Math can be a hands-on activity! When we make it more tactile, it makes it easier for kids to learn. Filling up rubber gloves with rice, we make a new set of hands that the kids can count on. This is a great way to introduce addition and counting because the answer is visual. It\u2019s also great for subtraction!\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Pin it Down. This addition game is a great start to doing sums in the head. All the answers are right there- you just have to do the work to find the right one! It\u2019s really satisfying when you pin the equation to the right answer.\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Math Garage. I love this addition game because it shows how many different answers there can be to the same question. This is great for kids that are active and love to solve puzzles, or just love cars!\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f Is it time to pick apples yet? This addition activity shows a whole math formula altogether. The apples on our math tree also help count, so you can double-check the answer you came up with. This one is also great for getting fast sums.\n\n\u2b55\ufe0f The Addition Machine. Do you like my addition machine? I find because you can write your own numbers, this one is the most versatile of the bunch.\n#TheDadLab #playandlearn #preschool #montessoriathome #montessorikids #learningthroughplay #learningisfun #preschoolteacher #preschoolactivities #preschooler #kindergarten #homeschool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "This Halloween, try the classic science experiment with the candle under a glass with a vampire twist! This simple spooky science experiment is perfect for the holiday season! If you little scientist asks why the vampire sucked all the blood (coloured water), here is a simple explanation.\nThe candle is heating the air inside the glass; it expands and gets out (you can see air bubbles when you place the glass in water). When the candle goes out, the air inside starts cooling down and shrink back to its original volume. Water blocks the way for air to come in, so air pressure outside pushes on it, causing it to go into the glass.\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiments #happyhalloween #halloweentime \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Luckily, there are some easy-to-do activities that will show the importance of brushing teeth to a child in a fun and interactive way. Here is just one example, put a picture of a smiling shark in a ziplock bag, draw dirty spots with dry erase markers, then give your children an old toothbrush so they can help the shark by brushing its teeth. \n#TheDadLab #brushyourteeth #playandlearn #babyshark\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "This experiment is designed to show the effects of different liquids on teeth. We used eggs because similar to teeth, eggshells contain calcium compounds. We prepared 4 glasses with 4 different liquids: cherry juice drink, vinegar, coffee and blackcurrant juice drink. We dropped four eggs into each glass and left them there for 24 hours to conduct the experiment. All drinks did not visibly damage eggs but coloured them into different colours. Later we tried to clean them using toothpaste, but you can still see some discolourization even after brushing. On the other hand, vinegar has weakened the shell, making it soft. No toothpaste will help to restore that effect!\nAnyway, we encourage you to try the same experiment with the drinks you have at home to see what effect they have on teeth (eggs) and we hope this would motivate more vigorous teeth brushing (:\n#TheDadLab #brushyourteeth #playandlearn #scienceexperiment\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

When we squeeze the bottle, we compress the air inside the straw. The air would keep the same mass, but now it would take up less volume, making it more dense, so the jellyfish sinks.\n\n#TheDadLab #kidsscience #scienceforkids\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Here is another fake viral science experiment that was floating online for a while. Can we really turn a glass upside down so that water stays in the glass? \nThis trick uses a bit of real science, making it harder to understand where the real science finishes and the fake one begins. \nAir molecules are constantly pushing into things creating a pressure of about 1 kg per square centimetre. That is enough pressure to hold a card under the water glass in place. The weight of water in my glass is only around 0.1 kg and there is no air pressure in the glass. So the upwards air pressure is much greater than the pressure of the water pushing down \u2013 keeping the water in the cup. In theory, water could stay in a glass even without a card. However, in practice, it's impossible to achieve. Water surface tension is not enough to stabilize the surface when the card is removed. A tiny ripple in the surface of the water makes the water pour down.\nThe secret of this demonstration is hiding in a special glass that you could get from any magician shop. \nThis glass makes this fake science experiment look cool, but this is just a magic trick - not science!\nThere you have it, another misleading science experiment!\nHit the follow to avoid being deceived again.\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiment #science\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Who would want to have millions of viruses and bacteria scattered around their bathroom? Not me! By a happy chance, it looks like there is a simple trick to check for microbes, and all you need is a phone with a flashlight and a bit of fake science. Viral videos claim that everyone can make blacklight by just colouring a flashlight with Sharpies. Blacklight is invisible to the human eye. But it can be absorbed by certain substances that contain phosphors, which convert ultraviolet light into glowing light. Body fluids are those substances as well as neon markers. This \"DIY blacklight\" does make neon markers glow in the dark, but just a little bit and only when you are very close. I could not make any microbes glow with it at all. When I used a real blacklight torch (you can see that clip at the very beginning of my video), all my marks were brightly glowing in the dark. All in all, this video includes a fake blacklight torch and fake viruses and bacteria.\nFollow for more exposed fake science experiments!\n#TheDadLab #fakescience #dontbefooled\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

In viral videos, it appears this is true, but this is a lie! They\u2019ve swapped out the coke for iodine water, which is a similar colour to coke. To make Iodine water, you need to add about 1 tbsp of Iodine to half a litre of water. When you add half of a tsp of vitamin c, it splits the Iodine molecules into colourless ions resulting in the brown liquid changing into a clear one!\nBut we can use real science to make the colour return by adding six tbsp of hydrogen peroxide and one scoop of starch. I added a bit of water to the glass just to make it easier to mix.\nThree colourless Iodine ions combine with one starch molecule, which returns them to their original colour.\nWhen you add Vitamin C to authentic coke, the chemical reaction is completely different and similar to when you put mentos in!\nThis science experiment is fake!\nHit follow to see me debunk more fake science experiments!\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiment #dontbefooled\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

In this video, we are testing this out by recreating the experiment. \nWe all know how hot air balloons work. This experiment is a similar concept but on a smaller scale. A flame will heat the air molecules around it. Science tells us that hot air rises because it becomes less dense. The mask acts as the hot air balloon, trapping the hot air inside and lifting the mask. Even if a small candle like this could generate enough heat to lift the weight of this surgical mask and candle itself, the mask isn\u2019t enclosed enough, and the material allows air to pass through it. \nThis flying mask experiment is fake!\nFollow along to see me debunk more fake science experiments!\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiment #dontbefooled\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Do you think freezing a peanut butter covered piece of coal creates a diamond? Check out this video to find out! \nDiamonds form in the Earth\u2019s mantle under extreme heat and pressure. The diamonds are then delivered to the Earth\u2019s surface through rare volcanic eruptions, which carry some of the Earth\u2019s mantle to the surface.\nWe are not recreating this process by covering coal in peanut butter and freezing for 24 hours!\nIt\u2019s easy to fake this experiment by swapping out the piece of coal for a piece of quartz in a mixture of flour & black paint, and peanut butter. So, when we wash away the first layer with warm water, it reveals a piece of quartz. You can, in fact, hide anything in this fake piece of coal - a toy, a key or an engagement ring (this could be a pretty creative marriage proposal).\nBut, when we wash the genuine piece of coal coated in peanut butter and frozen, there is no diamond, and if we break it open, we can see its coal throughout! \nThis experiment is fake!\nHit follow for more fake science experiments.\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiment #dontbefooled\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Let\u2019s brighten up the day with this DIY rainbow instrument and a joyful jingle to play for all! The panpipes are a woodwind instrument that has brought happiness all around, even back to ancient greek when they were first invented. These instruments are usually made from bamboo or reeds, but today you can make your own using materials you already have at home. We make ours into a vibrant rainbow assortment, but feel free to create your own patterns with any colours you like. Then, simply blow into the pipes to hear a merry melody!\n\n\u2b55MATERIALS:\n- 5 sheets of paper in rainbow colours (you can also use any other colours you have)\n- Scissors\n- Pen\n- Glue\n- Cardstock \n\n\u2b55INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) First, take your coloured paper and cut them into rectangles. Make sure every piece is bigger than the last until you have all different sizes.\n(1a) Remember to keep hold of the offcuts.\n(2) Use the pen to help roll the paper around it. Keep in mind that tubes with smaller diameters make louder sounds.\n(3) Secure the paper together using glue.\n(4) Once dry, slide the paper off of the pen. Now you have your first pipe.\n(5) Repeat this process with the remaining coloured paper until you have 7 pipes in different sizes.\n(6) Leaving your pipes to one side, take each colour of offcut paper and make a circle that is big enough to fit over the end of each pipe. \n (6a) A helpful tip is to draw around the top of the pen lid, so it is a perfect size.\n(7) Glue each circle to the bottom of the correct colour.\n(8) Next, cut a strip of cardstock big enough to fit nicely around all seven pipes.\n(9) Arrange the pipes into size order and glue a strip of card around all of the pipes.\n(10) Once dried, you now have a bright and cheerful instrument. Gently blow into the open end of each pipe to play! \n#TheDadLab #simplecrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Playdough doesn\u2019t have to just be for little kids. Here is a fun way for the older ones to join in. From measuring and mixing the dough to making a light glow, this experiment is sure to be engaging and exciting for all. \n\n\u2b55MATERIALS:\n- Flour (160g)\n- Salt (160g)\n- Water (230ml)\n- Vegetable Oil (1 tbsp)\n- Lemon Juice\n- Food Colouring (optional)\n- Component LED\n- 9v Battery Pack\n- 2 Battery Cables (Double-end alligator clips) \n\n\u2b55INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) First, we need to make the dough. In a bowl, mix the flour, salt, water, oil and lemon juice together until you max a dough.\n(2) Split the dough into 2 even pieces. Here you can add your food colouring if preferred. \n(3) When your dough is ready, take a small section of each piece and roll them into small balls.\n(4) Add the longer wire to one ball of the dough and the shorter wire to the other. \n(5) Now taking your first cable, attach one clip to the + side of your battery.\n(6) With your second cable, attach one clip to the - side of your battery.\n(7) Holding the opposite clips, press them onto your dough balls and watch the LED light up.\n(7a) You must make sure that the + side is touching the dough with the longer LED leg and the - is touching the shorter leg.\n(8) Now you can test out different kinds of circuits. Here we are using 3 balls of dough and 2 LEDs. The light does not shine as bright with just one battery pack. So, we have added a second one, attaching them together + to -, then adding the clips as before. \n(9) Next we have rolled the dough to make 2 long shapes and have added 3 LEDs. \nWhat other shapes and circuits can you make?\n\n\u2b55SCIENCE EXPLAINED:\nSo how does this work? Salted playdough conducts electricity. The LED bridges the gap between + and - and the light starts to shine. This is known as a series circuit. When rolling out the playdough into 2 longer shapes side by side, this allows electricity to pass through all the LEDs at the same time. This is known as a parallel circuit. The LED will only light up if the circuit is connected correctly. \n#TheDadLab #kidsscience #scienceexperiments\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Did you know you can make paper move and twist? Here is a fun paper folding craft that will keep little hands busy for ages. The art of folding paper into new and cool things is a Japanese tradition that has grown into a worldwide hobby. It is brilliant for practising those fine motor skills and can help with focusing too. What\u2019s even better is that at the end of it you have your very own craft that changes faces with every twist. You\u2019ll be mesmerised by its kaleidoscope pattern! \n\n\u2b55Materials:\n- 2 pieces of coloured paper (any colour you like)\n- Scissors\n\n\u2b55Instructions:\n(1) Take your first piece of coloured paper and fold one corner to the opposite side and cut off the remaining so you have a square. \n(2) Take the square and fold in half, then cut these into 2 separate rectangles. Repeat this until you have 4 small squares altogether.\n(3) Taking one square, fold a corner to meet the other diagonally, unfold and repeat on the other side.\n(4) Next, fold each corner into the middle X crease.\n(5) Unfold, then refold in half to make a rectangle and unfold again.\n(6) Fold both sides of the paper into the middle crease. \n(7) Following the groove of the creases, push the two sides of the paper inwards to make a triangle.\n(8) Fold all 4 corners of the triangle into the centre, until you have a small square.\n(9) Repeat this with each piece of paper so you have 8 squares.\n(10) Slightly unfold each one so the paper sits neatly inside one another. \n(11) Slowly, close up the chain of paper you have made. Then unfold the piece on each end.\n(12) Attach the two end pieces together to make a circle. Now you can twist your kaleidoscope papercraft!\n#TheDadLab #papercrafts #fidgetspinner\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Have you always wanted to play the guitar, but you only got the chance to play an air guitar? Now you can play and make your own! All you need are materials that you can find in your own recycling bin. Junk modelling is a great way to upcycle the things we don't need anymore. This DIY is sure to be fun all while you're making it and after when you have a brand new instrument to rock out with!\n\n\u2b55Materials:\n- Empty plastic bottle\n- Scissors\n- Recycled plastic ribbon\n- Chopsticks\n\n\u2b55Instructions:\n(1) Take your empty bottle and carefully cut a rectangle out of the middle.\n(2) Now, turning your bottle upside down, cut a small hole in the bottom. \n(3) Next, get your string and feed it through the bottom hole.\n(4) When it is through, tie a knot at the end so we can make the string nice and tight.\n(5) Once your knot is in place, place the end of the string through the opening of the bottle.\n(6) Then, tie your chopsticks to the loose string and make a knot. Make sure that your string is tight.\n(7) Now your guitar is assembled, it's time to rock out. Move the chopsticks up and down while plucking the guitar string to hear the different pitches!\n#TheDadLab #invitationtoplay #recycleandplay #recycledcrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Any mini Thomas Edison\u2019s out there? Another everyday item that we tend to overlook is the lightbulb. How do we get light from flipping on a switch? Well, why not create your own at home and learn exactly how they work. \n\n\u2b55MATERIALS:\n- Small glass (around 1.50z)\n- 2 battery cables (with double-end clips)\n- Electrical tape\n- Scissors\n- Glass jar\n- 2 D batteries\n- Copper wire\n\n\u2b55INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Taking the first battery cable, tape it to the bottom of the glass. Make sure not to tape the clip as we will need this later.\n(2) Repeat this with the second battery cable and leave the glass upside down.\n(3) Now take the 2 batteries, tape them together + to - side.\n(4) Cut a small strip of copper wire and place it in between the 2 clips that are secured to the small glass. \n(5) Place the large glass jar over the smaller one. Make sure the other end of the wires is outside of the glass.\n(6) Touch both clips to the ends of the D batteries and watch the wire glow.\n\n\u2b55SCIENCE EXPLAINED:\nWhen a light switch is turned on, electricity is sent from a power source to heat a filament. The batteries act as a source of power in which the electricity is sent through the cables and to the copper wire. This then heats the wire up until a glow is produced. Now you have made another simple circuit!\n#TheDadLab #kidsscience #electrical\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Here is a fun way to reuse old or broken items from around the house and create something new and wonderful. This DIY is known as upcycling and it\u2019s a fantastic way for parents and children to spend some time together as they make something fun. We are using old colouring pencils (but any sort of pencil will do) and we\u2019ll make a xylophone for all the family to play with. Even your baby sibling will be drawn to this colourful craft and enjoy banging on the keys!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Cardboard\n- Scissors\n- 2 wooden skewers\n- 2 beads or balls\n- Pencil sharpener\n- Coloured pencils (or normal pencils)\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) Firstly, using your scissors, cut the cardboard into 4 rectangles that will create a trapezium shape when put together.\n (1a) For reference, the longer sides should be equal to one another. The right-hand side should be smaller than the equal-sized rectangles and the left-hand side should be the smallest.\n(2) Once you have all 4 sides, take the two longer equal sides and make triangular incisions on the parallel edge of each other. This is where the pencils will rest.\n(3) Next, cut out slots about halfway into each cardboard piece for them to all interlock together. \n (3a) See how we have done it in the video. You could also ask an adult for help on this bit!\n(4) Place all the pieces together, making sure that the ridges for the pencils are facing upwards. Now you have your base in the shape of a trapezium\n(5) Place this to one side and take your 2 wooden skewers or rods. Place the balls or beads onto the end of each skewer. These will be your xylophone sticks (also known as mallets)\n(6) Make sure your pencils are different lengths and place them in their allotted spaces\n(7) Now your xylophone is complete, take your sticks and play a tune!\n#TheDadLab #simplecrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Lots of everyday items use motors: cars, fridges, washing machines, fans and vacuum cleaners. This doesn\u2019t sound too exciting, but that is because we don\u2019t see them in action. So here is a fun way to create your own motor and watch how a wire with electrical current acts in a magnetic field.\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\n- AA battery\n- 2 paper clips\n- Tape \n- Copper wire\n- Pen\n- Small magnet\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Taking your paper clips, fold them out to make a small hole in the middle.\n(2) With the first paper clip, take one hooked end and secure it to the top of the battery using tape.\n(3) Repeat this with the second paper clip. Make sure the other hooked ends are facing the same direction.\n(4) Place this to one side. Then take your pen and copper wire. Wrap the wire around the pen about ten times to make a coil. \n(5) After sliding the coiled wire of the pen, twist each end around to tighten and secure it. Make sure to leave a small piece of wire out on each side.\n(6) Taking your battery, carefully place each end of the wire through the hole in the paper clips.\n(7) Set this down and place your magnet on top of the battery but underneath the copper wire. Now watch your mini motor spin into action!\n\n\u2b55 SCIENCE EXPLAINED:\nThe paper clips and wire created an electrical circuit that can carry current. Current flows from the negative terminal of the battery, through the circuit, to the positive terminal of the battery. The current creates a magnetic field, which interacts with a magnetic field coming from a magnet underneath and makes out motor spin.\n#TheDadLab #kidsscience #scienceiscool\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Vegetables don\u2019t just have to be for eating. Here are some cute ideas to turn those vegetables into some heartfelt cards or gifts. Using celery, tomatoes and onions, you can make a whole garden of vegetable printed flowers! \n\n\u2b55 Celery Roses \nAs Alice in Wonderland sings \u201cwe\u2019re painting the roses red\u201d! Well, for us, we are painting celery red. But they do turn into beautiful rose prints in the end. Cutting the stalk of celery reveals a pattern that looks similar to the lovely flower. Add some paint and some stems and you\u2019ll transform your paper into a wonderful rose garden.\n\n\u2b55 Tomato Flowers \nDid you know tomatoes can make art? Cut them in half and add some paint, when printed to the paper they make a lovely floral pattern. Add some green leaves and stems and then you have a handmade card to give to someone special.\n\n\u2b55 Onion Bouquet \nA real bouquet of onion flowers would probably make you cry! But printing with an onion to make flowers sounds like a better idea. Simply, cut your onion in half, add some paint and print. Add a few extra details and there you have it! A fun painting activity that is sure to put a smile on anyone\u2019s face.\n#TheDadLab\u00a0#artsandcrafts\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Add different colours and details to make a whole picture.\n\n\u2b55 Fingerpainting Trees \nThe leaves change with every passing season. Sometimes the trees are green, sometimes they are orange and brown. Here our tree is a rainbow delight! Help add the leaves to the tree picture using finger painting. What season will you make it? Or maybe it\u2019s a family tree and you can add your own names.

      "description": "Can a bent nail straighten when put in salty water with a battery?\nDespite how it appears, the battery and salt have no effect here. What's crucial is the material of the nail and the temperature of the water; this is where science comes in.\nThe nail is made out of Nitinol - an alloy of nickel and titanium. Nitinol is also known as memory metal as it remembers its previous form. When exposed to 500 degrees Celsius for 5 minutes, the atoms inside Nitinol become fixed in their position. Once cooled to room temperature Nitinol can be bent out of shape and will remain deformed; however, if the metal is heated again, with hot water, for example, it will return to its original form, as seen in the video with the nail and the paper clip.\nThis experiment is deceiving, but there is the real science behind it.\nHit follow to avoid being fooled again!\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiment #dontbefooled\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Make as many different boards and mazes as you like, for hours of fun!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Cardboard\n- Hot glue gun & glue\n- Ruler\n- Pencil \n- Tape\n- Coloured card\n- Pen\n- Marble\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) To make your board, start with a square piece of cardboard and glue boarders around each edge.\n(2) Next, glue 3 small pieces of cardboard together and secure them to the board. Repeat this until you have 3 plinths.\n(3) With another piece of cardboard, measure 4, 3cm rectangles and use the ruler to score them. \n(4) Fold them to make a square and tape it secure.\n(5) Repeat step 3 and 4, then glue them on either side of the board.\n(6) Taking another square piece of cardboard, glue a piece of coloured card on top. \n(7) Use a pen and a ruler to draw a maze pattern. Then add strips of cardboard to each line with hot glue. Also, make sure to cut out a small square for the marble to fall into. (You can also add details like an arrow)\n(8) Now, place your maze on the board. Add the marble and try to balance your way through to find the hole.\n(9) Once your marble has fallen into the hole, you can easily remove the maze and start again. You can make lots of different mazes, simple or tricky, and easily replace them on the board!\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Repeat with the second straw, making sure not to push it all the way into the bottle.\n(3) Take your second bottle and use the pen to mark where to cut. Use a soldering iron to make identical holes on both sides of the bottle.\n(4) Next, make another small hole on one side.\n(5) Cut the second straw and thread the second bottle onto both straws.\n(6) Then, take a third straw and thread it through the third hole.\n(7) With the last bottle, cut it about a quarter of the way down, then use a soldering iron to make 2 holes in the bottle cap.\n(8) Thread this onto the straws and secure it with the hot glue gun.\n(9) Next, cut one of the straws to become shorter and screw the remainder of the bottle back onto the cap.\n(10) Now, glue two bottle caps onto the bottom to make a stand.\n(11) When complete, pour some coloured water into the top and watch what happens.

      "description": "If you\u2019re looking for some science activities that will blow your mind, then look no further. Here are some super fun and cool experiments using dry ice, that will certainly have your friends' mouths hanging open with surprise. Dry ice is carbon dioxide (CO2) in a solid form. Yes, it is basically frozen gas. But unlike normal, \u2018wet\u2019 ice, when it begins to melt, it doesn\u2019t turn into water or liquid. Instead, dry ice turns to gas, which gives a foggy effect. You may have seen it used before in theatres and restaurants! But here we will show you a few different ways you can use it at home in these exciting experiments. Even though it sounds very interesting, dry ice can sometimes be dangerous. Please make sure that you are correctly handling it by wearing gloves to protect your skin. Also, remember to never eat it! But now, back to the fun!\n\n\u2b55 Dry Ice Smoke  (Let\u2019s make cold smoke!)\n\u2b55 Floating Dry Ice  (A fun floating experiment)\n\u2b55 Dry Ice Bubbles  (A simple bubbly activity)\n\u2b55 Fire and Ice Experiment   (Watch dry ice react to fire)\n\u2b55 Giant Dry Ice Bubble  (Make a giant bubble)\n\n#TheDadLab #scienceiscool #scienceexperiments #dryice\nDry ice should ALWAYS be handled with gloves, and eye protection must be worn. Never place dry ice in airtight containers. Only use in an area with proper ventilation.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Why not have a balloon boat race? There is no need to stress, all the materials can be found in the comfort of your own home. \n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Balloons\n- Straws\n- Elastic bands\n- Plastic tray or container\n- Bathtub filled with water\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) Place your straw in the deflated balloon and secure it with an elastic band.\n(2) Take your container and make a hole in one side.\n(3) Insert the straw through the hole, with the balloon on the inside of the tray.\n(4) Blow up your balloon, but make sure to hold the end of the straw, so you don't let the air out.\n(5) Place it in the bathtub and let go! Watch it zoom around the water.\n\n\u2b55 Science Explained:\nWhen air is pushed out of a balloon through a straw, it pushes the balloon in the opposite direction. By keeping the balloon secure in a container, the force also moves it as a whole. This is why your boat is moving across the water.\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiments\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "A trip to the arcade was always so much fun. But imagine bringing that fun into your own home! Now you can make a game to play with all the family. Turn your recycled cardboard into something much more fun and make lots of new memories with your own children. This fun DIY activity could be the start of your very own games room. Then you'll be certain to make all your friends jealous!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Cardboard\n- Card\n- Scissors\n- Glue\n- Gimlet\n- Small wooden dowel (x2)\n- Pen\n- Hot glue gun and glue\n- String\n- Paper cup (x2)\n- Stickers (optional)\n- Marble\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) Cut a piece of cardboard into a circle, then glue on a piece of card the same shape.\n(2) Now, use your card to cut out shapes and make a picture. Here we have made a rocket.\n(3) Next, glue a variety of different sized cardboard strips on, to make the board.\n(4) With a new piece of rectangular cardboard, cut it into an arch shape, then add any more card decorations you would like.\n(5) Next, use the gimlet to make a hole in the centre of the circular board. Then attach it to the rectangular board using 1 small wooden dowel.\n(6) On one side of the board, make a square hole and use then pen to mark an X inside. Repeat this step slightly further down the board.\n(7) Now, glue a long piece of cardboard underneath.\n(8) Next, turn the board over. Mark and glue 2 more strips of cardboard in different directions. Add another board behind to keep them in place.\n(9) Placing that to one side, now cut out some cardboard in the shape of a crescent, then glue it to a rolled cylinder of cardboard.\n(10) Insert your second wooden dowel into the cardboard cylinder and attach it to the board, near the bottom.\n(11) Next, cut and glue 4 circles together, make a hole in the middle and attach it to the wooden dowel. Repeat this step with the second dowel and use some hot glue to secure it.\n(12) Tie your string around both of the circles, so they turn in unison.\n(13) Attach 2 larger pieces of cardboard to each side of the board and a small square to the bottom.\n(14) Cut 2 squares on each side of the board, in correspondence to where the ramps at the back of the board are.\n(15) Cut 2 paper cups in half and attach the bottom sections underneath each hole. Here is where you can add a 'happy' and a 'sad' sticker to each.\n(16) Now, add your marble to the top and use the handle to try to twist it into the correct hole. Your pinball game is ready to play!\n#TheDadLab #diytoys #recycledcrafts #cardboard #cardboardplay =====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Magicians are all about tricking the eye. This super cool experiment will give the illusion that flowing water has frozen in time. The water comes out so perfectly, that it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s moving at all. You\u2019ll need only a few simple supplies, but everyone will think you are a top wizard! And if you want to be a magician that does reveal their tricks, we have explained the science behind it below!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Balloon\n- Tape\n- Water\n- Bowl\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) Fill your balloon with a lot of water and tie the end.\n(2) Place the balloon into the bowl.\n(3) Next, add tape to the balloon in a square shape, but make sure to leave a small open section in the middle.\n(4) When the tape is secured, press a needle into the small square of the balloon.\n(5) Watch the water flow like a fountain and then steadily trick your eyes like it\u2019s not moving!\n\n\u2b55 Science Explained:\nThis experiment is known as a laminar flow. The tape keeps the balloon secure and the surface even. When a hole is made in the balloon, the tape keeps it in place and allows the water to flow out in a nice stream. The flowing water moves without any disruptions, which gives the effect of it being frozen and not moving at all!\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiments #scienceisfun #sciencerules #scienceforkids #sciencecommunication #scienceproject #sciencekids \n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Quick! Catch that marble! Here is a fun DIY game you can make with supplies you already have at home. Some of these are leftover party supplies, but just because the party is over, doesn\u2019t mean the fun has to stop. Instead of throwing those spare cups and skewers out, why not turn them into this entertaining game? Pop the marble in the top then try to catch it before it hits the bottom!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Cardboard\n- Pen\n- Wooden skewers\n- Scissors\n- Hot glue gun and glue\n- Paper cup\n- Tape\n- Gimlet\n- Pencil\n- Coloured card (optional)\n- Marble\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) First, take a large piece of cardboard and use the pen to mark dots across it.\n(2) Next, take some wooden skewers and cut them into small pieces. Poke each piece onto a dot.\n(3) With a smaller piece of cardboard, cut out the shape of a games controller. Repeat this 3 times, then glue all 4 pieces together.\n(4) Next, cut out 6-8 squares of cardboard and glue them all together. Then glue this to the back of the controller.\n(5) Cut out 4 rectangular pieces of cardboard and glue them together. Then glue this to the bottom of a paper cup.\n(6) To assemble the board, you\u2019ll need a rectangular box. Cut one side off then tap it flat.\n(7) Add in the board with the skewers to the top and fold the flap to secure it.\n(8) Then add another piece of cardboard to the top and one to the bottom.\n(9) Next, poke a hole into the cardboard with a paper cup attached and the controller.

      "description": "Here is a cool activity that seems to defy forces. Pushing needles and skewers into a balloon will surely make it pop? Well, not quite! Here we show you how you can insert a sharp object into a balloon without it popping! We have two different ways to show you, so make sure you take notes, so you can show all of your friends!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Balloons\n- Tape\n- Needles\n- Skewers\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) Blow up the balloon and tie it closed.\n(2) Place some thick tape onto the balloon\n(3) Then gently pierce your needle through the tape and balloon.\nHow many needles can you add?\n(4) Blow up another balloon and tie it closed.\n(5) Take a wooden skewer and insert it into the bottom of the balloon.\n(6) Push it all the way through and out the top of the balloon, without it popping!\n\n\u2b55 Science Explained:\nBalloons pop easily when there is a quick pressure pushing into one spot. However, when adding tape to the balloon, you're also adding reinforcement to the rubber. This extra layer means the balloon won't stretch and burst as it would usually do when pressed with a needlepoint.\nSimilarly, by making sure you add the skewer to the thickest, less-stretched part of the balloon, there is less pressure being put on the balloon. Instead of bursting, the elasticity of the balloon's rubber allows it to stretch. So now you have unpopable balloons!\n\n#TheDadLab #scienceexperiments #scienceisfun #sciencerules =====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Have you got lots of broken crayons? Bored of colouring in? Let\u2019s try something different and turn them into a mystical magic trick? This idea can help you turn unused items into lots of fun. The instructions are simple to follow, and you won\u2019t need to worry about buying any items. So find out how below!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Crayons\n- Crayon box (or other small box)\n- Tape\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) Before you begin, cut your crayons in half and discard the bottom halves.\n(2) Use the tape to secure them all together in a row.\u00a0\n(3) Place your crayons in the box. (You may need to cut out a small square from your box, so we can see the top half of the crayons)\n Now for the Magic:\n\u2728 When the crayons are in the box, use your fingers to hold them in place in the window. Letting go of the crayons will make them drop into the bottom of the box.\u00a0\n(4) Show your audience the crayons in the box, then with a wave of your hand, they have magically disappeared!\n#TheDadLab\u00a0#magictricks\u00a0#magician\n\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "You may have seen before like someone sets grass or an object alight using a magnifying glass and the sun. But can those two things really create heat? Why not become a scientist for the day and do this fun experiment to test it out for yourself. All you need is 2 balloons, a magnifying glass and the sun! What do you think might happen? Why not write down a hypothesis like a real scientist would? Then have lots of fun trialling this super science experiment.\u00a0\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Black balloon\n- Clear balloon\n- Balloon pump (optional)\n- Magnifying Glass\n- Sunlight\u00a0\n- Black pen (optional)\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) First, place the black balloon inside the clear balloon.\n(2) Then, using a balloon pump, blow up the black balloon. If you don\u2019t have a balloon pump then blow it up manually with your mouth.\n(3) Tie the black balloon, then blow up the clear balloon bigger than the black one.\n(4) Now, take your balloon outside on a sunny day. Hold a magnifying glass directly in the sun and point it towards your balloon. Watch what happens!\u00a0\n(5) To take this experiment even further, draw a spot on the clear balloon with a black pen.\n(6) Again, hold the magnifying glass in direct sunlight and point it towards the balloon and see what happens!\n\n\u2b55 Science Explained:\nWe all know that the sun is very hot. But did you know that the colour black absorbs heat better than other colours? In this experiment, when direct sunlight hits the black balloon, it absorbs the heat which causes its bonds to weaken, and then it pops. Magnifying glass helps to focus the sunlight into a specific spot and heats up that area quicker. This can also be seen in expansion of this experiment, where the black dot absorbs the heat, making the clear balloon pop.\u00a0\n#TheDadLab\u00a0#scienceathome #scienceisfun\u00a0#scienceexperiment =====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "A day without science would be un-BEAR-able! So here is a sweet and simple science experiment, using those delicious gummy bears, that you can try at home, today! During this activity, children can become mini scientists and begin to make predictions about how each gummy bear will react to different variables. They can record their thoughts and then compare them to their findings. This experiment is also great for teaching osmosis (the process where water molecules move from a high concentration to a lower one). Why not give it a try today?\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- 5 glasses\n- 5 gummy bears\n- Water (\u00bd cup)\n- Sugar (1 tbsp)\n- Salt (1 tbsp)\n- Fizzy cola drink (\u00bd cup)\n- Vinegar (\u00bd cup)\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) To set up this experiment, pour water into 3 of the glasses.\u00a0\n(2) Leave the first glass to just have water in it. In the second glass, add the sugar and in the third glass, add the salt.\u00a0\n(3) In the fourth glass, pour in some fizzy cola drink and in the fifth pour in the vinegar.\n(4) Then, add a gummy bear into each glass.\n(5) Wait for 12 hours then take a look at each gummy bear. What differences can you spot? How do they compare to a normal gummy bear?\n#TheDadLab\u00a0#scienceexperiment #scienceteacher #gummybears\n\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Plus, all you need are a few household materials you probably already have on hand. Follow the instructions to create a vacuum using a tray, candle, and glass cup. Then, test the strength of your vacuum by adding objects to the tray and see if it can hold up the extra weight. This activity is a great way to teach about air pressure and vacuum suction.

      "description": "A great way to encourage children to wash their hands is by showing them how dirty their environment really can be. This science experiment may be kind of gross, but it is the perfect example of how much bacteria can grow just by touching everyday things. When doing this activity, don\u2019t forget to wash your hands after everything you touch and wear gloves when handling anything with mould and bacteria on it. You can change the variables to ones that suit you best but remember to leave one piece of bread fresh and untouched so you can compare the differences.

All you need is some large balloons, water, and small figurines of the characters. Simply fill the balloons with water and add the figurines, then let them freeze overnight.\nOnce frozen, you can break open the ice eggs by tapping them or using warm water and salt. But the fun way is to use a hammer! Just make sure to wear gloves to protect your hands while breaking the eggs.\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "\u201cThere\u2019s a worm in the bottom of my garden and its name is Wiggly Woo!\u201d Bring a cherished nursery rhyme to life by introducing simple science to your little ones. It doesn\u2019t just have to be for little children too. This activity can be fun for all ages, with younger children watching the wiggly worms grow in water and the older children can design and create their own worms! \n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n- Tissues\n- Pens\n- Pencil\n- Tray\n- Water\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) First, use your pens to draw a nice design onto your tissue. \n(2) When you\u2019re happy with your design, roll the tissue around the pencil.\n(3) Push and scrunch it together so it is tight, then slide it off of the pencil.\n(4) When your worms are ready, fill your tray with water.\n(5) Pop them inside and watch them grow!\n\n\u2b55 Science Explained:\nThis fun little experiment has a really quick and easy explanation too. Tissues absorb water. They have strong bonds within them, which the water clings onto. So when the tightly wound worm was placed in the water, it sucks it in which makes it expand and appear to be growing. \n#TheDadLab #kidsactivities\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

      "description": "Dive into the fascinating world of science with everyday materials. This experiment is a thrilling educational experience that everyone can participate in. Little ones will be amazed to see an LED light up using simple items, and older kids can take part in setting up the experiment themselves!\n\n\u2b55 Materials:\n* Copper Coins\n* Aluminum foil\n* Card\n* Vinegar\n* Salt\n* LED\n* Scissors\n* Sticky Tape\n* Wires\n* Craft stick or a spoon for stirring\n\n\u2b55 Instructions:\n(1) First, clean your copper coins using a solution of vinegar and salt. This will enhance the reaction in the experiment.\n(2) Cut the card and aluminium foil into circular shapes that match the size of your cleaned coins.\n(3) Soak the cut-out card pieces in vinegar.\n(4) Assemble each soaked card piece between a copper coin and a piece of aluminium foil, creating a \"coin sandwich\". Stack few layers, always ensuring the order is coin-card-foil.\n(5) Secure the stacks with sticky tape and connect wires to the top and bottom.\n(6) Lastly, attach wires to your LED. Sit back and watch the magic happen as it lights up!\n\n\u2b55 Science Explained:\nThis exciting experiment utilises fundamental concepts of electrochemistry and electrical circuits. When the cleaned copper coins (made of metal) and the vinegar (an acid) interact, they generate a small electric charge. This process, known as an electrochemical reaction. The aluminium foil acts as a conductor, allowing the accumulated charge to travel through the coin-card-foil stacks, powering the LED in the process. It's a hands-on, engaging way to understand how batteries work, using items you can easily find around the house.\n#TheDadLab #scienceiscool\n\n=====================================================\n\u279c TheDadLab on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c TheDadLab on Twitter: https://twitter.com/thedadlab\n\u279c TheDadLab on Pinterest: https://pinterest.com/thedadlab/\n\u279c Website: https://thedadlab.com/\n=====================================================\nPlease subscribe to see more upcoming videos http://bit.ly/ThedadlabOnYoutube",

Let's transform paper into a glowing masterpiece!\n\n\u2b55 MATERIALS:\nChristmas Tree Drawing or a print\nFoil tape\nCoin cell battery\nLED light\n\n\u2b55 INSTRUCTIONS:\n(1) Draw or print a Christmas tree on your paper.\n(2) Use foil tape to create a path from the LED's negative side to one side of the battery.\n(3) Bend a corner of the paper to bring the foil tape into contact with the other side of the battery.\n(4) Test your LED light. Once it lights up, stick it on the tree.\n(5) Watch as your Christmas tree craft becomes a glowing beacon of festive joy!\n\n\u2b55 SCIENCE EXPLAINED: \nThis simple circuit uses a coin cell battery to power the LED. When the foil tape connects the LED to the battery, it completes the circuit, allowing electricity to flow and light up the LED.

Join us in this fascinating science experiment as we explore the chemical reaction between Coke and milk! \ud83e\udd64\ud83e\udd5b #ScienceExperiment #CokeAndMilk\n\nWatch the mixture go through a reaction that creates a bizarre and intriguing effect! Perfect for science enthusiasts and the curious-minded of all ages!\n\nDon\u2019t miss out on the reaction!\n   - 00:00 Introduction\n   - 00:05 Testing how much milk we need\n   - 02:27 The Mixing Begins\n   - 03:01 24 hours later\n\nScience Behind\nThe Coca-Cola has a special chemical in it called phosphoric acid. This acid reacts with the calcium that is naturally found in the milk. When the acid and calcium mix together, they create a new substance that looks like little white clumps or chunks.\nThese white clumps are actually the milk proteins that have been changed by the acid in the Coca-Cola. The reaction causes the milk proteins to stick together and form this solid, precipitate material that sinks to the bottom of the glass.\nThe two liquids that we started with have now turned into something completely different! The Coca-Cola and milk no longer look the same, and you can see the reaction happening right before your eyes.\n\nIsn't that cool? It just goes to show that when you mix certain things together, you can get some really surprising and interesting results! Let me know if you have any other questions about this Coca-Cola and milk experiment in the comments below.\n\nRemember, always explore science with safety first.
