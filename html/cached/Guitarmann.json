I realized that the two songs were very similar: same key, very similar note structure, and even similar words!\r\n\r\nI wrote and recorded \"Live for You\" in March 2009. For those who think this is a hoax, I have proof that I wrote this song. I have a dated email with this song attached, and there are at least 3 people who have the demo CD I gave them in March 09 with this song on it, even though I didn't copyright it at the time. \r\n\r\nEven though \"Chosen Generation\" was recorded January 2010, I really don't think that somehow my song was an inspiration for \"Chosen Generation.\" The odds of that are beyond slim, and I don't think Chris Tomlin would steal somebody's song. I think it's just a coincidence and a cool one at that. I'm actually inspired to write and record a little more and even someday release a CD. \r\n\r\nStephen Mann\r\nhttp://guitarmann.com",

      "description": "Free charts: https://guitarmann.com/articles/king-kings-chord-chart This is an awesome Hillsong worship song that is very poetic and depicts the story of Jesus. \nMusically, many of the chords share a measure; however, because the song is fairly slow, it's not too hard to switch between chords. One interesting twist in the chords is that the 1/3 chord is replaced with a 6m chord on the 3rd verse. \nBecause the song repeats the verse and chord structure quite a bit, this substitution chords helps keep the verse interesting and not too redundant. Also, there are a few chords that have only 2 beats, and the time technically switches to 2/4 time just for those beats. \nHope you enjoy and happy strumming!",

It's from the \"Always\" album, released by Sparrow Records in September 2022.\n\nMusically, the song is in 4/4 time and is a medium pace. It's in the key of C# or Db; so, it's best to play it on guitar with either capo 1 in C or capo 6 in G. Of course, you can adjust you capo position in case you need a higher or lower key that fits either a male or female vocal better.\n\nThis acoustic guitar lesson will walk you through how to play in each position and includes a full play-along section at the end of the tutorial.\n\nThe chord structure is simple; however, there are several quick chord changes that last for only one beat.\n\nThe easiest way to strum this on guitar, is to play down-strums that follow the rhythm of \"1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and,\" where each gets a down strum. This will help you count out exactly when to play each chord.\n\nAlternatively, you can play the first part of the normal 4/4 strum pattern that you learned in the Beginner Course, and just substitute the last DUDU with one down strum. \n\nThat last down strum will represent the passing chord that lasts for only one beat. \n\nIf a chord doesn't share any other chords with it in the measure (there is no box), then you can use a full strum pattern for that particular chord.  \n\nThe song is a great anthem to add to any worship set on Sunday or otherwise! It's also a great song to play on guitar in either capo position.",

It's in the key of Db (or C#); so, it's best to play it on guitar with either capo 1 in C or capo 6 in G. Of course, you can adjust you capo position in case you need a higher or lower key that fits either a male or female vocal better.\n\nFor instance, the play-along video above is in the key of B, which may be a little more comfortable for a male vocal. To play in the key of B, use a capo on the 4th fret, using the G chord family. Or you can also capo on the 2nd fret and use the A chord family.\n\nFor the strum pattern, I'll cover 3 different ways to play it based on your skill level. The first way is a simplified strum that will work throughout the song.\n\nThe intermediate way to play it will add in a few extra strums to make it sound full and will get your right hand into a simple groove that will help you keep a consistent rhythm throughout the song.\n\nFinally, there is a more advanced strum pattern that will add in some\u00a0percussive sounds so that it sounds like there is a drum playing along with you.\u00a0\n\nYou'll also learn how to add in the intro signature lick as you strum. This is a great worship song to learn on guitar, so spend some time with the tutorial to learn the different ways to play it.\n\nMy Commentary on the Lyrics of this Song: \n\n\"When all I see is the battle\nYou see my victory\nWhen all I see is the mountain\nYou see a mountain moved\"\n\n\"And as I walk through the shadow\nYour love surrounds me\nThere\u2019s nothing to fear now\nFor I am safe with You\"\n\nThis song starts with a the different perspectives of man and God, as it seen in Psalm 23 \"though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.\"\u00a0\n\nThere is a constant battle of fear based on man's perspective; however, the first verse also illustrates that from God's perspective, there is, in fact, nothing to fear!\n\n\"So when I fight\nI\u2019ll fight on my knees\nWith my hands lifted high\nOh God the battle Belongs to You\"\n\n\"And every fear I lay at Your feet\nI\u2019ll sing through the night\nOh God the battle belongs to You\"\n\nThe chorus demonstrates that prayer is the best way to face fear and have our minds renewed (Romans 12), which, in turn, renews our perspective.\u00a0\n\nThe pinnacle of the song, lyrically, is that the act of submitting the battle is in fact the whole point. Fighting the battle is not the point. The fear is only laid to rest upon its submission.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\nThere is also an element of \"singing\" that accompanies submission. Singing and praising God is not possible without that spirit. Worshipping God implies a surrender.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\"And if You are for me\nWho can be against me\nFor Jesus there\u2019s nothing\nImpossible for You\"\n\n\"When all I see are the ashes\nYou see the beauty\nWhen all I see is a cross\nGod You see the empty tomb\"\n\nThe next set of verses reinforces the idea of the first verse and the chorus, but with more bold proclamations found in Romans 8:31 \"And if our God is for us, who can be against us.\"\n\nThe verses also move into a Gospel centered message, basing this perspective on the work of the cross and resurrection.\u00a0\n\nLet's take a look at the lyrics of the bridge:\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\"Almighty Fortress\nYou go before us\nNothing can stand against The power of our God\"\n\n\"You shine in the shadow\nYou win every battle\nNothing can stand against The power of our God\"\n\nThe proclamations get even bolder at this point in the song, and are the natural progression of a state of fear to a state of confidence in Christ. The perspective shifts from man looking at himself in fear, to looking solely to God in confidence.\u00a0\n\nThe chorus repeats with another exclamation point that the battle belongs to God. This is a great worship song that is upbeat and if a great one to learn on guitar!",

It's in the key of B; so, it's best to play it on acoustic guitar with a capo on the 4th fret in G. Of course, you can adjust you capo position in case you need a higher or lower key that fits either a male or female vocal better.\n\nFor instance, the play-along video above is in the key of G, which may be a little more comfortable for a male vocal. \n\nBecause the song is 102 beats per minute, it's on the faster side and requires a pretty quick strum pattern. I'll cover a few different ways to play it in the guitar tutorial above.\n\nThere are also a few different ways to play it, depending on the part of the song. The bridge, for instance, starts down and then ramps up. Once you know the different strum patterns for the different parts of the song, you'll be able to play right along. \n\nYou'll also learn how to play the intro lick in case you are interested. This is a simple 2 string lick for electric; however, you can also play it on acoustic. \n\nNow, let's take a look at the lyrics of Great Things:\n\nCome let us worship our King\nCome let us bow at His feet\nHe has done great things\n\nSee what our Savior has done\nSee how His love overcomes\nHe has done great things\n\nLyrically, this song begins with a simple call to worship. Keep this in mind, as it's a great song as an opener in a worship set. \n\nThe focus is on what God has done for us; specifically, His love for as our our Savior. This verse implies that the work of God is salvation, itself, and that work is the \"great thing\" that He has done on our behalf.\n\nThere is also an implication that the work He has done is not improving our circumstances, or giving us what we think we want. We're praising Him, rather, for His outworking of salvation, by nature of Him being our Savior.\n\nLet's look at the chorus:\n\nOh hero of Heaven\nYou conquered the grave\nYou free every captive\nAnd break every chain\nOh God You have done great things\n\nThe chorus spells out the heart of the Gospel; Christ was crucified, but through the resurrection, defeated the death and the grave. Through that work, captives can be free, and the chains of sin and death can be broken.   \n\nWe dance in Your freedom\nAwake and alive\nOh Jesus our Savior\nYour name lifted high\nOh God You have done great things\n\nThe second part of the chorus describes our reaction to being saved. We're now awake and alive, having been dead in our trespasses (Ephesians 2:1). Once again, the focus of the response is to the work of Christ and His name worshipped.  \n\nYou've been faithful through every storm\nYou'll be faithful forevermore\nYou have done great things\n\nAnd I know You will do it again\nFor Your promise is Yes and amen\nYou will do great things\n\nThis verse describes the faithfulness of God (1 Corinthians 1:9) as another great thing that He has done. \n\n2 Corinthians 1:20 says that all of the promises of God are \"yes and amen\" through Christ. When these promises are fulfilled, it points to the faithfulness of God.\n\nAfter the chorus repeats, the song moves into the bridge.\n\nHallelujah God above it all\nHallelujah God unshakable\nHallelujah You have done great things\nYou've done great things\n\nThe bridge is another response to the work God has done and affirms God's nature as unwavering. From here, the song moves back into the chorus to end.\n\nEnjoy! And feel free to reach out with any questions or comments.",

There are both light versions and full band versions of this song.\n\nMusically, the song is in 4/4 time and you can play this in key of B, C, or Db, depending on the version you want to play. So, it's best to play it on guitar with a capo on the 4th, 5th, or 6th fret in G. Of course, you can adjust you capo position in case you need a higher or lower key that fits either a male or female vocal better.\n\nThe guitar lesson and play along above is in the key of B. \n\nMost any strum pattern in 4/4 should work with this song, however, I'll cover a unique strum pattern that will work especially well for the bridge of this song.\n\nI'll also cover a finger picking patter that works with this song that can translate to flat picking as well. This is a great chance to stretch yourself into new areas if you want a challenge \n\nFinally, there is a signature lick in the chorus, that I'll show you how to play. As you progress through the lesson, you'll find easy ways to play it at first, and then more challenging ways to play it as we go.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the lyrics of Son of Suffering:\n\nOh the perfect Son of God\nIn all His innocence\nWalking in the dirt\nWith You and me\n\nHe knows what living is\nHe's acquainted with our grief\nA Man of sorrows Son of suffering\n\nLyrically, this song begins with talking about who Jesus is as God. He was fully innocent and chose to enter in to the world, according to Philippians 2:6. \n\nHowever the cornerstone verse of this song is Isaiah 53:3: \"He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\"\n\nIn His human experience, He also relates to our temptations and grief that we experience.\n\nLet's look at the chorus:\n\nOh blood and tears\nHow can it be\nThere's a God who weeps\nThere's a God who bleeds\n\nOh praise the One\nWho would reach for me\nHallelujah to the Son of suffering\n\nThe chorus further explains God's relational characteristics expressed through weeping (John 11:35), and through bleeding. The chorus also turns to a responsive \"Hallelujah\" in praise.   \n\nSome imagine You\nAre distant and removed\nBut You chased us down\nIn merciful pursuit\n\nTo the sinner You were grace\nAnd the broken You embraced\nAnd in the end\nThe proof is in Your wounds\nYes, in the end\nThe proof is in Your wounds\n\nThe second verse turns back to man to address the common view of God, in that He is removed or too distant to care about our daily lives. However, Christ's demonstration of love on the cross also demonstrated His relational care for His sheep.\n\nOne verse that shows this is John 15:13, that \"Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\" We are considered friends.  \n\nNow, let's take a look at the Bridge lyrics:\n\nYour cross my freedom\nYour stripes my healing\nAll praise King Jesus\nGlory to God in Heaven\n\nYour blood still speaking\nYour love still reaching\nAll praise King Jesus\nGlory to God forever\n\nThe bridge highlights some parallels between the suffering of Jesus and the result for the believer. From the cross, is freedom, and from stripes are healing. It lands with a response of worship. This is a great song to strum, or pick on guitar, and I hope you challenge yourself with the lesson above.",

This song has an unusual timing; however, once you learn how to follow the chords, you'll be able to play along easily. \n\nYou'll have a choice of different capo options, but for this lesson, we'll focus on using the G chord family using a capo on 3rd fret.\n\nYou also learn how to play the intro lick within the chords, and you'll learn how to play the electric guitar part.  \n\nHouse of the Lord, also known as There's Joy in the House of the Lord, is a worship song written by Jonathan Smith, and Phil Wickham. It was released in 2021 on the label, Phil Wickham.\n\nThis song is an upbeat worship song about the joy that's in the house of the Lord, most likely referring to the gathered church. The song begins with a call to worship and moves into an expression of praise.\n\nThe first verse starts with identifying the object of the church's worship:\n\nWe worship the God who was\nWe worship the God who is\nWe worship the God who\nEvermore will be\n\nFrom there the chorus affirms the joy of believers, and their loud proclamation: \n\nThere\u2019s joy in the house of the Lord\nThere\u2019s joy in the house\nOf the Lord today\nAnd we won\u2019t be quiet\nWe shout out Your praise\n\nThere\u2019s Joy in the house of the Lord\nOur God is surely in this place\nAnd we won\u2019t be quiet\nWe shout out Your praise\n\nThe second verse speaks of the ways in which God is victorious, by illustrating some of the miracles of God in the Bible: \n\nHe opened the prison doors\nHe parted the raging sea\nOur God He holds the victory\n\nThe third as fourth verses describes more attributes of God, both in His nature as well as what he did for us as God. This set of verses ends with the core of the Gospel in Christ's work on the cross: \n\nWe sing to the God who heals\nWe sing to the God who saves\nWe sing to the God who always\nMakes a way \n\n'Cause He hung upon that Cross\nThen He rose up from that grave\nMy God\u2019s still rolling stones away\n \nNext, the bridge of the song looks at the affect of the Gospel on believers and parallels the change of before and after someone is redeemed. Most of the language here is metaphorical and is referring to the spiritual state of a believer, not the literal circumstances of a believer.  \n\nWe were the beggars\nNow we\u2019re royalty\nWe were the prisoners\nNow we\u2019re running free\nWe are forgiven accepted\nRedeemed by His grace\nLet the house of the Lord sing praise\n\n\nFinally, the song wraps up with a few more choruses to re-emphasize them main themes of the song. \n\nThis is a great song to help begin a worship service. I hope you enjoy learning how to play it!",

The lyrics speak to the day when problems will be no more and every prayer in answered.\n\nEach verse demonstrates the reality of pain and desperation, while looking ahead. The lyrics of chorus affirm that \u201cThere will be a day when all will now before Him. There will be a day when death will be nor more. Standing face to face with He who died and rose again. Holy holy is the Lord.\u201d\n\nMusically, the song starts with simple piano chords, with little accompaniment. The melody is simple and easily sung. The chorus introduces a little more energy and introduces more chord changes.\n\nThere is a simple melodic piano lick that happens at the end of the chorus in order to easily identify the song and help it move back into the next verse. We'll cover this as a guitar lick.\n\nAs the song progresses, it builds musically into strong and vibrant choruses that are suited well for a full choir. Finally, the song ends with a tag to emphasize the last few words and then musically ends with a strong chord.",

This song uses G chord family chords with the capo on the 5th fret, which puts it in the key of C. You can also play it with C chords and no capo. This guitar lesson covers both!\n\nHere is more info if you're new to the Nashville Number System and this style of charting: https://guitarmann.com/articles/studio-charts\n\nWho Wrote Run to the Father?\nThe worship song Run to the Father was written by Cody Carnes, Matt Maher, and Ran Jackson and was released in 2020 on the label Sparrow Records. \n\nWhat is Run to the Father About?\nRun to the Father has the themes of God's grace, love, mercy, trust, and surrender. Some of the scripture verses used for this song include: Matthew 11:28-30, Luke 15:17-20, and Psalm 40:11-16.  \n\nLet's look at the lyrics of this song to see how it flows:\n\nVerse 1\n\nI\u2019ve carried a burden\nFor too long on my own\nI wasn\u2019t created\nTo bear it alone\n\nVerse 2\n\nI hear Your invitation\nTo let it all go\nI see it now\nI\u2019m laying it down\nI know that I need You\n\nThe verses talk about recognizing the weight that we carry and the need for surrendering that to God. This realization establishes our need for Him. From here, we move into the chorus: \n\nChorus\n\nI run to the Father\nI fall into grace\nI\u2019m done with the hiding\nNo reason to wait\n\nMy heart needs a surgeon\nMy soul needs a friend\nSo I\u2019ll run to the Father\nAgain and again\nAnd again and again\n\nHere is the answer to our need: running to the Father. This picture reminds me of the prodigal son in the Bible. He saw his need and ran back to the father, because He knew he would be accepted. Here, we move into the next verses: \n\nVerse 3\n\nYou saw my condition\nHad a plan from the start\nYour Son for redemption\nThe price for my heart\n\nVerse 4\n\nI don\u2019t have a context\nFor that kind of love\nI don\u2019t understand\nI can\u2019t comprehend\nAll I know is I need You\n\nThese verses speak to God's point of view and his providential plan of salvation. There is also a response of amazement and a return to our need for God, which again, sets up the chorus. The bridge happens later in the song: \n\nBridge 1\n\nMy heart has been in Your sights\nLong before my first breath\nRunning into Your arms\nIs running to life from death\n\nBridge 2\n\nI feel this rush deep in my chest\nYour mercy is calling out\nJust as I am You pull me in\nI know I need You now\n\nAfter the bridge, the song returns to the choruses again.",
