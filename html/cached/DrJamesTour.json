      "description": "PART 02: Introduction to Nanotubes\n\nNASA's Microwave Gun Technology: NASA developed a microwave gun to cure shuttle tiles in space, but due to the proprietary nature of the tiles, the technology was not widely shared. Rice University students managed to obtain some tiles and develop related technologies despite this restriction.\n\nNanotechnology Initiatives and Funding: The U.S. government has invested around $40 billion in nanotechnology since 1999, starting with Bill Clinton's administration and continuing through subsequent administrations. Nanotechnology is now integrated into various national programs instead of being a separate entity.\n\nNanotechnology in Products: Nanotechnology has become an integral part of many products, though it is not always labeled due to public hesitation. Products must have dimensions between 1 to 100 nanometers to be considered nanotechnology.\n\nApplications and Advancements: The lecture covers the development and applications of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes, highlighting their unique properties, such as extreme strength and microwave absorption capabilities. The field has grown through shared research and collaboration.\n\nHistorical and Personal Anecdotes: The talk includes historical references to key figures and milestones in nanotechnology, personal anecdotes from Dr. James Tour\u2019s experiences, and examples of how nanotechnology has been applied in various scientific and industrial contexts.\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

Graphene's properties change with the number of layers and their alignment.\n\nGraphene Production Methods: Several methods to produce graphene include liquid exfoliation, oxidation, growth on silicon carbide, and chemical vapor deposition. Each method has varying yields and quality of graphene.\n\nAuthentication with Graphene Markers: Dr. James Tour discusses using graphene markers to authenticate high-end products like purses and shoes by embedding markers that can be detected via a smartphone.\n\nElectronic Properties and Potential: Graphene and carbon nanotubes exhibit high electronic mobility, theoretically up to a million cm\u00b2/Vs, which could significantly speed up computing processes.\n\nCommercial and Research Applications: Graphene's diverse applications include transparent conductive films, deicing surfaces, enhancing plastic bottle performance, and potential use in spinal cord injury treatment. Research also explores producing graphene from various carbon sources.\n\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

      "description": "#science #startup #nuclear #prepper \nChallenges in University Startups: Starting a company based on university research can be more effective than licensing to large corporations. However, it involves challenges like managing relationships, intellectual property, and navigating business dynamics, which can strain academic collaborations.\n\nPatents and Intellectual Property: Intellectual property protection is crucial and costly. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 allowed universities to retain ownership of federally funded inventions, spurring startup growth. Filing provisional patents is relatively inexpensive, providing time to develop the invention further before filing a full patent.\n\nFunding and Business Advice: Various funding sources for startups include government grants (SBIR, STTR), angel investors, and venture capitalists. Managing these relationships and understanding the business landscape, including the role of a board of directors, is essential for the success of a startup.\n\nNuclear Event Response: In the event of a nuclear explosion in a city, immediate action is necessary to address the radiation plume, as it can start affecting the city within three hours. Radiation first damages the stem cells in the small intestines, leading to severe health impacts.\n\nDevelopment of Radioprotectant: After 9/11, a need arose for an oral drug that could protect people from radiation exposure quickly. The drug developed, WR2721, showed significant protective effects in mice subjected to high doses of radiation.\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

For example, \u201cwho is going to vote for a person looking like this?\u201d is a fallacy because appearance has nothing to do with one\u2019s leadership abilities.\n\n\"You're trying to protect your religion, liar!\" \ud83d\ude21\n\ud83d\ude18 Circumstantial ad hominem (or appeal to motive) argues that a person\u2019s circumstances, such as their job, political affiliation, religion or other vested interests, motivate their argument and thus it must be biased and false. For example, a salesperson may tell you that the pair of jeans you\u2019re trying on looks good on you, and you may half-jokingly point out that of course they think so since they want to make a sale.\n\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.
