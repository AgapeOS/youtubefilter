Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2 is here!* \nIn this first episode, after looking back to how the prebiotic soup model is being taught in scientific textbooks, we review an interview between Lee Cronin and Dr. James Tour that referenced a previous interview between Lee Cronin and Justin Brierley. In those interviews, Cronin explained his research\u2014an algorithmic search for life\u2014and how the search is for a semantically different type of \"life\"\u2014a molecular system reduced to one that can move towards replicating itself and one that can be created randomly in a lab. Given the requirements for life as we know it today, even crude requirements for the simplest life, involve much more than Cronin's reduced definition, Dr. Tour questioned Cronin for a clarification to a statement he made to Brierley where Cronin affirmed that life arose as a result of chemical reactions in a prebiotic soup. Dr. Tour asked Cronin for evidence of such an extrapolated claim, and he reminded Cronin that, even if evidence of life exists in the fossil record, such evidence doesn't explain the \u201chow\u201d. How simple molecules transitioned from non-living matter into living matter\u2014Dr. Tour reminds us that scientists are clueless on that. When ultimately pinned down on the question, Cronin agreed that we don\u2019t know. \n\n*Don't forget to like, subscribe, and share!* \n\n==== \n*Support us in creating more content across our different media platforms.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n====\n\nCheck out all our episodes: \n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\nVIDEO INDEX\n00:00 Once There Was A Chemist\n01:09 Intro\n01:58 A New Series on Abiogenesis\n03:13 Dear Jim\n04:36 The Hype around OOL\n05:50 Three Chemists Walk Into A Bar\n11:12 Science Communicator\n13:08 Primordial Soup\n15:04 Lee Cronin\n16:55 Let Cronin Speak\n21:31 Salad Dressing\n25:01 How Did Life Come From Primordial Soup?\n25:53 Give Me The Evidence\n30:52 See You Next Time!\n\n#abiogenesis #originoflife #evolution\n\nPapers Addressed in Cronin Series:\n- Spontaneous formation of autocatalytic sets with self-replicating inorganic metal oxide clusters; https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1921536117\n- Autocatalysis: Kinetics, Mechanisms and Design; https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syst.202000026\n- Taming the Combinatorial Explosion of the Formose Reaction via Recursion within Mineral Environments; https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/syst.201900014\n- Formation of oligopeptides in high yield under simple programmable conditions; https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9385\n- Amino Acid Structures; https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/amino-acid-structures\n- Autonomous model protocell division driven by molecular replication; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00177-4\n\nGod bless.\n\n~\nhttps://jesusandscience.org\nDr Tour's Personal Website - http://jmtour.com\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/drjamestour\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/drjamestour\nLinkedIn - http://linkedin.com/in/drjamestour\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/drjamestour\nSnapchat - http://snapchat.com/add/drjamestour\nWeChat - @drjamestour",

Facing accusations of being nefarious and of misquoting terms with an intent to mislead, Dr. James Tour corrects the record and shows how Cronin\u2019s own statements ultimately mislead laypersons to falsely believe that today\u2019s scientists can create life. With Cronin stating awareness of life\u2019s vast requirements, Dr. Tour reminds us that Cronin\u2019s autocatalytic experiments have not generated anything that resembles or moves towards satisfying those requirements. Dr. Tour then digs into published literature by Cronin and exposes how the experimentals lack prebiotic relevance, including a massive yield of products, intentional human removal, and the inability to use the vast array of isomers. Peptides in water (really in dry state), sterilization temperature requirements, and unprotected side chains \u2014 all such things lead to speculation if these are used in an abiogenesis narrative, agrees a peptide chemical expert. \n\n*Don't forget to like, subscribe, and share!* \n\n==== \n*Support us in creating more content across our different media platforms.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n====\n\nCheck out all our episodes: \n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\nVIDEO INDEX\n00:00 University of Glasgow\n00:55 Previously, Lee Cronin Part 01\n02:19 Nefarious\n04:02 Real Life from Scratch\n04:57 Public Perception\n06:07 Drugs and Robots\n06:57 Characteristics of Life\n07:48 Autocatalysis\n11:39 Crude Requirements for Life\n11:55 Invoking a Creator\n12:41 Biased Perhaps?\n14:36 Cannizzaro and Formose Reactions \n17:01 Reading Papers\n17:58 Calcium Hydroxide\n19:57 There are Billions\n21:30 Less of a Mess?\n23:50 So Many Isomers\n25:25 Peptide Wet/Dry Cycles\n28:12 Peptides in Water\n29:22 Peptide Bonds\n29:59 Peptides and Proteins: A Closer Look\n31:07 Dipeptides\n33:15 Sterilization Temperatures\n36:22 Checking Lee Cronin\u2019s Work\n38:20 A Bunch of Junk\n38:43 Next Time: Addressing Lee Cronin Part 03\n\n#abiogenesis #originoflife #evolution\n\nPapers addressed in Cronin series:\n- Spontaneous formation of autocatalytic sets with self-replicating inorganic metal oxide clusters; https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1921536117\n- Autocatalysis: Kinetics, Mechanisms and Design; https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syst.202000026\n- Taming the Combinatorial Explosion of the Formose Reaction via Recursion within Mineral Environments; https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/syst.201900014\n- Formation of oligopeptides in high yield under simple programmable conditions; https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9385\n- Amino Acid Structures; https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/amino-acid-structures\n- Autonomous model protocell division driven by molecular replication; https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00177-4\n\nGod bless.\n\n~\nhttps://jesusandscience.org\nDr Tour's Personal Website - http://jmtour.com\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/drjamestour\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/drjamestour\nLinkedIn - http://linkedin.com/in/drjamestour\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/drjamestour\nSnapchat - http://snapchat.com/add/drjamestour\nWeChat - @drjamestour",

SUBSCRIBE so you'll be notified!* \n\nConcluding the discussion on Lee Cronin, this episode peers into the manufactured oil bubbles from his lab, looking for any resemblance of life's necessary machinery, either in modern cellular life or some prehistoric, protocellular precursor. With characterization data clearly showing a human-engineered and chemically loaded system steered for autocatalysis to yield oil bubbles (and failing to comprise a cellular lipid bilayer), Dr. Tour questions how Cronin's lab and his experiments truly operate autonomously and how the formation of the bubbles has anything to do with biological life. Rolling back the clock, we then watch Cronin present the idea of creating \"evolvable matter\" in the lab, once the \"right chemistry\" has been \"set up\"\u2014rather, \"input\"\u2014by the chemists. With inorganic rust not holding water, and other reactions yielding billions of unusable stereo-scrambled compounds, Cronin's lab hasn't met their projected deadline, yet the religion of prebiotic soup extrapolations continues to be preached. Dr. Tour concludes this episode with a list of outstanding abiogenesis problems in need of a solution.\n\n*Don't forget to like, subscribe, and share!* \n\n==== \n*Support us in creating more content across our different media platforms.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n====\n\nCheck out all our episodes: \n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\nVIDEO INDEX \n00:00 Robots and Salad Dressing \n00:50 Previously, Lee Cronin Part 01 \n02:13 Cronin's Autocatalysis Narrative \n04:33 Autonomous Oil Protocell \n05:15 Contrast Lipid Bilayers \n05:59 Constructing the Automation Machine \n07:16 Prokaryotic Cellular Division \n09:53 Contrast Cronin's Droplet Divisions \n10:22 Marangoni Extrapolation \n11:30 Supplemental Data Reveals Loaded System \n13:28 Cronin's Definition of Autonomous \n13:48 Protein \"Magic\" \n14:56 No Such Magic, Cronin Says \n16:43 Cronin's Watchmaker \n17:51 Cronin at TED \n19:07 How's It Going? \n20:09 Blame Also With The Scientists \n22:16 Review: Outstanding Abiogenesis Problems \n25:04 Who's Next\n25:21 Next Time: Addressing Bruce Lipshutz Part 01\n\n#abiogenesis #originoflife #evolution\n\nPapers addressed in Cronin series:\n- Spontaneous formation of autocatalytic sets with self-replicating inorganic metal oxide clusters; https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1921536117\n- Autocatalysis: Kinetics, Mechanisms and Design; https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/syst.202000026\n- Taming the Combinatorial Explosion of the Formose Reaction via Recursion within Mineral Environments; https://chemistry-europe.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/syst.201900014\n- Formation of oligopeptides in high yield under simple programmable conditions; https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9385\n- Amino Acid Structures; https://www.neb.com/tools-and-resources/usage-guidelines/amino-acid-structures\n\nGod bless.\n\n~\nhttps://jesusandscience.org\nDr Tour's Personal Website - http://jmtour.com\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/drjamestour\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/drjamestour\nLinkedIn - http://linkedin.com/in/drjamestour\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/drjamestour\nSnapchat - http://snapchat.com/add/drjamestour\nWeChat - @drjamestour",

After observing the incorrect reference implying that Cronin\u2019s oligopeptides formed in water, Dr. Tour corrects the record and shows how the reference demands quite the opposite\u2014a dry, 130\u00b0C furnace for 15 hours. Reading beyond just the title of the paper, we see agreement from Lee Cronin as well\u2014thermodynamic equilibrium shifts the reaction, not towards polypeptides, but back to amino acids. The \u201cYouTube professor\u201d was wrong again. We then meet Dr. Bruce Lipshutz, a friend of Dr. Tour, who also agrees with Tour, and in his synthesis, he uses hydrophobic pockets to remove the synthesis from occurring in water, while also adding human-made protecting groups to the amines to remove free amino acids and its active sidechains. With the YouTuber\u2019s erroneous claim of peptide synthesis in water not being a problem now clearly exposed, Dr. Tour summarizes how Dr. Lipshutz\u2019s experiment was not actually a showing of amino acid coupling in water at all, but a demonstration of the need to protect side-chains of the amines and esterify the carboxyl groups, which loaded the system for the chemistry to work\u2014something early Earth could not enjoy. \n\n*Don't forget to like, subscribe, and share!* \n\n==== \n*Support us in creating more content across our different media platforms.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n====\n\nCheck out all our episodes: \n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\nVIDEO INDEX\n00:00 Dilation of a YouTuber's Initiative\n01:32 Email Unraveling \n03:26 Cronin on Peptide Synthesis in Water\n06:31 Look Beyond the Title \n07:50 YouTuber Brings on Bruce Lipshutz \n10:48 Review: Amino Acids, Peptides & Synthesis \n13:38 Bruce's Paper & Where the Chemistry Happens\n14:49 Game Over \u2014 Waterworld 2-2\n15:07 Attacking Amino Acid's Zwitterions \n17:21 Not Amino Acid Coupling\n18:56 No Active Sidechains \n19:15 System: Totally Loaded \n19:20 Summary \n20:31 Misquoting, Twisting & Lying, He Says \n20:59 Next Time: Bruce Lipshutz Part 02\n\n#abiogenesis #originoflife #evolution\n\nGod bless.\n\n~\nhttps://jesusandscience.org\nDr Tour's Personal Website - http://jmtour.com\nTwitter - http://twitter.com/drjamestour\nFacebook - http://facebook.com/drjamestour\nLinkedIn - http://linkedin.com/in/drjamestour\nInstagram - http://instagram.com/drjamestour\nSnapchat - http://snapchat.com/add/drjamestour\nWeChat - @drjamestour",

In this episode, Dr. Tour discloses email communications with his friend Dr. Bruce Lipshutz, and we see how Dr. Lipshutz never approved how the YouTuber elected to misappropriate Dr. Lipshutz\u2019s video clip. Dr. Tour\u2019s expos\u00e9 uncovers how the YouTuber doctored a video to make it appear as if Dr. Lipshutz\u2019s video clip was responding to Dr. Tour\u2019s February 2021 Abiogenesis presentation, which included Tour\u2019s invitation for collegial critique. Dr. Lipshutz clarifies that the video clip he provided the YouTuber indeed was not in response to Dr. Tour\u2019s presentation, yet the YouTuber falsely portrayed it as such. Furthermore, the YouTuber is proven wrong yet again, as Dr. Lipshutz points out that his video clip was referring to peptide synthesis in a hydrophobic pocket, not synthesis \u201cin water\u201d\u2014something even Dr. Lipshutz said would be \u201cridiculous thinking\u201d. Dr. Lipshutz affirms his agreement with Dr. Tour regarding side-chain protection, and the two gentlemanly chemists demonstrate how to engage in civil, scientific dialogue. With this, Dr. Tour continues his invitation for scientific critique. Contrast the YouTuber, who, despite being oblivious to invalidation by his own chosen PhD chemistry expert/professor, mischaracterizes video material the good professor sent him, while advancing a bulveristic argument against Dr. Tour and denigrating the intelligence of Dr. Tour\u2019s viewers. Even more, we see the YouTuber admit to canceling opposing thought under his social media profile, effectively monopolizing his own concocted science to his viewers, many who may be in search of chemistry expertise, but are denied true scientific inquiry. Interestingly, manipulation over scientifically uninformed viewers and denying science was falsely accused against Dr. Tour by the YouTuber. As the YouTuber once said, \u201cAh, sweet irony.\u201d\n\n==== \n*Support us in creating more content across our different media platforms.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n====\n\nCheck out all our episodes: \n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\nVIDEO INDEX\n00:00 False Portrayal & Attempted Dismissal\n02:46 Indeed, Let's \"Chat with Bruce\"\n04:55 Ruh Roh, Bruce Never Saw It!\n06:17 We Welcome Science Here\n07:32 Who Throws Friends Under the Bus?\n07:53 Who Determined \u201cDumb\u201d?\n08:41 \"Deliberate Misrepresentations\" He Says\n09:01 Hydrophobic Domain Is Not Water\n09:31 \"Fine Young Man\"\n10:53 Responding & Asking Again\n13:35 Both Fail To See Why\n14:29 \"Ridiculous Thinking\"\n15:57 Bruce Agrees with Jim\n16:59 A Gentleman & Real Scientist\n17:49 Asking a 3rd Time\n20:09 Jim Correct on Side-Chain Protection\n21:12 Selected Expert Agrees with Jim\n22:03 Bulverist Demonstration\n23:13 \"Team Jesus\"\n24:14 Invoking a Deity Scorecard\n24:56 How to Discuss Science\n26:37 Summary\n27:34 \"Show Paper & Confidently Yammer\" He Says\n28:07 Next Time: Steve Benner Part 01\n\n#abiogenesis #originoflife #evolution\n\nTour-Lipshutz Email Communication:\nhttps://bit.ly/tour-lipshutz-emails\n\nTour\u2019s 2022 publications with ball milling:\n- Urban Mining by Flash Joule Heating; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-26038-9\n- Rare Earth Elements from Waste; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.abm3132\n- High-Surface-Area Corundum Nanoparticles by Resistive Hotspot-Induced Phase Transformation; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-32622-4\n- Bulk Production of Any Ratio 12C:13C Turbostratic Flash Graphene and its Unusual Spectroscopic Characteristics; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.1c03197\n- Sounds of Synthesis: Acoustic Real-Time Analysis of Laser-Induced Graphene; https://doi.org/10.1002/adfm.202110198\n- Heteroatom-Doped Flash Graphene; https://doi.org/10.1021/acsnano.2c01136\n- Waste Plastic- and Coke-Derived Flash Graphene as Lubricant Additives; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2022.12.035\n- Ultra-High Loading of Coal-Derived Flash Graphene Additives in Epoxy Composites; https://doi.org/10.1002/mame.202200640\n\nTour\u2019s publications in Inference: International Review of Science:\nhttps://inference-review.com/contributor/james-tour\n\nLipshutz publication:\nAmide and Peptide Bond Formation in Water at Room Temperature; https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.orglett.5b01812\nLipshutz's paper discussed in Episode 4: https://youtu.be/N_on6LK6Etc\n\nGod bless.",

SUBSCRIBE so you'll be notified!* \n\nRiddle Me This: _A YouTuber discredits thinking like a synthetic chemist. He interviews three. How many blunders does he have?_ \nWe begin this episode by questioning whether autocatalytic cycles magically wash away origin-of-life constraints, such as low yields, enantiomeric excess, and chirality. We then meet Dr. Steve Benner, a synthetic chemist the YouTuber elected to interview, despite whether his thinking may possess \"embarrassing blunders.\" Looking beyond double standards, we witness how Benner admits the constraints of chemistry and wonder: _If the YouTuber's autocatalytic cycle solves all, why hasn't the chemist simply applied this solution to those constraints?_ Contrary to the YouTuber's statements of ease, Benner tells us that actual (and not theoretical) chemistry is \"hard to get to work.\" Indeed, where the rubber meets the road is key, and there are no roads on Fairytale Island. Further revealed is a false claim by the YouTuber and Benner that Dr. Tour leans on a \"God of the Gaps\" argument when addressing abiogenesis, despite his statements to the contrary, yet the \"Lie Detector\" asserts knowing best. Finally, we see how Benner's interview with the YouTuber appeared as if Benner was critiquing Dr. Tour's original abiogenesis series; however, simply by observing how off-base his statements were, whether Benner truly watched the series is seriously called into question. Concluding the episode, Benner's entire commentary becomes invalidated by way of his admission to Dr. Tour when confronted in person \u2014 Steve wasn't paying attention even if/when he did watch it. Unfortunately for the viewer, the riddle's answer quickly becomes lost in embarrassment when trying to add up all these observed blunders. \n\n==\n*Support us in creating more content across our social media.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n==\n\nSee all our episodes:\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\n00:00 Memoirs of a Synthetic Chemist\n03:04 On Autocatalysis & Insufficient Backgrounds\n05:16 Fairytale Island \u2014 No Problems, No Cry\n06:15 Synthetic Chemist \"Embarrassing Blunders\"\n06:28 Synthesizing Double Standards\n07:21 Chemistry Theory vs Reality\n07:47 Benner's World of G-D Problems\n09:35 Extra, Extra!

SUBSCRIBE so you'll be notified!* \n\nAfter witnessing Dr. Steve Benner's misrepresentation of Dr. Tour and his statements on origin of life (OOL), in this episode, we now turn to Benner's chemistry. Looking beyond mere titles and abstracts, we dig into Benner's data, exploring how it suffers from excessive human involvement, despite Benner himself criticizing the notion. After reminding us of the Cannizzaro dilemma and how time presents a problem for synthetic degradation, Dr. Tour exposes how Benner's D-Ribose was just a needle in a haystack of other compounds, rendering it prebiotically irrelevant due to it being completely useless for further reactions. Nevertheless, Benner continues, claiming a \"hands off\" approach, but using \"hands on\" from other chemists, who provide the alleged missing human involvement and relay synthesis along the way, let alone, chemists whose papers reveal they purchased chemicals as by-products from living sources, rending those paths prebiotically irrelevant as well. Dr. Tour also exposes OOL's problem of picking and choosing molecules only when it strikes one's fancy, for example, magnesium chloride and all the amino acids, while abrogating DAP's OOL relevance to boot. Things are not so pure as they seem (and as the chemistry requires), and chemists who extrapolate their claims should simply know better. \n\n==== \n*Support us in creating more content across our different media platforms.* \n*Visit https://jesusandscience.org/#Support to learn more.* \n====\n\nCheck out all our episodes: \n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 2* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t22BWvWsoXCmaXNllbfJ2h7\n\n*Addressing Abiogenesis, Season 1* \nhttps://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLILWudw_84t2THBvJZFyuLA0qvxwrIBDr\n\nVIDEO INDEX\n00:00 Striking One's Fancy\n02:24 Review & Agenda\n03:34 Beyond Abstract, See What They Made\n05:02 Benner's Death Valley\n05:48 Carbohydrates & Prebiotic Relevance\n06:35 Cheating via Relay Synthesis\n08:36 Cannizzaro?

Joya's hilarious story describes an incident when he worked as a kitchen porter, and he left some paella pans (paelleras) at night in the ocean to soak and clean them, and in the morning when he returned to retrieve the pans, they had washed out to sea with the tide. He frequently interrupts the story with his trademark laugh. This story has become a popular meme on the Internet, entertaining millions with intentional mistranslations paired with Joya\u2019s laugh. Thank you \"El Risitas\" for blessing the Internet with this story and your contagious laugh. May you rest in peace. For more on Risitas and this meme, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Risitas",

This premise, which is the basis of the video game and HBO show, \"The Last of Us\" seems hard to imagine. Yet, \"killer fungi\" kill millions every year.\n\nIn a new study published in Advanced Science, Rice University chemist James Tour and collaborators have developed molecular machines that are just as good at combating infectious fungi as they are at killing antibiotic-resistant infectious bacteria and cancer cells. Based on the work of Nobel laureate Bernard Feringa, these nanoscale compounds move in a single direction when exposed to visible light, causing a drilling motion that allows them to bore into the surface of cells and kill them.\n\n#fungalinfection #CandidaAuris, #cdc \n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

      "description": "Flash graphene is a process developed by Rice University professor James Tour and his team that can turn any carbon source into turbostratic graphene in a matter of milliseconds. The process involves heating carbon-containing materials to high temperatures for a short amount of time, which creates graphene flakes. The resulting graphene is low-cost, high-quality, and can be used for a variety of applications such as energy storage, water filtration, and electronics.\n\nDr. James Tour is a synthetic organic chemist and nanotechnologist who is recognized for his research in molecular electronics, graphene electronics, and nanomachines. He is a professor of chemistry, computer science, and materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University and has authored over 700 research publications and 160 patents. In addition to developing flash graphene, Dr. Tour's research has contributed to advancements in carbon nanotubes, nanocars, and other nanotechnology applications.\n\n--\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

      "description": "Dr. James Tour talks science, nanobots, origin of life research and life.\nThis two-part video has been combined and originally debuted on  @LifeinMessiah youtube channel.\n\nIsaiah 53 is often referred to as the \"forbidden chapter\" because it contains a highly controversial and contested prophecy about a suffering servant who will bear the sins of humanity. The chapter speaks of a figure who is despised and rejected, wounded and oppressed, and yet does not defend himself. The suffering servant is described as being \"pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities\", and through his sacrifice, he brings healing and forgiveness. Despite the controversy surrounding the interpretation of this chapter, it has been seen by many as to point to Jesus.\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

Dr. Tour is now a renowned chemist and has made significant discoveries in various areas of chemistry, including organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, materials science, and nanotechnology. He has also started successful companies and is a husband and father of four.\n\nDespite his accomplishments, Dr. Tour values his relationship with Jesus Christ above all else and is passionate about sharing the gospel with others. He openly declares the life-giving power of the gospel and boldly proclaims the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, whether it's through students gathering at his home, interviews with other scientists, or engaging with his thousands of followers on social media.\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

Dr. Tour believes that there is a calculated attack on people who disagree with the scientific community, and that the complexity of cells and the various arrangements of molecules necessary for life are not being adequately addressed. He suggests that projections made by scientists are often inaccurate, and that there are real problems with evolution. Despite his concerns, Dr. Tour encourages the scientific community to be more transparent about what they know and what is conjecture. He believes that if scientists were more precise, the distrust from the public towards the scientific community would decrease. \n\r\nFeatured:\nDon Page, Physicist\nDr James Tour, Organic Synthetic Chemist\n\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

      "description": "Originally streamed on @CapturingChristianity April 19, 2023.\n\nDr. William Lane Craig and Dr. Jim Tour engage in a conversation about the origins of life from a Christian perspective. Dr. Craig offers a theological viewpoint on the topic, emphasizing the integration of belief and the question of life's origin. He acknowledges Dr. Tour's expertise as a synthetic organic chemist and recognizes the neutral stance of science regarding the origin of life. Dr. Tour, on the other hand, discusses the challenges in the field of abiogenesis research, highlighting the difficulties in integrating the necessary components for life to emerge. The conversation covers topics such as molecular chirality, the complexity of cells, and the theological implications of the origin of life. Together, they provide insights into the intersection of Christianity and scientific inquiry into life's origins.\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

The process can be used on waste materials such as rubber, plastic, and food waste and is being scaled to ton-per-day production by summer. In addition, using this graphene for composites formation will be discussed, and a method of using natural gas for energy with zero CO2 emissions will be presented.\n\nThe FJH process can be used for urban mining electronics waste, obtaining rare earth elements from fly ash and bauxite residue, and one-step soil remediation of organics, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and heavy metals.\n\nAbout the 2023 guest lecturer\nDr. James M. Tour is the T. T. and W. F. Chao Professor of Chemistry and professor of materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University. He earned a Bachelor of Science in chemistry from Syracuse University and a PhD in synthetic organic and organometallic chemistry from Purdue University. He received postdoctoral training in synthetic organic chemistry at the University of Wisconsin and Stanford University. \n\nDr. Tour joined the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in 1999. His scientific research areas include a broad array of materials and nanomaterials chemistries with a special focus on synthesis of carbon materials. He has also developed strategies for retarding chemical terrorist attacks.\n\nIn 2021, Dr. Tour won the Oesper Award from the American Chemical Society which is awarded to outstanding chemists for lifetime significant accomplishments in the field of chemistry with long-lasting impact on the chemical sciences. He was listed in \u201cThe World\u2019s Most Influential Scientific Minds\u201d by Thomson Reuters in 2014,  inducted into the National Academy of Inventors in 2015, and was named among \u201cThe 50 Most Influential Scientists in the World Today\u201d by TheBestSchools.org in 2019.\n\nFor more information about the lecture, please contact Ben Forman at bforman02@hamline.edu.\n\nAbout the lectures\nThe 3M/Ronald A. Mitsch Lectures in Chemistry are part of the 3M/Ronald A. Mitsch Endowed Fund in Chemistry, established in 1998 by the 3M Foundation in recognition and appreciation of Dr. Mitsch.

      "description": "Galatians , Part 1\n\nIn this intriguing podcast episode, Dr. James Tour takes us on a journey through the captivating background of the Book of Galatians. Join Dr. Tour as he expertly unravels the historical context and sheds light on the challenges faced by the early Christian churches in the northeast region of the Mediterranean, known as Galatia. These churches, including Antioch, Placidia, Iconium, Lystra, and Derby, were founded by none other than the renowned Apostle Paul himself.\n\nDr. James Tour discusses how Paul's letter to the Galatians was intended as an encyclical, reaching out to all the churches in the region. With fervor and conviction, Paul passionately defends the true Gospel against the infiltration of false teachings. The primary challenge he addresses is the belief that adherence to the Old Testament law is a prerequisite for having a relationship with Jesus Christ.\n\nAs we explore this pivotal letter, guided by Dr. Tour's expertise, we witness Paul's unwavering stand on salvation by grace alone through faith in Jesus Christ. Paul firmly rejects any notion of justification by human works and instead emphasizes the significance of faith in Christ's redemptive sacrifice.\n\nTune in to Dr. James Tour's illuminating insights into the profound truths presented in Galatians. Discover how Paul's teachings remain deeply relevant in our lives today. Whether you are familiar with the book or entirely new to it, this podcast, led by Dr. James Tour, will enrich your understanding of the early Christian struggles and the timeless message of salvation through grace alone. Embark on this spiritual journey and find inspiration in the apostle's powerful response to false teachings in the Book of Galatians.\n\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

      "description": "Galatians, Part 3\n\nIn a discussion led by Dr. James Tour, the focus is on the book of Galatians and the apostle Paul's reaction to various accusations against him. Dr. Tour highlights Paul's significant calling to preach among the Gentiles, which comes after a transformative encounter with Jesus on the road to Damascus. Before heading to Jerusalem, Paul spends three years in Arabia, immersing himself in his mission. Despite being relatively unknown by sight to the churches in Judea, news of his conversion and preaching among the Gentiles spreads, leading to their glorification of God. Dr. Tour emphasizes the crucial importance of a genuine and passionate calling to ministry, cautioning against pursuing it lightly. He also stresses the value of submitting to church authority, as evidenced in Paul's interactions with the apostles in Jerusalem.\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

Now you see people talking about non-enzymatic RNA replication and calling that \"autocatalytic sets.\" If that's what you want to call it, that's fine.

      "description": "From https://news.rice.edu/news/2024/rices-james-tour-named-national-academy-engineering:\n\nRice University chemist James Tour was named to the National Academy of Engineering (NAE), one of the highest professional distinctions accorded \u201cin recognition of distinguished contributions\u201d to the field.\n\nTour, the T.T. and W.F. Chao Professor, professor of chemistry and of materials science and nanoengineering and of computer science, was recognized for his research on the \u201csynthesis, fabrication, properties, applications and commercialization of novel forms of carbon and their composites and derivatives.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am deeply grateful to my colleagues for putting me forward for this honor,\u201d Tour said. \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful to join the ranks of Rice engineers that bear this honor, and to see our work on carbon materials recognized. We think of the impact our research will have in the real world, and aim to put our findings in the context of current needs and challenges we face as a society.\u201d\n\nTour\u2019s research areas include organic synthesis, chemical biology, spectroscopy and imaging, and nanomaterials synthesis. His work has helped drive discovery and innovation in new materials synthesis through techniques such as flash Joule heating, laser-induced graphene, and single-molecule nanomachine synthesis for biomedical applications.\n\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

Rice University students managed to obtain some tiles and develop related technologies despite this restriction.\n\nNanotechnology Initiatives and Funding: The U.S. government has invested around $40 billion in nanotechnology since 1999, starting with Bill Clinton's administration and continuing through subsequent administrations. Nanotechnology is now integrated into various national programs instead of being a separate entity.\n\nNanotechnology in Products: Nanotechnology has become an integral part of many products, though it is not always labeled due to public hesitation. Products must have dimensions between 1 to 100 nanometers to be considered nanotechnology.\n\nApplications and Advancements: The lecture covers the development and applications of nanomaterials like carbon nanotubes, highlighting their unique properties, such as extreme strength and microwave absorption capabilities. The field has grown through shared research and collaboration.\n\nHistorical and Personal Anecdotes: The talk includes historical references to key figures and milestones in nanotechnology, personal anecdotes from Dr. James Tour\u2019s experiences, and examples of how nanotechnology has been applied in various scientific and industrial contexts.\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

Graphene's properties change with the number of layers and their alignment.\n\nGraphene Production Methods: Several methods to produce graphene include liquid exfoliation, oxidation, growth on silicon carbide, and chemical vapor deposition. Each method has varying yields and quality of graphene.\n\nAuthentication with Graphene Markers: Dr. James Tour discusses using graphene markers to authenticate high-end products like purses and shoes by embedding markers that can be detected via a smartphone.\n\nElectronic Properties and Potential: Graphene and carbon nanotubes exhibit high electronic mobility, theoretically up to a million cm\u00b2/Vs, which could significantly speed up computing processes.\n\nCommercial and Research Applications: Graphene's diverse applications include transparent conductive films, deicing surfaces, enhancing plastic bottle performance, and potential use in spinal cord injury treatment. Research also explores producing graphene from various carbon sources.\n\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

      "description": "#science #startup #nuclear #prepper \nChallenges in University Startups: Starting a company based on university research can be more effective than licensing to large corporations. However, it involves challenges like managing relationships, intellectual property, and navigating business dynamics, which can strain academic collaborations.\n\nPatents and Intellectual Property: Intellectual property protection is crucial and costly. The Bayh-Dole Act of 1980 allowed universities to retain ownership of federally funded inventions, spurring startup growth. Filing provisional patents is relatively inexpensive, providing time to develop the invention further before filing a full patent.\n\nFunding and Business Advice: Various funding sources for startups include government grants (SBIR, STTR), angel investors, and venture capitalists. Managing these relationships and understanding the business landscape, including the role of a board of directors, is essential for the success of a startup.\n\nNuclear Event Response: In the event of a nuclear explosion in a city, immediate action is necessary to address the radiation plume, as it can start affecting the city within three hours. Radiation first damages the stem cells in the small intestines, leading to severe health impacts.\n\nDevelopment of Radioprotectant: After 9/11, a need arose for an oral drug that could protect people from radiation exposure quickly. The drug developed, WR2721, showed significant protective effects in mice subjected to high doses of radiation.\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.

For example, \u201cwho is going to vote for a person looking like this?\u201d is a fallacy because appearance has nothing to do with one\u2019s leadership abilities.\n\n\"You're trying to protect your religion, liar!\" \ud83d\ude21\n\ud83d\ude18 Circumstantial ad hominem (or appeal to motive) argues that a person\u2019s circumstances, such as their job, political affiliation, religion or other vested interests, motivate their argument and thus it must be biased and false. For example, a salesperson may tell you that the pair of jeans you\u2019re trying on looks good on you, and you may half-jokingly point out that of course they think so since they want to make a sale.\n\n---\nIf you would like to support us in creating more content across our different media platforms, we would greatly appreciate any support you can give.
