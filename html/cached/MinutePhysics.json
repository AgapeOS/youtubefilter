Link to Patreon supporters here: www.minutephysics.com/supporters.html\n\nThe answer to this question has everything to do with drag & kinetic energy vs momentum change (thrust) \u2013 ie, a bigger engine fan allows for a larger air mass to be accelerated a smaller amount to give the same thrust as you\u2019d get from a smaller engine with larger acceleration. Any acceleration of air imparts energy to that air, which is in principle wasted energy, so ideally we minimize the acceleration of air while maintaining constant thrust, aka bigger engine fan. However, bigger fans have more drag, so there is an ultimate size limit.\n\nREFERENCES:\nA350 schematics - http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/a350/\n747 schematics - http://www.aerospaceweb.org/aircraft/jetliner/b747/\n\nMusic by Nathaniel Schroeder, http://www.soundcloud.com/drschroeder\n\nMinutePhysics is on Google+ - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6 \nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd twitter - @minutephysics\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

Throughout the universe there is a driving tendency for entropy to increase and free energy to be used up; however, sometimes there is some sort of barrier holding back further potential increase in entropy - these entropically favored but not directly possible reactions (like hydrogen nuclei fusing to become helium, or carbon dioxide reacting with hydrogen to form methane and water), *can* be achieved by larger systems, often complex or complicated, that allow multi-step reaction chains that ultimately lead to the entropically favored state. These systems, (stars, whose nuclei foster conditions amenable to fusion of hydrogen into helium, and life, which fosters conditions amenable to hydrogenating carbon dioxide) are naturally entropically favored, once they arise. And thus the purpose of both life, and stars, can be seen, in the context of the universe, as being a catalyst system that helps facilitate increases in entropy that are not otherwise possible.\n\nMusic for the series was especially composed by Nathaniel Schroeder, http://www.soundcloud.com/drschroeder\n\nREFERENCES & ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nHow Life Arose (Hydrogenating CO2 quote): https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/how-life-arose-on-earth-and-how-a-singularity-might-bring-it-down/\n\n\nSean\u2019s blog on this topic: https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/03/10/free-energy-and-the-meaning-of-life/\n\n\nMichael Russell article: http://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5645/580.summary\n\n\nThe molecular formula for Fructose: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fructose\n\n\nAdenosine Triphosphate (aka ATP): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adenosine_triphosphate\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen Fusion Reaction Chain: http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/nucene/fusion.html \nRichard Pogge (Ohio State University) on Stellar evolution: http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit2/lowmass.html \nStellar evolution lecture notes: http://astro.physics.uiowa.edu/~kaaret/s09/L14_starsevolve.pdf\nStellar evolution wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution \n\nSean's blog: http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/05/11/big-picture-part-four-complexity/\n\nSean Carroll: The Big Picture\n(more great articles about entropy, etc on his blog http://preposterousuniverse.com)\n\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on Google+ - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6 \nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd twitter - @minutephysics\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

Even though Albert Einstein (together with collaborators in the EPR Paradox paper) wanted to show that quantum mechanics must be incomplete because it was nonlocal (he didn't like \"spooky action at a distance\"), John Bell managed to prove that any local real hidden variable theory would have to satisfy certain simple statistical properties that quantum mechanical experiments (and the theory that describes them) violate. Since then, GHZ and others have managed to extend the theoretical work, and Alain Aspect performed the first Bell test experiment in the late 1980s.\n\nThanks to Vince Rubinetti for the music: https://soundcloud.com/vincerubinetti/one-two-zeta\n\nAnd thanks to Evan Miyazono, Aatish Bhatia, and Jasper Palfree for discussions and camaraderie during some of the inception of this video.\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nJohn Bell's Original Paper: http://inspirehep.net/record/31657/files/vol1p195-200_001.pdf\n\nQuantum Theory and Reality: https://www.scientificamerican.com/media/pdf/197911_0158.pdf\n\n\"What Bell Did\" By Tim Maudlin: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.1826\n\nBell's Theorem on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell%27s_theorem\n\n2015 experimental confirmation that QM violates Bell's theorem: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.05949.pdf\nhttps://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.250402\n\nBell's Theorem without Inequalities (GHZ): http://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.16243\n\nKochen-Specker Theorem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kochen\u2013Specker_theorem\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

Antimatter is very efficient but it is not naturally-occurring. Chemical reactions like fire or explosions are very inefficient. Nuclear fission and nuclear fusion are better, but not amazing on an absolute scale. Non-rotating black holes (Schwarzschild) and rotating (Kerr) are by far the most efficient, due to their accretion disks and very small radius of their innermost stable circular orbits.   \n\nREFERENCES:\nPeriodic Videos Hydrogen Explosion in slow motion: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qOTgeeTB_kA\n\nCIA World Factbook Norway Energy Consumption: https://web.archive.org/web/20120128032332/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2042rank.html\n\nBinding Energy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy\n\nHydrogen molecular bonding: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/chemistry/5-73-introductory-quantum-mechanics-i-fall-2005/lecture-notes/sec13.pdf\n\nGibbs free energy of water formation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Gibbs_free_energy_of_formation\n\nParty Balloon Size Chart: https://broadwaypartyrental.com/wp-content/uploads/HELIUM-BALOON-CHART.pdf\n\nMass Excess https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_excess\n\nTable of Mass Excesses: http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/masses/mass.mas12\n\nDeuterium-Tritium Hydrogen Fusion Energy Released: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=((deuterium+atomic+mass)%2B(tritium+atomic+mass)-(helium-4+atomic+mass)-(neutron+mass))%2F((deuterium+atomic+mass)%2B(tritium+atomic+mass))\n\nHydrogen to Helium Fusion chain efficiency: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(4(proton+mass)-(helium+4+atomic+mass))%2F(4(proton+mass))\n\nUranium-235 fission efficiency: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(neutron+mass%2B(uranium+235+atomic+mass)-(krypton+92+atomic+mass)-(barium+141+atomic+mass)-3(neutron+mass))%2F(neutron+mass%2B(uranium+235+atomic+mass))\n\nBlack Hole Accretion rates: http://www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/~garret/teaching/lecture7-2012.pdf\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

This is definitely not an academic course, but it's going to be a more in depth and developed exploration of a single topic than a typical standalone MinutePhysics video. I've been greatly inspired (and heckled) to do this by my friend Grant Sanderson of 3blue1brown who's set the standard for this kind of thing with his excellent series - serieses? - on calculus and linear algebra.\n\nSo, special relativity. Special relativity is one of the most popularly famous ideas in physics \u2013 it's that thing that Einstein figured out about the speed of light and space and time and E=mc^2! It changed our understanding of the universe. And its core ideas are accessible in principle to anyone who understands some basic algebra and geometry - you don't even need to know calculus!\n\nAnd yet in spite of this, special relativity is one of the subjects in physics that confuses the most people, and in many cases turns them away from physics altogether.\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

They cool off because the refrigerant inside (1,1-difluoroethane) is under pressure and boils off when the pressure lowers, and energy lost to the latent heat of vaporization cools the can a lot. Difluoroethane normally boils at -25\u00b0C (-13\u00b0F), but under ~6 atm (6 bar, 600 kpa) it is a liquid at room temperature. The gas also cools off slightly due to the Joule-Thompson effect of fluid expansion through a throttled valve. Difluoroethane is heavier than air and water soluble, so it is recommended to use it in a ventilated environment to clean your keyboard, etc. Also, 1,1-difluoroethane is a potent greenhouse gas. It is also known as Freon 152a, Ethylidene difluoride, Ethylidene fluoride, HFC-152a, R-152a, and DFE.\n\nThanks to Tino and Hannah!\n\nREFERENCES\n\nCRC Air Duster Safety Data Sheet\nhttp://docs.crcindustries.com/msds/5185.pdf\n\nLatent Heat of vaporization\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latentheat\n\n1,1-difluoroethane chemical and physical properties\nhttps://webbook.nist.gov/cgi/cbook.cgi?ID=C75376&Mask=3FFF\n\n1,1-difluoroethane on wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1,1-Difluoroethane\n\nFree Expansion of Real Gases, Goussard, 1993\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.17417\n\nJoule-Thompson Expansion Course Notes\nhttp://tccc.iesl.forth.gr/education/local/Labs-PC-II/JT.pdf\n\nProperties of 1,1-difluoroethane\nhttp://www.inchem.org/documents/sids/sids/75376.pdf\nhttps://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/11-difluoroethane\n\nMedical Effects of difluoroethane\nhttps://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/cgi-bin/sis/search/a?dbs+hsdb:@term+@DOCNO+5205\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

Later, it was discovered by the Slipher and Hubble red-shift that the universe is indeed expanding, and even later, by Schwarz and company in 1998, that the expansion is accelerating - aka, dark energy.

How To is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole. \n\nBestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90's kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of the book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun.\n\nBy exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in What If?, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. Full of clever infographics and amusing illustrations, How To is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nHow To (Randall Munroe) - see above for links!\n\nRock melting points\nhttp://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Geophys/meltrock.html\n\nSyracuse University Researchers Make Lava Using Keweenawan Basalt\nhttp://lavaproject.syr.edu/making-lava/making.html\n\nBEDROCK GEOLOGY OF WISCONSIN MAP: UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN\u2013EXTENSION Geological and Natural History Survey\n\nElectric Furnace\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Automatic-Electric-Refining-Precious-Aluminum/dp/B07LCKKFWX/\n\nLarge Geothermal Power Plants\nhttps://www.worldatlas.com/articles/largest-geothermal-power-plants-in-the-world.html\nhttps://www.calpine.com/operations/power-operations/our-locations/california/ridge-line\n\nCoal Power Plant Capacity\nhttps://www.talenenergy.com/plant/colstrip/\n\nThe size of an A19 or A21 Lightbulb\nhttps://blog.1000bulbs.com/home/a21-vs-a19\n\nLow melting point Vanadate glass\nhttps://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1143/JJAP.50.088002\n\nSupport MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

Einstein thought that general relativity implied that space had to be static and unchanging, but he had made a technical error regarding the differentiation of the metric (in particular, I believe he mistook the determinant of the metric for a scalar rather than a tensor density of weight 2). Friedmann didn't make this differential geometric mistake, and the cosmologies he found from the Einstein Equations were more varied in their properties - they could be expanding, or contracting, or (with the cosmological constant), static.\n\nSupport MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAlexander Friedmann\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Friedmann\n\nEinstein Wrongly Criticizes Alexander Friedmann\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol13-trans/301\n\nAlexander Friedmann Corrects Einstein\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol13-trans/363\n\nEinstein Admits his Mathematical Mistake\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol14-trans/77\n\nInterrogating the Legend of Einstein\u2019s \u201cBiggest Blunder\u201d\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/1804.06768\n\nCosmological Considerations in the General Theory of Relativity\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/433\n\nOn the General Theory of Relativity (Einstein)\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/110\n\nThe Field Equations of Gravitation\nhttps://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/129\n\nThe Einstein Field Equations\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_field_equations\n\nPresentation about the Sequence of Events\nhttp://web.mit.edu/8.286/www/slides07/Einstein-and-Friedmann.pdf\n\nTensor Densities:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_density\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\nAnd Google+ (does anyone use this any more?) - http://bit.ly/qzEwc6\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

The solutions to the Einstein Field Equations (including the schwarzschild metric, kerr metric, freedman-lemaitre-robertson-walker metric, etc) represent gravity around massive objects like the sun, earth, and black holes, but also the history and expansion and future evolution of the cosmos. The universe on a large scale is described by general relativity - on a small scale, quantum mechanics.

      "description": "Go to https://givewell.org/minutephysics to have your first donation matched up to $100!\n\nThis video is about the physics of geosynchronous and geostationary orbits, why they exist, when they don't, when they're useful for communication/satellite TV, etc.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nFraction of a sphere that's visible from a given distance\nhttps://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1329130/what-fraction-of-a-sphere-can-an-external-observer-see\n\nOrbital period\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_period\n\nKepler's third law\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law\n\nKepler's 3rd law (which can be derived from Newton's law of gravitation and the centripetal force necessary for orbit as mr\\omega^2=G\\frac{mM}{r^2}, and using \\omega=\\frac{2\\pi}{T}) is \nT = 2pi Sqrt(r^3/(GM)) where M is the mass of the central object, G is the gravitational constant. Alternatively, we can solve for r, r = (T^2/(4pi^2) GM)^(1/3) ~ T^(2/3)/M^(1/3) = (T^2/M)^(1/3).\n\nThere is a limit (kind of like the Roche limit but for rotations). A rotating solid steel ball or other chunk of metal that has tensile strength (ie that isn't just a pile of stuff held together by gravity like most planets) would be able to spin faster.\n\nCalculate how much of a planet's surface you can see from a given geosynchronous orbit/radius? (Obviously for lower ones you can see less, etc) - d/(2(R+d)) where d is distance to surface, ie, R is sphere radius, R+d is object radius from sphere center.\n\nLet's plug that in with r being the geostationary orbit radius. That is, we have \\frac{1}{2} \\left(1- \\left(\\frac{4 \\pi^2 R^3}{T^2 G M }\\right)^{1/3}\\right)\n\nAverage density of a sphere \\rho is given by \\rho =M/(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi R^3), ie \\rho=\\frac{3M}{4 \\pi R^3} aka\n\n\\frac{M}{R^3}=\\frac{4}{3}\\pi \\rho.\n\nSo we can convert the \"fraction of planet surface seen\" to \n\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(1- \\left(\\frac{3 \\pi}{G \\rho T^2}\\right)^{1/3}\\right)\n\nSo as either \\rho or T\\to \\infty, the fraction goes to a maximum of \\frac{1}{2}. And the point of \"singularity\" where the orbit coincides with the surface is where G\\rho T^2=3\\pi, aka \\rho=\\frac{3\\pi}{GT^2}. For a rotation period of 3600s, that corresponds to  a density \\rho \\approx 11000kg/m^3, which is roughly twice the density of the earth. For a rotation period of 5400s, we have \\rho\\approx 4800kg/m^3, which is basically the density of the earth.\n\nAlternately, if we plug the density of the earth in to an orbit of period 5400s, we get as a fraction of the planet seen:\n\n\\frac{1}{2} \\left(1- \\left(\\frac{3 \\pi}{G \\rho T^2}\\right)^{1/3}\\right) = 0.02\n\naka 2\\% of the earth's surface.\n\n\n\nSupport MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\r\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\r\n\r\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\r\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\r\n\r\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\r\n\r\nCreated by Henry Reich",

That amounts to ~0.25-0.35mm of sweat (covering the whole body) evaporated in an hour, or 6 micrometers every minute.\n\nWater has latent heat of 2,270 kJ/kg (http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/water-thermal-properties-d_162.html), so in an hour a human can lose ~1100-1700 kJ of energy. (2270/4.1868 ~ 542 Cal)\n\nBUT that assumes all of the energy came from the person. If some proportion of it came from the air (~1/3-1/2?) then the person is only cooled down partially.\n\nMass of a human ~ 60-80kg (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_weight), assuming ~specific heat of water, ie 4 kJ/kg/K, could decrease temp by ~4.5-5\u00b0C.\n\nEnergy used in moderate-hard exercise is ~20-30 kJ/kg/30 min, or ~40-60kJ/kg/h (http://www.weightloss.com.au/weight-loss/weight-loss-tools/exercise-energy-charts.html). Let\u2019s say 50kJ/kg/h, which for average human amounts to 3000-4000 kJ/hr\n\n**********************************\n\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich",

To match our experience, cameras have to do this, too, \"balancing\" the colors of an image so that a white object looks white under a given light, rather than some other color. And the typical unit to measure the color of a light is the Kelvin. Which is weird, because Kelvin is a unit  for measuring temperature, not color. What temperature and the color in a photograph have to do with each other comes down to history and physics.\n\nSupport MinutePhysics on Patreon! http://www.patreon.com/minutephysics\r\nLink to Patreon Supporters: http://www.minutephysics.com/supporters/\r\n\r\nMinutePhysics is on twitter - @minutephysics\r\nAnd facebook - http://facebook.com/minutephysics\r\n\r\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\r\n\r\nCreated by Henry Reich",
