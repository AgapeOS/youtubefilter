      "description": "When you're in a relationship, you want to be a team, right? That's why many couples start commingling their money. But here's the thing - it can take away a sense of freedom, and you may end up resenting each other. And that's the last thing you want in a relationship.\n\nSo, here's what you should do instead - determine a percentage of your income that each of you will put into your joint account. That way, if you make different incomes, it's fair to both of you.\n\nThis helps you maintain your individuality while having a joint account to make big decisions together. This can be a game-changer in your relationship and it'll help you avoid money-related stress in your relationship. \ud83d\udc91\n\nThis is my OPINION. I\u2019d love to hear yours on this topic.
