      "description": "Madame Delphine LaLaurie, New Orleans' most reviled serial killer, has become world famous thanks to American Horror Story and the wildly popular French Quarter ghost tour industry. The story of this deranged socialite who tortured, mutilated, and murdered her slaves has lost none of its horrifying bite, and the supposedly haunted mansion where her home once stood has become a major tourist attraction. Despite its popularity (or perhaps because of it), this story is steeped in legend and folklore. Most online sources about LaLaurie's crimes are outdated, wrong, or both. In this video I attempt to separate the truth from the myth, and tell a purely historical account of the crimes of Delphine LaLaurie.\n\nOne of my patrons is running in the 2020 Boston Marathon!

It takes place in Massachusetts shortly after King Philip's War, and follows two Puritan witch hunters on a mission to track down and destroy a coven of devil worshippers.\n\nOur intention is to take audiences on a fun, creepy, and surreal trip to 17th century New England. The dialogue, accents, and costumes will be painstakingly authentic \u2013 our efforts at historical accuracy in pre-production have even met with @Brandon F.'s approval! Hopefully our execution can do our concept justice \u2013 and if we fail spectacularly, then hey, Brandon and I will make a video tearing it to pieces.\n\nUpon completion, we will submit THE SUDBURY DEVIL to film festivals and hopefully get it distributed on some streaming platforms. There are tons of companies out there that rake in low budget B-movies for distribution, and with the recent spike in the popularity of quirky witchcraft films (A Field in England, The Witch, and Gretel & Hansel, to name a few), I think our film is marketable. It would be awesome if this was a wild success and I made a fortune, but that's not likely, and in any event I'm not expecting to make money from it. It's a passion project for everyone involved.\n\nSupport Atun-Shei Films on Patreon \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/atunsheifilms\n\nBuy Merch \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/atun-shei-films\n\nOfficial Website \u25ba https://www.atunsheifilms.com/",

      "description": "When talking about historical fiction films, historians and history buffs use the same two words over and over again: accuracy and authenticity. The first refers to strict adherence to historical fashion, customs, and events. The second is a little more nebulous, and refers more to how a historical movie \"feels.\" I would use a more specific word: immersion. To me, a period piece succeeds if it's well made enough to \u2013 with a little imagination \u2013 transport you to a different time. In this video essay, I recommend ten movies that, in my opinion, accomplish just that.\n\nSupport Atun-Shei Films on Patreon \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/atunsheifilms\n\nLeave a Tip via Paypal \u25ba https://www.paypal.me/atunsheifilms\n\nBuy Merch \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/atun-shei-films\n\nOfficial Website \u25ba https://www.atunsheifilms.com/",

Standish came over on the Mayflower, and commanded the militia of the Plymouth Pilgrims in the 1620s; Church lived his whole life in the New World, and led the crack troops that tracked down Metacomet, sachem of the Pokanoket Wampanoag, during King Philip's War in the 1670s. Standish carried an elegant German rapier, while Church used a simple naval cutlass. What changed? And what story can these two swords tell about the men who wielded them?\n\nSupport Atun-Shei Films on Patreon \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/atunsheifilms\n\nLeave a Tip via Paypal \u25ba https://www.paypal.me/atunsheifilms\n\nBuy Merch \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/atun-shei-films\n\nOfficial Website \u25ba https://www.atunsheifilms.com/\n\n~REFERENCES~\n\n[1] Jeremy Dupertuis Bangs: \u201cMyles Standish, Born Where?

      "description": "In the late 1870s, a former congressman named Ignatius Donnelly sat down to write a book about Atlantis. His ideas went on to singlehandedly kickstart the modern obsession with Plato's mythical lost city, and inspired countless other related conspiracy theories. Today, he's regarded as the father of pseudoarchaeology.\n\nWith the expert help of fellow history YouTubers @HistorywithCy and @WorldofAntiquity, I explore the legend of Atlantis through the lens of Ignatius Donnelly's life and legacy. Though informed more by his own distaste with Gilded Age America than any legitimate archaeological evidence, Donnelly's feverish theories have enjoyed remarkable longevity \u2013 in fact, you've probably heard one or two of them on the History Channel.\n\nBe sure to check out these related videos:\n\n\"Ancient Aliens!

In this video, we examine the uprising primarily from a military perspective, discussing the weaponry the enslaved army used, the tactics they employed, and the likelihood of the rebels' long-term success if their battle with the local planter militia had gone a little bit differently.\n\nThe 1811 Revolt, despite being the largest rebellion of enslaved people in American history, has not been the subject of much scholarship, and in many ways is still poorly understood. Regardless, we were surprised how much our visit forced us to rethink the conventional historical narrative. In Karl's companion video, we discuss alternative perspectives of the revolt and speculate about what truths may have been lost to history.

Some time after Thorvald Erikson's disastrous voyage to the mysterious lands west of Greenland, a wealthy Icelander named Thorfinn Karlsefni financed and led an expedition of his own, with the goal of establishing a permanent Norse settlement in Vinland.

      "description": "Demonology is a treatise on witchcraft and the occult written by King James VI of Scotland (later James I of England), first published in 1597. The book was a major influence on the Puritan witch hunters of the 17th century, including Matthew Hopkins (the infamous \"Witchfinder General\" of the English Civil War) and the prosecutors of the Salem Witch Trials.\n\nJames frames his argument in a Socratic dialogue between Epistemon, a wholehearted believer in witchcraft, and Philomathes, a skeptic. In this video, an actor will play both parts and present the abridged text of Demonology in the form of a theatrical performance.\n\nAs always on this channel, the Early Modern English dialogue will be spoken in Original Pronunciation, a reconstructed accent which approximates with reasonable certainty the dialect of southern England in the Jacobean era. Subtitles are included to aid in comprehension, and James' original spelling has been modified to make the text more accessible to modern audiences.\n\nKing James believed he was the target of an international Satanic conspiracy \u2013 he was personally involved in the infamously lethal North Berwick Witch Trials of the 1590s, an experience which had a profound impact on him and inspired him to write Demonology.

In this episode of The Abolitionists, we dive deep into Delany's manifesto and examine how his beliefs and activism changed over the course of his long and dynamic life.\n\nThanks to @FDSignifire for reading the quotes.\n\nSupport Atun-Shei Films on Patreon \u25ba https://www.patreon.com/atunsheifilms\n\nLeave a Tip via Paypal \u25ba https://www.paypal.me/atunsheifilms\n\nBuy Merch \u25ba https://teespring.com/stores/atun-shei-films\n\nOfficial Website \u25ba https://www.atunsheifilms.com/\n\n~REFERENCES~\n\n[1] Eleanor Stanford. \u201cMartin R.
