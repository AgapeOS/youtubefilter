Wallace shows that the impact of Jesus is unparalleled by anyone else in History by a massive margin. In the video, Wallace brings to light the extent of Jesus' influence on the world as well as what this all points the researcher to regarding the age of question of whether Jesus was a myth, a man, or, in fact, the Messiah.

We also analyze what has been left in its wake & how believers can best speak into this bizarre cultural moment where large swathes of Western civilization are now both post-Christian & post-Atheist.\n\nIn the rubble of deconstruction and disillusionment, how do we help people begin to put the pieces back together?\n\nAbout Alister McGrath:\n\nHe has 3 earned doctorates from Oxford: \n1. Molecular Biophysics,\n2. Theology,\n3. Intellectual History.\n\nHe has also served as a Professor at Oxford, Cambridge and Regent in Canada & has published over 50 books.

Along the way, she unpacks the critical realization that Science, as wonderful as it is, is not the only vehicle to bring us to Truth and that many aspects of human life simply fall outside the view of Science. She then explains her process of seeking answers to those huge Why questions that go beyond mere process or mechanism.

RENOUNCING ANY AND ALL DEMONIC SPIRITS.\nIn the name of Jesus, I RENOUNCE any and all, associated and attached, demonic spirits, and COMMAND that you leave me.\nDear Lord Jesus, please forgive me for whatever it is that I have done to open the door to these demonic spirits. Please forgive me, I pray. In Jesus\u2019 Name.\nAny and all, associated and attached demonic spirits, I come against you and declare you are done and finished. You must leave me now because I have authority over you, in Jesus\u2019 Name!\n\n2. DEALING WITH EMOTIONAL TRANSFERENCES (PROJECTIONS).\nLord, I lift up to you any transferences from other people. Lord, forgive me for any part that I may have played.\nCome now, Holy Spirit. Fill any place in me where transferences may have landed. Fill those places with Your Light, Your Love, Your Spirit, and burn away the effects of those sins, in Jesus' Name.\n\n3. DEALING WITH ANY ASSIGNED SPIRITS.\nLord, if any demonic spirit has been assigned to me by anyone\u2014in willing cooperation or without knowledge:\nI take the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and I sever any and all, associated and attached, assigned demonic spirits from me now. \nI see these spirits fly off into the darkness, never to return to cause harm to me, my family, and friends. In Jesus' Name. \n\n4. DEALING WITH FALLEN ANGELIC POWERS (*Celestial Beings=Glorious Ones, Jude 8; 2 Pet. 2:10).\nLord, if there are any celestial beings working against me, I ask that you call these celestial beings into your Holy Presence to judge them. \nI ask Lord that you remove these from my life and send them far from me, to a place of your choosing.
