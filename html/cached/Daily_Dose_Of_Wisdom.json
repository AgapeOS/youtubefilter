Please forgive me, I pray. In Jesus\u2019 Name.\nAny and all, associated and attached demonic spirits, I come against you and declare you are done and finished. You must leave me now because I have authority over you, in Jesus\u2019 Name!\n\n2. DEALING WITH EMOTIONAL TRANSFERENCES (PROJECTIONS).\nLord, I lift up to you any transferences from other people. Lord, forgive me for any part that I may have played.\nCome now, Holy Spirit. Fill any place in me where transferences may have landed. Fill those places with Your Light, Your Love, Your Spirit, and burn away the effects of those sins, in Jesus' Name.\n\n3. DEALING WITH ANY ASSIGNED SPIRITS.\nLord, if any demonic spirit has been assigned to me by anyone\u2014in willing cooperation or without knowledge:\nI take the Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, and I sever any and all, associated and attached, assigned demonic spirits from me now. \nI see these spirits fly off into the darkness, never to return to cause harm to me, my family, and friends. In Jesus' Name. \n\n4. DEALING WITH FALLEN ANGELIC POWERS (*Celestial Beings=Glorious Ones, Jude 8; 2 Pet. 2:10).\nLord, if there are any celestial beings working against me, I ask that you call these celestial beings into your Holy Presence to judge them. \nI ask Lord that you remove these from my life and send them far from me, to a place of your choosing. In Jesus' Name.\n\nMy Links:\nWEBSITE: https://dailydoseofwisdom.com/\nWATCH My Documentary Film (FREE): https://www.dailydoseofwisdom.co/register-to-watch-yt\nJOIN The Wisdom Society: https://www.dailydoseofwisdom.co/join-the-wisdom-society\n\nMy Socials:\nSpotify: https://open.spotify.com/show/51Wmr5SwvuRh8uOvxzX0Q3\nApple: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/daily-dose-of-wisdom/id1755183270\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/the_daily_dose_of_wisdom/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/dailydoseofwisdomofficial",
