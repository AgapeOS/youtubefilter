      "description": "Make this homemade wassail recipe to evoke all those holiday feels and conjure up memories of times spent together. \n\nWassail is traditionally a warm cider drink with the flavors of apple cider, orange juice and mulling spices (like cinnamon and clove) served during the holidays. \n\nMix this up for your next gathering and enjoy the delicious aroma as it fills your home. \n\nGrab the full recipe on the BLOG: https://rootsandrefuge.com/homemade-wassail\n\n*********************\n\nHey ya'll, I'm Jess from Roots & Refuge Farm \n\nWelcome to a place that feels like home. A small farm with a big family. We hope you'll pull up a chair, grab some coffee and visit awhile. \n\nThere was a time that all I wanted in the world was a little farm where I could raise my family and grow our food. Now, that is exactly what exists outside my door. In watching it unfold, a new dream was formed in my heart \u2013 to share this beautiful life with others and teach them the lessons we've learned along the way. Welcome to our journey, friend. I am so glad you're here. \n\n*********************\n\nWHERE TO FIND US (Some of the links here are affiliate links.

We hope you'll pull up a chair, grab some coffee and visit awhile. \n\nThere was a time that all I wanted in the world was a little farm where I could raise my family and grow our food. Now, that is exactly what exists outside my door. In watching it unfold, a new dream was formed in my heart \u2013 to share this beautiful life with others and teach them the lessons we've learned along the way. Welcome to our journey, friend. I am so glad you're here. \n\n*********************\n\nWHERE TO FIND US (Some of the links here are affiliate links.
