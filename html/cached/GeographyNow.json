If for any reason you find yourself in Armenia \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddf2 from October 14 to the 16th, feel free to sign up for this festival, $50 off if you use the code : Barbs at https://www.extraordinarytravelfest.com/\n\nAlso, I figure, since I\u2019m there, why don\u2019t I try to cross over and visit #Georgia \ud83c\uddec\ud83c\uddeaand #Azerbaijan \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddff? If you are in either of those countries let me know! Maybe we could do another geograpeep meet up!
