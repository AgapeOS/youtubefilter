I was invited to be a guest speaker at the Extraordinary travel festival in Yerevan, such a huge honor and thank you guys so much for allowing me this opportunity! While I am there, why not also go to #Georgia?\n\nof course I would love to see all three countries however I\u2019m sure many of you are aware of the current conflict that is going on which will hinder me from doing so. Maybe in the future. As of right now though, I look forward to this event and maybe even possibly meeting some of you guys the subscribers!",
