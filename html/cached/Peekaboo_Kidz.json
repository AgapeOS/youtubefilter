They're immediately recognizable by their distinctive black-and-white coloring. Smart and social, orcas make a wide variety of communicative sounds, and each pod has distinctive noises that its members will recognize even at a distance. They use echolocation to communicate and hunt, making sounds that travel underwater until they encounter objects, then bounce back, revealing their location, size, and shape.\n\n#killerwhales #orcas #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved.\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

Some of these are speculated or known to be hoaxes.\n\n#yeti #bigfoot #abominablesnowman #unveilingtheunknown #peekabookidz #drbinocsshow \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved.\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "#shorts \n\nAccording to western history, the first coins found were in modern-day Turkey. This was known in ancient times as the Lydian Kingdom. These coins, found around 700 B.C. did not require intricate machines to be created. The coins were a naturally occurring combination of gold and silver, known as electrum. In order to make the coins stand out from any other mineral, the Lydians carved designs into one side of the coin. The other side was marked with indents. Perhaps as another means of making the currency stand out. It is speculated that the coins were weighed in order to determine their value. This makes sense as it was hard to create a consistent design for all the coins. In addition, the coins came in different shapes and sizes since they were used in their current state. \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

Over 3,700 types of mosquitoes can be found worldwide.\nWhen a mosquito bites you, it pierces the skin using a special mouthpart (proboscis) to suck up blood. As the mosquito is feeding, it injects saliva into your skin. Your body reacts to the saliva resulting in a bump and itching.

In the La Brea tar pits of California, scientists have recovered over a million bones. This includes one of the largest and best-preserved collections of sabertooth (Smilodon fatalis) bones in the world. Data collected from the La Brea tar pits helps scientists piece together the natural history of the area, including the history of the sabertooth cat. Scientists have learned that the sabertooth cat first appeared in the archaeological record two million years ago. Sabertooths ranged widely throughout North and South America and are related to modern cats. However, no real descendents of the sabertooth cat are alive today.\n\n#sabertoothtiger #prehistoricanimals #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved.\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "#shorts \n\n#internationaldogday #doglovers #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nDogs possess a sense of smell many times more sensitive than even the most advanced man-made instrument. Powerful enough to detect substances at concentrations of one part per trillion\u2014a single drop of liquid in 20 Olympic-size swimming pools. With training, dogs can sniff out bombs and drugs, pursue suspects, and find dead bodies. And more and more, they\u2019re being used experimentally to detect human disease\u2014cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, and now, malaria\u2014from smell alone.\n\nDogs' noses also function quite differently than our own. When we inhale, we smell and breathe through the same airways within our nose. When dogs inhale, a fold of tissue just inside their nostril helps to separate these two functions.\n\nWhen we exhale through our nose, we send the spent air out the way it came in, forcing out any incoming odors. When dogs exhale, the spent air exits through the slits in the sides of their noses. The manner in which the exhaled air swirls out actually helps usher new odors into the dog's nose. More importantly, it allows dogs to sniff more or less continuously.\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

They're immediately recognizable by their distinctive black-and-white coloring. Smart and social, orcas make a wide variety of communicative sounds, and each pod has distinctive noises that its members will recognize even at a distance. They use echolocation to communicate and hunt, making sounds that travel underwater until they encounter objects, then bounce back, revealing their location, size, and shape.\n\n#killerwhales #orcas #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

These interesting characteristics have contributed to its success in its home country of the United States, and it has inspired many popular toys with Slinky-like components, in a wide range of countries.\n\n#slinky #inventions #richardtjames #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved.\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a massive hot ball of plasma, inflated and heated by nuclear fusion reactions at its core. Part of this internal energy is emited from the Sun's surface as light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation, providing most of the energy for life on Earth.\nIf Sun is replaced by another star in our existing solar system then planets may not continue orbiting that star. It all depends on the mass of that star. If it is heavier than sun then planets may ultimately collapse into it or may take different orbits.\nArcturus is the brightest star in the northern constellation of Bo\u00f6tes. With an apparent visual magnitude of \u22120.05, it is the fourth-brightest star in the night sky, and the brightest in the northern celestial hemisphere.\n\n#sun #arcturus #whatif #adityal1 #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved.\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nWhich Is The Largest Star In Our Galaxy? - https://youtu.be/4HLIIiqy2_k\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au and atomic number 79. It is a bright, slightly orange-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal in pure form. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions.\nGold is mined by 4 different methods. Placer mining, hard rock mining, byproduct mining and by processing gold ore. Each of these categories has it's own unique methods of extracting the gold from the surrounding materials.\nIn its natural form, it is found deep in the layers of the earth where it is transported by water, molten lava and volcanic eruptions, and earthquakes.

In the La Brea tar pits of California, scientists have recovered over a million bones. This includes one of the largest and best-preserved collections of sabertooth (Smilodon fatalis) bones in the world. Data collected from the La Brea tar pits helps scientists piece together the natural history of the area, including the history of the sabertooth cat. Scientists have learned that the sabertooth cat first appeared in the archaeological record two million years ago. Sabertooths ranged widely throughout North and South America and are related to modern cats. However, no real descendents of the sabertooth cat are alive today.\n\n#sabertoothtiger #prehistoricanimals #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

And more and more, they\u2019re being used experimentally to detect human disease\u2014cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, and now, malaria\u2014from smell alone.\n\nDogs' noses also function quite differently than our own. When we inhale, we smell and breathe through the same airways within our nose. When dogs inhale, a fold of tissue just inside their nostril helps to separate these two functions.\n\nWhen we exhale through our nose, we send the spent air out the way it came in, forcing out any incoming odors. When dogs exhale, the spent air exits through the slits in the sides of their noses. The manner in which the exhaled air swirls out actually helps usher new odors into the dog's nose. More importantly, it allows dogs to sniff more or less continuously.\n\n#internationaldogday #doglovers #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "#ytshorts \n\nEpilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by repeated seizures. A seizure is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain. Normally, the brain continuously generates tiny electrical impulses in an orderly pattern.\nInternational Epilepsy Day is observed on the second Monday of February each year. In 2024, it falls on February 12th. It's a day for individuals, organizations, and communities to come together and make a difference in the lives of those affected by epilepsy.\n\n#epilepsy #internationalepilepsyday #seizuredisorder #drbinocsshow \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

The company aims to create devices that can directly link the human brain with computers and other external devices, potentially enabling a wide range of applications, from restoring motor functions in individuals with paralysis to augmenting human cognition.\n\nThe Neuralink brain chip, also known as the Neuralink device or implant, is designed to be implanted into the brain and establish a high-bandwidth interface with neural circuits. The chip consists of a multitude of tiny electrodes that can both record and stimulate brain activity. These electrodes are intended to be minimally invasive, allowing for precise interaction with neurons without causing significant damage to brain tissue.\n\n#neuralink #elonmusk #brainchip #futuretechnology #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved. \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified.A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\n\n#nationalvaccinationday #vaccine #antibodies #peekabookidz \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

These monsters are not real and are typically found in literature, mythology, folklore, movies, television shows, video games, and other forms of storytelling. They often possess supernatural, otherworldly, or extraordinary characteristics that set them apart from ordinary creatures or beings.\n\nFictional monsters serve various purposes in storytelling. They can embody fears, symbolize human struggles, provide obstacles for heroes to overcome, or simply entertain audiences with their fantastical qualities.

He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\n#peekabookidz #drbinocsshow #williamshakespeare #romeojuliet #williamshakespearequotes #hamlet #lifestory \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved\n\nAnne Frank  - https://youtu.be/CGBjMfaiFs8\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "Snakes serve critical role as predators, as preys, as ecosystem engineers, and provide economic and therapeutic benefits to humans. Snakes are also a source of many medicines. The only proven and effective therapy for snakebite - the snake-anti venom, is also derived from snake venoms.\nAs predators, snakes keep prey populations in balance. For example, rodents reproduce exponentially in the absence of predators, as long as there is plenty of food. This is particularly true in environments dominated by humans.\n\n#snakes #whatifscenario #whatiffacts #snakesinthecity #peekabookidz #drbinocsshow \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved\n\nInland Taipan - https://youtu.be/kmeDVD5ToPU\nWhat If The Titanoboa Didn't Go Extinct - https://youtu.be/jV9sYQzSlh4\nSnakes - https://youtu.be/xlIxjtTJrq4\nWhat If a Python Swallows You - https://youtu.be/748eIzO2XnA\nWhat Does Snake's Venom Do To Your Body?  - https://youtu.be/ymdzYuZWsko\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

The company aims to create devices that can directly link the human brain with computers and other external devices, potentially enabling a wide range of applications, from restoring motor functions in individuals with paralysis to augmenting human cognition.\n\nThe Neuralink brain chip, also known as the Neuralink device or implant, is designed to be implanted into the brain and establish a high-bandwidth interface with neural circuits. The chip consists of a multitude of tiny electrodes that can both record and stimulate brain activity. These electrodes are intended to be minimally invasive, allowing for precise interaction with neurons without causing significant damage to brain tissue.\n\n#neuralink #elonmusk #brainchip #futuretechnology #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

Almost all spiders produce venom but only a few are classified as \"venomous\" and able to cause significant harm to humans.\nThe Brazilian wandering spider (a ctenid spider) is a large brown spider similar to North American wolf spiders in appearance, although somewhat larger. It has a highly toxic venom and is regarded (along with the Australian funnel-web spiders) as among the most dangerous spiders in the world.\n\n#deadliestspiders #spider #venomousinsects #spiderbite #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved \n\nThese additional subjects might be of interest to you:-\nHow Do Ants Bite? - https://youtu.be/QHLVus71AzA\nWhat if a Centipede Bites You? - https://youtu.be/y1ZwAilU5IQ\nWhat Does Snake's Venom Do To Your Body? - https://youtu.be/ymdzYuZWsko\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

Its diet often consists of moths, crickets, grasshoppers, and flies, but larger mantises have also been known to attack prey several times their size, such as hummingbirds and small snakes. Mantises are typically colored green or brown, which allows them to blend with vegetation such as leaves, twigs, or flowers. This camouflage helps conceal them from both predators and prey, which they either stalk or ambush.\n\n#prayingmantis #deadliestinsects #camouflagemasters #insectsfacts #drbinocs #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved  \n\nAnt Mill - https://youtu.be/U4OVlFDlH-0\n\nWhat if a Bee Stings You? - https://youtu.be/H_wj50ox8OY\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "Newton's third law of motion states that for every action (force) in nature there is an equal and opposite reaction. If object A exerts a force on object B, object B also exerts an equal and opposite force on object A. In other words, forces result from interactions.\nYou can write the equation for this law as F A = \u2212 F B where A and B are variables indicating the objects. In this equation, FA represents the force applied by object 1 on object 2, while FB represents the force applied by object 2 on object 1. The negative sign indicates that these forces are in opposite directions.\n\n#newtonslawofmotion #3rdlawofmotion #motion #action #reaction #force #physicslaws #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved \n\nOur other videos on Newton's Laws:-\nNewton's First Law Of Motion - https://youtu.be/adLj6kygwds\nNewton's 2nd Law Of Motion - https://youtu.be/8o3j1wpabes\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "It\u2019s hard to know exactly when Friday the 13th became thought of as unlucky, but it likely comes from the Christian religion. For example, in the Bible, Judas\u2014a person who is said to have betrayed Jesus\u2014was the 13th guest at the Last Supper. Also in the Bible, many unfortunate things happened on Fridays. So it made sense that people who read the Bible got nervous around Friday the 13th.\n\nOne big superstition in the United States is that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day. Happening up to three times a year depending on the calendar, the day seems to make people more careful or avoid things they usually aren\u2019t afraid to do. \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved  \n\nCould Loch Ness Monster Be Real? - https://youtu.be/F4Q8kKS7FpM\n\nThe Dark Story Of Valentine's Day - https://youtu.be/CGKuDXUPxK4\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

They collect pollen from flowers while feeding on nectar and transfer it to other plants, which helps fruits, vegetables, and flowers produce seeds. They are indicators of a healthy ecosystem and help increase biodiversity. They are sensitive to environmental threats like habitat destruction and climate change, and can provide early warnings of biodiversity declines. If butterfly populations diminish (or disappear altogether!), the impact will be felt higher up and can affect the entire ecosystem.\n\n#butterfly #butterflies #insects #saveearth #peekabookidz #drbinocsshow #drbinocs\n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved\n\nLife Of A Butterfly :- https://youtu.be/dM71jKNuk-M\n\nButterFly Effect :- https://youtu.be/mZv5xMIdaMo\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

When you eat food, the chemical substances that are responsible for the food\u2019s taste come into contact with nerve cells in the mouth. The chemical substance activates the nerve cell by changing specific proteins in the wall of the sensory cell. This change causes the sensory cell to release chemical messengers, which in turn activate further nerve cells. These nerve cells then pass the \u201ctaste\u201d information on to the brain.\n\n#tastebuds #tastesense #taste #spicy #sweet #bitter #salty #savory #sensesofourbody #peekabookidz #drbinocsshow #drbinocs\n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved\n\nThe Five Senses - https://youtu.be/9uQSfOEFvgA\n\nHow Your Tongue Works - https://youtu.be/9uQSfOEFvgA\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

It's known for its massive size and predatory nature, making it one of the top apex predators of its time. The species was related to modern sperm whales but was much larger and had some unique features.\n\nLivyatan is famous for its large teeth, which could grow up to 36 cm (about 14 inches) long. These teeth, along with its powerful jaw, suggest it hunted large marine animals, including other whales. Its name is a reference to the biblical Leviathan, emphasizing its size and might.\n\n#livyatan #spermwhale #underwaterpredator #prehistoricanimals #peekabookidz #drbinocsshow \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved\n\nMegalodon Sharks - https://youtu.be/-ajB0KahjkA\n\nWhy Orcas Are Called Killer Whales - https://youtu.be/4fx9G-uGcXU\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\r\n\r\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\r\n\r\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\r\n\r\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\r\n\r\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\r\n\r\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\r\n\r\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

      "description": "A person's sense of smell is driven by certain processes. First, a molecule released from a substance (such as fragrance from a flower) must stimulate special nerve cells (called olfactory cells) found high up in the nose. These nerve cells then send information to the brain, where the specific smell is identified. Anything that interferes with these processes, such as nasal congestion, nasal blockage, or damage to the nerve cells themselves, can lead to loss of smell.\nLosing your sense of smell, also known as anosmia, can be temporary or permanent. It can be caused by a number of things, including colds, sinus infections, allergies, or other health conditions. \n\n#senseofsmell #lostsmell #anosmia #smellsissue #drbinocsshow #peekabookidz \n\nMake sure you watch the whole video to know all the answers to your curious questions! \n\nLeave your ideas, suggestions and questions for Dr. Binocs at this Email Id: peekabookidzfeedback@gmail.com\n\nFor more fun learning videos SUBSCRIBE to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/SubscribeTo-Peekabookidz\n\nCredits - \nCopyrights and Publishing: Rajshri Entertainment Private Limited \nAll rights reserved\n\nDogs Smelling Powers - https://youtu.be/LhEFTgXTRNs\n\nCatch Dr.Binocs At - https://goo.gl/SXhLmc\n\nTo Watch More Popular Nursery Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/CV0Xoo\n\nTo Watch Alphabet Rhymes Go To - https://goo.gl/qmIRLv\n\nTo Watch Compilations Go To - https://goo.gl/nW3kw9\n\nCatch More Lyricals At - https://goo.gl/A7kEmO\n\nSubscribe to Peekaboo Kidz: http://bit.ly/peekabookidz\n\nLike our Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/peekabootv",

Aphids therefore need to extract large quantities of sap in order to get sufficient protein.
